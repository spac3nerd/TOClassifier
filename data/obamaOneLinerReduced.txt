to chip,       
to walter's    
to the men of  
to all of you  
i am honored   
i did not know 
cronkite       
and my regret  
nor, for that  
what happened  
but like them  
it is a public 
even in his    
he wanted to   
during one of  
when walter    
walter replied 
you don't need 
needless to    
he lost his    
walter wasn't  
but he never   
he got along   
one politician 
he shared a    
president      
but walter     
his endless    
as a boy,      
and that's the 
he went        
he raced cars  
he traveled    
he plunged     
to make it     
and as our     
he was forever 
marches and    
scandal and    
calmly and     
he was a voice 
and through it 
he was a       
so it may have 
but here's the 
that title     
we weren't     
it was earned  
a commitment   
his belief     
he didn't      
when he was    
when people of 
and when, even 
through all    
and this is    
but we also    
it's a         
we know that   
even as        
despite the    
just as the    
and too often, 
what happened  
is replaced    
the public     
the public     
we fail to     
we seem stuck  
which price is 
which cost is  
this           
that's why the 
our future     
walter was no  
he understood  
he believed    
he was excited 
naturally, we  
in an era      
would he have  
would he still 
would he have  
and somehow,   
the simple     
our american   
it needs to be 
and if we      
walter         
that's why so  
that's why the 
and that's why 
he's reunited  
we are         
thank you very 
hello,         
thank you,     
all right,     
how is         
how about tim  
i am here with 
and we've got  
and i am just  
and i want to  
give           
i know that    
and for those  
i imagine      
and no matter  
i know that    
when i was     
i lived in     
and my mother, 
so she decided 
but because    
30 in the      
now, as you    
and a lot of   
but whenever   
so i know that 
but i'm here   
i'm here       
now, i've      
and i've       
i've talked    
i've talked    
i've talked a  
but at the end 
that's what i  
the            
i want to      
every single   
every single   
and you have a 
that's the     
maybe you      
maybe you      
maybe you      
and no matter  
you want to be 
you want to be 
you're going   
you cannot     
you've got to  
and this isn't 
what you make  
the future of  
what you're    
you'll need    
you'll need    
you'll need    
we need every  
if you don't   
now, i know    
i know a lot   
i know what    
my father left 
there were     
there were     
so i wasn't    
and my life    
but i was   i  
i got a lot of 
my wife, our   
neither of her 
but they       
some of you    
maybe you      
maybe someone  
maybe you live 
but at the end 
that's no      
there is no    
where you are  
no one's       
you make your  
that's what    
young people   
jazmin didn't  
neither of her 
but she worked 
i'm thinking   
he's had to    
but he never   
he's headed to 
and then       
even when      
and jazmin,    
they face      
in some cases  
but they       
they chose to  
and i expect   
that's why     
your goal can  
maybe you'll   
maybe you'll   
maybe you'll   
and along      
but whatever   
i want you to  
i know that    
chances are    
the truth is,  
you won't love 
you won't      
not every      
and you won't  
some of the    
rowling's      
michael jordan 
he lost        
but he once    
and that's why 
these people   
you have to    
so if you get  
if you get a   
no one's born  
you become     
you're not a   
you don't hit  
you've got to  
the same       
you might have 
you might have 
you definitely 
don't be       
don't be       
i do that      
asking for     
so find an     
and even when  
the story of   
it's about     
it's the story 
students who   
who fought for 
students who   
so today, i    
what problems  
what           
what will a    
now, your      
i'm working    
but you've got 
so i expect    
i expect you   
i expect great 
so don't let   
don't let your 
most of all,   
make us all    
thank you very 
god bless      
your eminence, 
today we say   
the world will 
a champion for 
the soul of    
and the lion   
senate - a man 
but those of   
uncle teddy,   
i, like so     
ted kennedy    
the restless   
he was the     
when they      
when a         
this spirit of 
he lost two    
he saw two     
he said        
he narrowly    
it is a string 
and it would   
to surrender   
to retreat     
no one would   
but that was   
ndividual      
indeed, ted    
as tempted     
more able to   
as more        
thence, also,  
through his    
the young      
the citizen    
the landmark   
ted kennedy's  
it was to give 
to add a rung  
to make real   
he was given   
we can still   
and yet, while 
while he was   
he was a       
and that's how 
he did it by   
there was the  
the time he    
and the famous 
teddy walked   
when the       
when they      
before long,   
it was only a  
patrick's day, 
i gave him my  
but when the   
i looked at    
he just patted 
of course,     
a few years    
without        
but though it  
it was the     
it was the     
it was the man 
senator would  
i have one of  
by the way,    
and it seems   
ted kennedy    
he took them   
he laughed and 
cried and      
and passed on  
shortly after  
we are all     
not only did   
and especially 
after so much  
that he did is 
and she didn't 
as ted would   
she gave him   
joy and        
and stood by   
we cannot know 
we cannot      
we cannot know 
what we can do 
we can use     
we can learn   
and we can     
that we made a 
that our       
this is how    
this is his    
he once said   
the greatest   
we do not weep 
we weep        
not for wealth 
but only for   
in the days    
but he didn't  
he kept        
he fought      
he invited     
to one widow,  
as you know so 
ted kennedy    
at last he is  
white mane     
smiling        
may god bless

and with the   
there are      
raise your     
there's kellie 
kellie is a    
she used to    
but then she   
it's a telling 
even as this   
and joe and    
community      
this place can 
now, since     
5 million      
now, i   the   
the whole      
here in        
and new jobs   
now, that's    
those just     
those are      
if you haven't 
a family       
and you know   
that's part of 
we take pride  
people need    
and so when    
now, my        
and it's a job 
i love these   
my job is to   
so i welcome   
i want the     
and i know     
many           
their feeling  
i agree that   
but i also     
i thought      
so i said that 
now today,     
remember,      
they've gotten 
they've got a  
those          
workers and    
creditors and  
retirees and   
and together,  
it was the     
but even with  
they're the    
in some cases, 
and that only  
for even       
so now is the  
what we face   
this is a      
and in this    
it's not the   
that's what    
now is the     
to build that  
we're going to 
and don't be   
we have no     
we're going to 
but don't let  
now is the     
and jennifer   
she is bring   
i want         
so you can be  
you need to    
i know about   
but we also    
we've got to   
time and       
that's what    
that's what    
that was the   
and that's     
by 2020, this  
we used to     
we're going to 
and we've      
already we've  
we've created  
we've          
a new gi bill  
and the        
so we've       
but today i'm  
we're going to 
and it's       
it will reform 
through this   
not since the  
and let me be  
we pay for     
we're paying   
that will save 
instead of     
that's what my 
now, i know    
it's not, and  
i can't tell   
so i           
but we know    
we will not    
that's why i   
it's providing 
the rest of    
this is        
in fact, 59    
this is        
and this is    
many young     
and more       
at the same    
and this is in 
so community   
not only is    
that's why     
jill biden     
and that's why 
let me         
number one, we 
we'll fund     
we'll          
we'll put      
these are all  
we've seen     
we know that   
so we want to  
that way, when 
we'll also     
to measure     
all too often, 
and that means 
and schools    
and this is    
if a parent is 
they have to   
if a worker is 
in addition,   
see, more than 
that's not     
oftentimes     
and it's a     
so we'll fund  
let's figure   
maybe it       
maybe a young  
the point is,  
all right, so  
the second     
we're going to 
all too often, 
they're an     
and that means 
that's a       
through this   
and by the     
you also have  
so it means    
even as we     
so we're going 
and this will  
and this will  
we don't know  
so let me say  
the road to    
it was never   
when i was     
then we had    
now we've got  
we will get to 
and it's going 
there are      
but i am       
that's what    
we hit some    
that's what we 
that's what    
at every       
that's what we 
i am           
thank you very 
god bless the  
good morning,  
before i       
we are now     
over the last  
it's a plan    
let me repeat  
it is a plan   
even though we 
there are      
but health     
i know there   
but this is    
it's the kind  
it's the same  
and it is      
so make no     
the status quo 
if we step     
premiums will  
the insurance  
people will    
this is a      
this country   
we can't       
we can't       
and during the 
and i promised 
these are      
this is no     
this is about  
health care    
so i just want 
we are going   
inaction is    
and for those  
we are going   
and even those 
and so i       
the muscles in 
we are going   
and if there's 
regina         
the list of    
benjamin an    
she was in the 
she served as  
in 2002, she   
and she has    
it's very      
but of all     
well, tell me  
that's in      
bayou la batre 
it's a         
and by the     
benjamin,      
there are a    
and like so    
and that's     
when people    
when the       
when hurricane 
when hurricane 
she tended to  
and when       
with help from 
one disabled   
another        
for nearly two 
regina         
she's seen an  
she's been a   
and she's      
but for all    
those          
through floods 
her patients   
and when we    
the one thing  
somebody is    
and now we in  
we don't have  
all we have to 
and i know     
benjamin is    
and i am truly 
with that, let 
regina         
it is a great  
michelle and i 
and as         
i know that    
russian        
russian        
russian        
these are      
indeed,        
that includes  
we've been     
and as a       
, i continue   
we're very     
here at nes,   
as pushkin     
and today, i   
you're poised  
in finance and 
but before you 
like president 
but you are    
at that time,  
the            
competition in 
if one person  
and then,      
now, make no   
this change    
the cold war   
with the end   
for new        
like all       
but, of        
back in 1993,  
the real world 
the real world 
over two       
great wealth   
poverty exists 
more people    
ideological    
a human being  
in a new       
a few          
there were     
but the        
and despite    
we see that    
a place of     
above all, we  
your lifetime  
but think      
what kind of   
what kind of   
what world     
those          
you get to     
and while i    
to begin with, 
america wants  
this belief is 
despite our    
recently, i    
as president   
so as we honor 
think of the   
security from  
access to      
health and the 
an             
these          
yet            
a conception   
there is the   
and there is a 
these          
in 2009, a     
the days when  
as i said in   
the pursuit of 
that's why i   
this must be   
it must be a   
this will not  
it's difficult 
but i believe  
it is not for  
first, america 
in the last    
in 2009, our   
you and i      
but we do have 
we have to ask 
we have to ask 
this is the    
the notion     
in the short   
without a      
that's why     
that is        
that is our    
and while i    
we're already  
yesterday,     
we renewed our 
and we agreed  
as we keep our 
whether        
that's why we  
and i'm        
this is not    
if we fail to  
and that       
as i said in   
the successful 
i know russia  
and my         
and i've made  
it has nothing 
in fact, i     
but if the     
now, in        
for years, al  
indeed, above  
and these      
islamabad and  
and they have  
they're        
and that's why 
to disrupt,    
we seek no     
instead, we    
and that's why 
neither        
it's time to   
a future in    
now, beyond    
we are helping 
we're pursuing 
we're          
in each of     
now, in        
and since we   
we meet in the 
i believe that 
but wherever   
in america,    
but just as no 
you see,       
and while this 
think of       
a young woman  
an             
an nes         
that's good    
when new ideas 
when new       
there is       
we can pursue  
we can boost   
all of that,   
now,           
it's young     
and the        
that success   
as president   
people         
whether they   
and this       
by no means is 
but it is our  
freedom of     
the rule of    
independent    
competitive    
if our         
because at the 
but it is      
so around the  
the arc of     
governments    
governments    
governments    
and in our own 
now let me be  
america cannot 
and we haven't 
even as we     
we do so not   
we do so       
and that leads 
state          
just as all    
that is true   
any system     
that's why we  
america will   
for any        
they must      
they must be   
and let me be  
nato should be 
and more       
as president   
but no one     
that is        
that's why     
a system where 
a system where 
there was a    
those days are 
the world is   
billions of    
over the past  
we've seen old 
we've seen the 
now, we must   
that is        
i know that    
in the words   
but think of   
one hundred    
when i was     
when you were  
you get to     
you get to     
the future     
that is the    
and given all  
every country  
russia has cut 
as you move    
look to the    
together, we   
and it is all  
good luck to   
thank you very 
good           
today i want   
first, i'd     
the united     
i strongly     
i've made it   
but we must    
and we deplore 
the iranian    
some in iran   
these          
they're an     
this tired     
this is not    
this is about  
the iranian    
that's         
in 2009, no    
despite the    
this is what   
we've seen the 
we've seen     
above all,     
while this     
those who      
as i said in   
the iranian    
if the iranian 
it must govern 
that's what    
thank you so   
please,        
thank you very 
you're very    
let me begin   
i want to      
joseph heyman, 
jeremy         
thanks to all  
from the       
in recent      
we're here to  
we're stemming 
all this is    
but even as    
and we also    
and in order   
today, we are  
and yet, as i  
in fact,       
make no        
the cost of    
it's an        
it's a ticking 
and it is      
it's           
these are not  
stories like   
this is        
it's creating  
our costly     
small business 
they've always 
across the     
our largest    
a big part of  
if we do not   
when it comes  
so reform is   
it is a        
when i hear    
i know there's 
this is a test 
but let there  
if we fail to  
if we fail to  
and in 30      
and if we fail 
it will, in    
it's a         
so to say it   
it's a fact,   
and yet, as    
there's a      
there's a fear 
i'm here to    
and i          
they're scars  
after all,     
teddy          
harry truman   
richard nixon  
jimmy carter   
bill clinton   
but while      
part of the    
and if we're   
and despite    
one sign that  
it went        
now, what      
they're coming 
and i want to  
just a week    
and that will  
that will      
that's exactly 
now, the       
how do we      
that's what    
we know the    
we know this   
but we also    
who will give  
we have heard  
and because    
so let me      
i know that    
and that means 
if you like    
if you like    
no one will    
my view is     
fix what's     
and that's     
if we do that, 
a system that  
a system that  
that's how     
that's what we 
and that's     
now, the good  
first, we need 
and we've      
it simply      
as newt        
you shouldn't  
you shouldn't  
all that       
that's just    
and that will  
it will also   
it will tell   
it will        
it will reduce 
so there       
and we want to 
the second     
that starts    
it means       
it means going 
it means going 
it also means  
that's a       
as some of you 
i say we       
that's a       
building a     
it will take   
it will take   
if you're one  
and if you     
you get more   
it's a program 
and we're open 
our federal    
five of the    
and yet only a 
and that's     
but as         
they will only 
despite what   
demographics   
but what       
a system that  
now, a recent  
not because    
it's simply    
treatments     
and the        
one dartmouth  
there are two  
the first is a 
and a lot of   
it's a model   
that pushes    
it's a model   
that's not why 
that's not why 
that's not     
you didn't     
you entered    
and that's     
that's what    
now, that      
we need to     
we need to     
we need to     
and we need to 
that's why     
somebody back  
the second     
we have the    
yet we're not  
less than 1    
and even when  
as a result,   
a recent       
that means     
or placing a   
so one thing   
that's why     
now, let me be 
it's about     
see, i have    
i have         
we're not      
we just need   
still, even    
and that's why 
and places     
and places     
these are all  
so replicating 
but my         
i need your    
the fact is    
that's what we 
we listen to   
and that's why 
together, if   
we can save    
and when we    
now, i         
i recognize    
don't get too  
now, i         
that's a real  
now, just hold 
i want to be   
i'm not        
but i do think 
how to let     
how to         
i want to work 
so this is     
and i know,    
and i look     
and it's going 
but all this   
all of it's    
now, i know    
the changes    
because our    
that's why i'm 
in recent      
these          
and as we seek 
we must do so  
each time an   
it's a hidden  
and as we      
but alongside  
and it is      
we are not a   
we are not a   
we're a nation 
we look out    
that's what    
we need to get 
so we need to  
the first      
so just in     
if you like    
if anyone says 
now, if you    
this exchange  
you will have  
again, this is 
if you like    
nobody is      
but if you're  
and i believe  
now, i know    
even within    
in particular, 
and these are  
as i stated    
what we seek   
and the fact   
with reform,   
and i just     
and if you     
so the public  
it is your     
let me also    
there are      
but i believe  
so when you    
they're not    
what i am      
and to help    
that way,      
indeed, it's   
the same is    
while i        
and small      
now, here's    
insurance      
i welcome      
i'm glad       
but what i     
we're not      
let me give    
we need to end 
the days of    
i know you see 
this is        
i've told this 
i'll never     
changing the   
we need to put 
now, even if   
but it is a    
i've set down  
now, there are 
making health  
that's real    
but remember,  
and also       
that said, let 
first, as part 
over half of   
some are       
and the best   
but we can't   
we're also     
there are      
but here's     
first, we      
today, we're   
now, this is a 
it's a subsidy 
it's not a     
it's not a     
and by the     
that's why we  
that alone     
second, we     
right now,     
this puts      
it drives up   
by changing    
that will save 
third, we need 
these are      
but right now, 
creating such  
we can save    
so that's the  
i've also      
one way is by  
right now,     
these          
another way we 
i know         
but if we put  
reducing these 
and we'll make 
we can also    
and we can     
let me be      
i'm committed  
in fact, these 
and i'm        
now, for those 
so that stuff  
the            
we think       
in the weeks   
and let me add 
i just want to 
by insisting   
now, let me    
i know people  
i know there   
there's        
i also know    
we can't let   
you know, the  
one article    
another warns  
another asks   
it speaks to   
the thing is,  
members of the 
i don't want   
i don't want   
i want them to 
where families 
where parents  
where parents  
where patients 
where          
where what's   
that's the     
that's the     
and if we're   
thank you very 
appreciate it, 
thank you,     
thank you to   
thanks also to 
and to a world 
i'm not the    
this is an     
veterans and   
the liberated  
it's been      
and long after 
of all the     
what is it     
part of it, i  
for three      
and it had     
that was the   
from the tip   
low-lying      
sharpened      
mines were     
and by the     
at dawn on     
the best       
but all did    
paratroopers   
so when the    
many never     
and yet,       
they were      
soon, the      
the rangers    
and by the end 
the sheer      
it also arises 
we live in a   
it's a world   
in such a      
the second     
no man who     
but all know   
for what we    
it was a       
nazi ideology  
it perpetrated 
the nations    
they had made  
but whatever   
citizens of    
and so we      
in america, it 
a president    
on farms and   
trucks and     
bombers and    
shipyards on   
but despite    
lyndon johnson 
d-day was such 
one newspaper  
had the allies 
instead,       
it opened a    
it made        
the marshall   
it was         
more           
perhaps more   
you're why we  
for you remind 
you remind us  
our history    
it has always  
you could have 
in the face of 
amid a barrage 
you could have 
you could have 
but that's not 
that's not the 
your story was 
lost and       
it's a story   
he spent three 
and it's a     
private        
after wading   
and under the  
he carried     
this is the    
it's the       
it's the tale  
the canadians, 
the russians,  
and all those  
it is the      
for me, it is  
and it is my   
his name is    
i know this    
one such       
last night,    
jim was        
but just as he 
may he now     
in the end,    
he came for    
when asked why 
it doesn't     
so people      
friends and    
what we must   
at an hour of  
they fought    
and they       
that is the    
of the         
of the union   
of the men who 
of all the     
it's a story   
for as we face 
to those men   
may god bless  
chancellor     
i want to      
volkhard       
i am           
bertrand herz, 
we saw the     
in fact, at    
we saw the     
we saw the     
a reminder     
now these      
as we were     
and there's a  
more than half 
i will not     
i've known     
he was part of 
they liberated 
and i told     
and as we see  
my great       
he had seen    
that they      
and he knew    
and that's why 
he invited     
and he         
we are here    
to this day,   
this place is  
a reminder of  
also to this   
in this        
we've seen     
children used  
this places    
but as we      
for amidst the 
the jews who   
the camp cook  
the prisoners  
they set up    
and we were    
and so out of  
when the       
and i'm told   
among the      
whatever our   
in our blood   
these          
they could not 
15, the moment 
they could not 
and they could 
they could not 
but still      
in their       
and it is now  
it is up to us 
it is up to us 
to ensure that 
to remember    
and just as we 
and i want to  
rather than    
thank you so   
i am honored   
for over a     
and for over a 
and together,  
i'm grateful   
and i'm also   
assalaamu      
we meet at a   
the            
more recently, 
moreover, the  
violent        
the attacks of 
all this has   
so long as our 
and this cycle 
i've come here 
instead, they  
i do so        
i know there's 
but i am       
there must be  
as the holy    
that is what i 
now part of    
i'm a          
as a boy, i    
as a young     
as a student   
it was islam   
it was         
islamic        
timeless       
elegant        
and throughout 
i also know    
the first      
in signing the 
and since our  
they have      
they have      
they have      
they have      
they have      
they've        
they've won    
and when the   
so i have      
that           
and i consider 
but, that same 
just as        
the united     
we were born   
we were        
and we have    
we are shaped  
e pluribus     
now much has   
but my         
the dream of   
moreover,      
that is why    
that's why the 
so let there   
islam is a     
and i believe  
to get an      
to love our    
these things   
this is the    
of course,     
words alone    
these needs    
for we have    
when a new flu 
when one       
when violent   
when innocents 
that is what   
that is the    
and this is a  
for human      
yet in this    
given our      
so whatever we 
our problems   
our progress   
now, that does 
indeed, it     
we must face   
and so in that 
the first      
in ankara, i   
we will,       
the killing of 
and it is my   
the situation  
over seven     
we did not go  
we went        
i'm aware that 
but let us be  
al qaeda       
the victims    
and yet al     
they have      
these are not  
these are      
now, make no   
we do not want 
we see no      
it is          
it is costly   
we would       
but that is    
and that's why 
and despite    
indeed, none   
they have      
they have      
but more than  
their actions  
the qur'an     
and the holy   
the enduring   
islam is not   
now, we also   
that's why we  
5 billion      
that's why we  
8 billion      
let me also    
unlike         
although i     
indeed, we can 
i hope that    
today, america 
to help iraq   
and to leave   
and i have     
iraq's         
and that's why 
that is why we 
we will help   
but we will    
and finally,   
nine-eleven    
the fear and   
we are taking  
i have         
so america     
and we will do 
the sooner the 
the second     
america's      
this bond is   
it is based    
around the     
tomorrow, i    
six million    
denying that   
and it is      
threatening    
on the other   
for more than  
many wait in   
they endure    
so let there   
the situation  
and america    
for decades    
two peoples    
it's easy to   
but if we see  
the only       
that is in     
and that is    
the            
for peace to   
palestinians   
resistance     
for centuries, 
but it was not 
it was a       
this same      
from eastern   
it's a story   
violence is a  
it is a sign   
that's not how 
that's how it  
now is the     
the            
hamas does     
to play a role 
at the same    
the united     
this           
it is time for 
and israel     
just as it     
neither does   
progress in    
and finally,   
the            
instead, it    
america will   
we cannot      
but privately, 
likewise, many 
it is time for 
too many tears 
too much blood 
all of us have 
when the holy  
when jerusalem 
the third      
this issue has 
for many       
in the middle  
since the      
troops and     
this history   
rather than    
the question   
i recognize it 
there will be  
but it is      
this is not    
it's about     
i understand   
no single      
and that's why 
and any nation 
that           
and i am       
the fourth     
i know   i     
so let me be   
no system of   
that does not  
each nation    
america does   
but i do have  
the ability to 
confidence in  
government     
the freedom to 
these are not  
they are human 
and that is    
now, there is  
but this much  
governments    
suppressing    
america        
and we will    
this last      
once in power, 
so no matter   
you must       
you must       
you must place 
without these  
the fifth      
islam has a    
we see it in   
i saw it       
that is the    
people in      
this tolerance 
among some     
the richness   
and if we are  
freedom of     
we must always 
for instance,  
that's why i'm 
likewise, it   
we can't       
in fact, faith 
and that's why 
that's why we  
around the     
the sixth      
i know  i know 
i reject the   
and it is no   
now, let me be 
issues of      
in turkey,     
meanwhile, the 
i am convinced 
our common     
i do not       
but it should  
and that is    
finally, i     
i know that    
the internet   
trade can      
in all nations 
fear that      
but i also     
there need not 
countries like 
the same is    
in ancient     
and this is    
many gulf      
but all of us  
i'm            
and while      
on education,  
at the same    
and we will    
on economic    
and i will     
on science and 
we'll open     
today i'm      
and we will    
all these      
americans are  
community      
now the issues 
but we have a  
a world where  
a world where  
those are      
that is the    
but we can     
i know there   
some are eager 
some suggest   
many more are  
there's so     
but if we      
and i want to  
you, more than 
all of us      
the question   
it's easier to 
it's easier to 
it's easier to 
but we should  
there's one    
this truth     
that isn't     
that isn't     
it's a belief  
it's a faith   
we have the    
the holy       
we have        
and we have    
the talmud     
the whole of   
the holy bible 
blessed are    
the people of  
we know that   
now that must  
and may god's  
thank you very 
we meet today  
now, over the  
we're working  
we're          
and we're      
but none of    
without that   
it's long been 
but make no    
this world     
it's our       
it's the       
it's the       
so cyberspace  
and so are the 
it's the great 
and this       
it's about the 
we rely on the 
but we've had  
spyware and    
millions of    
according to   
i know how it  
it's no secret 
what isn't     
to all of you  
so your        
but between    
and we worked  
it was a       
in this        
this is a      
the small      
louis, the     
e-commerce     
but every day  
in one brazen  
a single       
it's been      
in short,      
and this is    
we count on    
we rely on     
yet we know    
our            
but our        
al qaeda and   
indeed, in     
in one of the  
and while no   
and last year  
as russian     
the terrorists 
for all these  
it's also      
in recent      
but just as we 
no single      
indeed, when   
we saw this in 
this status    
we can and we  
and that's why 
our review was 
i want to      
they listened  
industry and   
we listened to 
i consulted    
today i'm      
this new       
from now on,   
as a strategic 
protecting     
we will ensure 
we will deter, 
to give these  
because of the 
i'll depend on 
today, i want  
orchestrating  
working        
and, in the    
to ensure that 
to ensure that 
there's much   
first, working 
to ensure a    
to ensure      
clear          
and as we      
second, we     
given the      
nor is it      
just as we do  
third, we will 
the vast       
so let me be   
my             
on the         
fourth, we     
and that's why 
laying         
building a     
pursuing a     
and moving to  
and finally,   
and that's why 
because it's   
so these are   
let me also be 
our pursuit of 
we will        
indeed, i      
the task i     
5 billion      
groups and     
protecting our 
but we need to 
we're only at  
the epochs of  
the industrial 
by comparison, 
we're only at  
now our        
and we've only 
so a new world 
so long as i'm 
and the united 
thank you very 
good morning,  
please be      
thank you all  
let me just    
we've got our  
we have our    
we have our    
secretary      
attorney       
my national    
and i want to  
i also want to 
i want to      
thank you so   
these are      
we're          
we're fighting 
we face a      
so there's no  
and we've      
just this      
the   it's a   
the engines of 
i want to say  
in the midst   
it's the first 
it's the last  
and this       
we are less    
we know that   
we know that   
already, we've 
for the first  
we're          
we have        
and we've      
we're better   
we're building 
and we have    
these steps    
but i believe  
the documents  
they are the   
i stand here   
my father came 
my mother made 
my own         
i've studied   
i took an oath 
i make this    
we uphold our  
time and       
in times of    
fidelity to    
it's the       
it's the       
it's the       
from europe to 
that is who we 
and where      
after 9/11, we 
that our       
unfortunately, 
i believe that 
but i also     
that all too   
instead of     
and during     
in other       
and this is    
it was an      
now let me be  
we are indeed  
we do need to  
but we must do 
in checks and  
for reasons    
and that's why 
first, i       
i know some    
i could not    
as             
i bear the     
and i          
what's more,   
they alienate  
they serve as  
they risk the  
in short, they 
now, i should  
as senator     
and even under 
that's why we  
they are not   
the second     
for over seven 
during that    
let me repeat  
three          
instead of     
meanwhile,     
let me repeat  
two-thirds of  
there is also  
instead of     
in fact, part  
meanwhile,     
indeed, the    
so the record  
rather than    
it is a        
it sets back   
by any         
that's why i   
the third      
i knew when i  
there are 240  
in dealing     
we're cleaning 
indeed, the    
for example,   
the supreme    
in other       
the problem    
now let me be  
there are no   
i wish there   
but i can tell 
as president,  
i refuse to    
it is my       
our security   
our courts     
and neither    
now, over the  
i'm an elected 
i understand   
we're          
but i have no  
i'll leave     
i want to      
and we will be 
listening to   
words that     
so i want to   
i will explain 
and i'll focus 
first, issues  
but, second, i 
now, let me    
we are not     
where demanded 
as we make     
nobody has     
as republican  
we are         
and as we do   
that's why we  
instead we are 
now, going     
first,         
some have      
our courts and 
the record     
ramzi yousef   
he was         
zacarias       
he was         
if we can try  
recently, we   
we're          
preventing     
and after over 
the second     
military       
they are an    
they allow for 
they allow for 
and for the    
now, some have 
they should    
in 2006, i did 
i said at that 
those are the  
instead of     
we will no     
we will no     
and we will    
these reforms, 
the third      
now, let me    
this has       
it has to do   
the courts     
they have      
nineteen of    
i cannot       
the united     
the fourth     
so far, our    
and my         
now, finally,  
and i have to  
we're going to 
but even when  
examples of    
these are      
i am not going 
al qaeda       
having said    
they can't be  
that's why my  
we must have   
we must have   
we must have a 
i know that    
and other      
now, so must   
but i want to  
our goal is    
in our         
if and when we 
and so, going  
now, as our    
these are      
you can almost 
but if we      
and if we      
i have         
i am not the   
and together   
now, let me    
national       
one the one    
on the other   
in these and   
now, several   
i did not do   
i released the 
the argument   
we will not be 
that approach  
in short, i    
and the        
on the other   
personnel      
individuals    
there was and  
nothing has    
however, it    
troops with a  
in short,      
there are      
nothing would  
now, in the    
they are not   
in each of     
and this       
there's no     
in the images  
and whether it 
and that       
and that leads 
i understand   
i ran for      
and that's     
but i have     
i will never   
here's the     
whenever we    
we're          
because in our 
now, along     
this is a      
it's been used 
and while this 
it is also     
so let me lay  
we must not    
and that's why 
and we plan to 
we will apply  
we will not    
and each year  
on all these   
these often    
but the common 
we will        
i will never   
i will deal    
i will tell    
now, in all    
to protect the 
we are closing 
we are         
we are         
these are      
their          
there's a core 
even as we     
we seek the    
by doing that  
now, this is   
i recognize    
when it comes  
some americans 
others want to 
i know that    
i've opposed   
the congress   
the department 
it's no secret 
and it's no    
but nothing    
already, we've 
it can         
we see that,   
on the one     
and on the     
their          
both sides may 
the american   
they know that 
that, after    
that's the     
that has been  
that's what    
i can stand    
make no        
if we fail to  
and if we      
the framers    
but our        
it provides a  
it hasn't      
we are an      
every now and  
and we hear    
but over the   
and though     
now this       
and unlike the 
right now, in  
that will be   
neither i nor  
but i can say  
and i do know  
because the    
this must be   
i ran for      
we will not be 
we've done so  
we will do so  
thank you, god 
president      
thank you very 
thank you,     
please, have a 
well first of  
               
thank you so   
you are doing  
so, good       
i am honored   
i am grateful  
and i also     
i know it has  
i don't know   
so far i'm     
hesburgh is    
i guess that's 
so, father ted 
i also want to 
president      
and since      
president      
we're fine,    
we're   we're  
we want to     
now, since     
no, don't      
we all know    
now this       
i want to      
               
though i have  
so next year,  
now, every one 
one hundred    
some were here 
you, however,  
you have a     
your class has 
it's a         
this           
your           
your           
and we must    
in short, we   
and   and it's 
for the major  
they do not    
they do not    
they do not    
moreover, no   
our very       
unfortunately, 
king said, in  
and part of    
we too often   
we cling to    
too many of us 
the strong too 
and so for all 
we know these  
and hopefully  
you've grown   
and yet one of 
the soldier    
the gay        
those who      
the   the      
is it possible 
as citizens of 
how does each  
and of course, 
as i           
in a few days  
he described   
what bothered  
the doctor     
he supported   
he wrote, i do 
fair-minded    
after i read   
and i didn't   
and i said a   
because when   
that's when we 
so let us work 
let's reduce   
let's make     
let's   let's  
let's honor    
those are      
now,           
each side will 
but surely we  
fair-minded    
it's a way of  
you know,      
and i want to  
you are an     
now, this      
you see, i was 
and a group of 
and it was     
but all of us  
we were bound  
and something  
perhaps        
perhaps        
perhaps        
i was drawn to 
it was through 
and at the     
and for those  
i can still    
he stood as    
and yet, he    
and just       
and he said,   
my heart and   
they were      
and i'd like   
for this, i    
now, you,      
you'll be      
you'll be      
to give future 
and whether as 
you'll hear    
and you'll     
and you will   
occasionally,  
in fact, i     
and in this    
be unafraid to 
hold firm to   
in other       
but remember,  
remember, too, 
it's the       
it's beyond    
and those of   
and this doubt 
but it should  
it should      
it should      
and within our 
for if there   
it's no        
it is, of      
the call to    
the call to    
to do what we  
so many of you 
brennan is     
that's         
and now   now  
make it a way  
because when   
it breaks down 
it fosters     
and when that  
when they      
after all, i   
now, brown was 
but it would   
there were     
it was the 12  
there were six 
it included    
so they worked 
and finally    
and years      
and father ted 
and so he      
they fished,   
i will not     
it never has   
but as you     
remember that  
to understand  
remember that  
if nothing     
               
may god bless  
thank you,     
you know, i

to sara

wiesel   thank 
speaker nancy  
senator dick   
members of     
our good       
members of the 
and most       
it is a great  
we gather      
honor those    
it is the      
science that   
education that 
the            
while the      
the            
the            
the            
but while we   
in the moral   
7,200   the    
we remember    
we are awed by 
and your       
we can only    
we also        
not a single   
but it was not 
the author of  
how could you  
we were doing  
that is the    
they remind us 
they teach us  
their legacy   
and the        
how do we      
i believe we   
in the face of 
my own great   
he went up     
he was one of  
and so some of 
my great uncle 
and they       
the story goes 
and general    
he ordered     
and he ordered 
then he        
and he ordered 
some of us     
eisenhower     
eisenhower     
he understood  
what           
that's what    
that's what    
it's the very  
but we must    
we know that   
we've seen it  
to this day,   
who perpetrate 
today, and     
instead we     
to recognize   
to commit      
that is my     
i hope that is 
it will not be 
at times,      
but in the     
of the nation  
of the strong  
it is the      
i'm thinking   
what a         
to believe     
we find cause  
in hutus and   
in a movement  
those numbers  
that is what   
so today,      
and may we     
thank you, god 
well, to       
we're going to 
he's a pretty  
to mayor       
to             
to georgetown  
well, it is    
i appeared in  
we're going to 
and i was      
you know, it's 
and i think    
in just under  
and i know     
others believe 
and many       
so today, i    
this is going  
i want to talk 
i want to      
most of all, i 
a future where 
that's the     
that's the     
that is the    
now, to        
recessions are 
markets and    
but this       
this recession 
it was caused  
as has been    
during the     
instead of     
others were    
the reason     
investment     
and credit     
no one really  
but since the  
banks took on  
the            
aig, the       
everybody was  
and as the     
then the       
home prices    
people began   
and the value  
banks and      
greed gave way 
investors      
large          
other banks    
now, this is   
after all, the 
it's how       
so when banks  
when laid-off  
when people    
when people    
because the    
and when other 
so this is the 
so our most    
and since the  
the first step 
so the federal 
my             
it's a plan    
5 million jobs 
it's putting   
and to cushion 
now, you will  
so i want to   
to begin with, 
you see, when  
and so have    
and this is a  
but if         
that's why the 
that's exactly 
second, i      
but the fact   
as i'll        
so the         
the second     
the heart of   
in a climate   
it's for this  
now, i         
that's the     
ideally, these 
but where      
of course,     
on the one     
but whether we 
and although   
and i          
it makes sense 
so that's a    
that's why we  
now, on the    
this is        
and the        
so let me be   
the reason we  
it's certainly 
rather, it's   
governments    
first, do no   
so rest        
to that end,   
now, what      
aig, for       
and that's     
it's also why  
this is also   
to do this,    
and to         
in a few       
late last      
unfortunately, 
and by the     
now, it is our 
in the         
and we will    
finally, to    
each nation    
all agreed to  
we also agreed 
that's not     
because        
we pledged to  
and we decided 
so that's      
all of these   
they've been   
and taken      
because of our 
clean energy   
our housing    
our program to 
and small      
now, this is   
it does not    
2009 will      
the severity   
the market     
credit is      
the process    
we are not     
and all of     
but all of     
but even as we 
even as we     
it is simply   
it is not      
it's not       
that's just    
for even as    
the crushing   
the failure of 
the progress   
the growing    
even after we  
so we've got a 
now, there's a 
the first      
but the second 
for it was     
it was founded 
we cannot      
we must build  
we must lay a  
where we       
it's a         
number one,    
number two,    
number three,  
number four,   
and number     
that's the new 
that's our     
that must be   
let me talk    
the first step 
it is time to  
just as after  
create rules   
rules that tie 
rules that     
so we've       
the second     
you know, in   
bill helped    
for decades we 
but in this    
that's why we  
by 2020,       
that is the    
to meet that   
so we've       
we are         
we're creating 
and i've asked 
and, by the    
for so long,   
and that's     
but you know   
now, the third 
we all know    
yet we've      
i don't know   
i think it's   
so the         
and we are     
now, the only  
there are      
and they are   
transitioning  
but we can no  
that needs to  
if businesses  
and pretty     
investors will 
that's how we  
now, the       
one and a half 
major american 
small          
we can't allow 
and that's why 
that's why     
and included   
so i'm looking 
we can get     
now, fixing    
it's not going 
but in my      
in fact, we've 
already we've  
we need to do  
we've          
we need to do  
secretary      
we need to do  
we will end    
altogether,    
and as we      
that's what    
of course, i   
i know there's 
you've heard   
well, let me   
first, as i    
so as serious  
and that's     
second, in     
that's the     
well, you're   
you're         
look, just as  
if we don't    
if we don't    
and i can      
that's the     
third point,   
it has been    
this           
but let's not  
that's just    
along with     
so if we want  
now, nothing   
so make no     
that's not     
and that's one 
once we tackle 
it's time for  
and we should  
all of these   
all these      
but the        
i've talked a  
but we also    
for too long,  
there's been a 
there's also   
when a crisis  
this can't be  
the challenges 
the stakes are 
i know how     
i'd love if    
it's more than 
but we have    
and that       
there is no    
by no means    
but from where 
and beyond     
it's an        
that is the    
and we will    
we will not    
but if we use  
god bless the  
thank you,     
let me say     
thanks to all  
listen, i am   
president      
i love you     
i am honored   
and i'm not    
and i've been  
but there's a  
number one,    
you know, when 
and what i     
you have       
under enormous 
and because of 
that is an     
that's point   
point number   
i was just     
it is time for 
they need to   
and in order   
they're going  
they are going 
all those      
we can't do it 
but what we    
and so just as 
so now is not  
we have to be  
the last point 
you've been    
you've seen    
there are      
there are many 
and so i want  
the federal    
we are going   
the main point 
so thank you   
god bless the  
speaker, madam 
this is my     
i've been to   
some people    
and my answer  
turkey is a    
turkey is an   
and turkey and 
this morning i 
and i was      
but it is also 
his greatest   
this future    
at the end of  
but turkey     
you freed      
and there is a 
turkey's       
it was not     
turkey draws   
now, my        
the general    
and like you,  
i can see the  
it took        
there were     
over time,     
among those    
and one of     
ottoman sultan 
inscribed in   
so as to       
over 150 years 
our nations    
but our        
it is a        
turkish troops 
together, we   
trade between  
so has         
the ties among 
and as a       
the united     
but we have    
and because of 
now, our two   
an economic    
extremism that 
strains on our 
the            
and the        
these are the  
and the        
by poverty or  
by strife or   
this much is   
no one nation  
that is why we 
that is why we 
we are         
that is the    
that is the    
that will be   
already,       
now, this past 
to reject the  
and to         
as we go       
the president  
there's        
and we can     
we should      
and to power   
this economic  
so in meeting  
so let me be   
the united     
we speak not   
turkey has     
turkey is      
centuries of   
europe gains   
and turkish    
now, of        
and you've     
but i also     
in the last    
you've         
you've lifted  
these          
for            
freedom of     
an enduring    
robust         
i say this as  
but it is      
every          
this work is   
that's why, in 
that's why we  
all of us have 
and sometimes  
another issue  
the united     
facing the     
our country    
human endeavor 
history is     
each country   
and reckoning  
i know there's 
and while      
and the best   
we've already  
these contacts 
an open border 
so i want you  
it is a cause  
it speaks to   
and to advance 
advancing      
and here       
the two        
the united     
these efforts  
and when we    
in the middle  
let me be      
the united     
that is a goal 
that is a goal 
that is a goal 
we know the    
both israelis  
both israelis  
both must      
the united     
like the       
and like the   
so now,        
we must pursue 
we must extend 
we must reject 
the peace of   
now, as i made 
you live in a  
this part of   
it has known   
it does not    
now, i have    
we want iran   
iran is a      
we want them   
but iran's     
so both turkey 
i know there   
there were     
but now we     
as i've        
and we will    
make no        
iraq, turkey,  
that includes  
that includes  
there is no    
as president,  
these efforts  
finally, we    
the world has  
that's why we  
that is why we 
that's why we  
turkey has     
your troops    
you have       
now we must    
i appreciate   
together, we   
i know there   
i know that    
so let me say  
the united     
in fact, our   
i also want to 
we seek        
we will listen 
we will be     
we will convey 
the united     
many other     
i know,        
above all,     
i want to help 
we want to     
we want to     
in the months  
our focus will 
and when       
there's an old 
you cannot put 
america knows  
turkey knows   
there's some   
but force      
the future     
that is the    
i know there   
they see your  
they know that 
they wonder    
but i believe  
turkey's       
this is not    
in the beauty  
in the         
in the         
in your hopes  
i am honored   
thank you very 
thank you so   
thank you for  
thank you to   
thank you to   
today, i'm     
and, to        
prime          
and to the     
i've learned   
behind me is a 
in 1918, after 
i don't think  
for over a     
you've known   
you've seen    
you've led     
through it     
and this city  
when i was     
few people     
few people     
few would have 
those ideas    
we are here    
we're here     
we are here    
we are here    
sametová       
it showed us   
it showed us   
and it proved  
that's why i'm 
they believed  
that peace     
we are here    
now, we share  
but now this   
we, too, have  
as the world   
and we've seen 
none of these  
but all of     
that we focus  
and that we    
that is the    
that is the    
to renew our   
that means     
that means     
that means a   
and we have an 
now, to        
together, we   
and i pledge   
to provide for 
nato was       
that was when  
so we came     
and we should  
this marks the 
and i know     
great powers   
i am here to   
we are bound   
nato's article 
an attack on   
that is a      
the people of  
thousands were 
nato's mission 
we are         
we are         
and i want you 
but no         
we must work   
we must        
and we must    
now, one of    
the existence  
no nuclear war 
cities like    
today, the     
in a strange   
more nations   
testing has    
black market   
the technology 
terrorists are 
our efforts to 
now,           
one nuclear    
and no matter  
some argue     
such fatalism  
just as we     
and as nuclear 
we cannot      
so today, i    
this goal will 
it will take   
but now we,    
we have to     
now, let me    
first, the     
to put an end  
make no        
as long as     
but we will    
to reduce our  
president      
and this will  
to achieve a   
ratification   
after more     
and to cut off 
if we are      
that's the     
second,        
the basic      
countries with 
to strengthen  
we need more   
we need real   
and we should  
that must be   
and no         
we must        
but we go      
some countries 
that's why we  
just this      
north korea    
this           
security       
rules must be  
violations     
words must     
the world must 
now is the     
all nations    
and that's why 
iran has yet   
my             
we believe in  
but in that    
we want iran   
we will        
that's a path  
or the         
so let me be   
iran's nuclear 
the czech      
as long as the 
if the iranian 
so, finally,   
this is the    
one terrorist  
al qaeda has   
and we know    
to protect our 
so today i am  
we will set    
we must also   
because this   
and we should  
now, i know    
there are      
and there are  
but make no    
we know where  
when nations   
when we fail   
we know the    
to denounce or 
that's how     
that's where   
there is       
we must        
i know that a  
but that is    
those are the  
those are the  
those were the 
those were the 
human destiny  
and here in    
let us bridge  
together we    
thank you very 
thank you,     
thank you so   
it is a great  
i want to make 
i want to      
i want to      
they just      
i want to      
vincent        
and i want to  
it is          
you know,      
but before i   
the            
strasbourg has 
over thousands 
two rivers are 
two religions  
three          
you served as  
so it's        
we've known    
of new         
but the same   
even with the  
and this       
we also know   
the terrorists 
and the        
the economic   
not more than  
today what's   
now, there's   
but every      
the one way    
that is the    
now, we take   
now, today in  
now, we take   
the buildings  
they were born 
men and women  
europeans and  
it was 61      
amid the ashes 
one year       
an attack on   
without firing 
it would lead  
two decades    
at the         
this           
we cannot be   
we must learn  
we must renew  
we must seek   
this is our    
this is our    
and i am       
such an effort 
it's always    
it's more      
so we must be  
in recent      
i know that    
in america,    
instead of     
but in europe, 
instead of     
on both sides  
they are not   
they do not    
they threaten  
they fail to   
so i've come   
together, we   
so let me say  
america is     
we are         
the only way   
over the last  
the g20 summit 
all of us are  
all of us have 
no one is      
no more will   
those days are 
we are         
as we take     
that trade     
we can't give  
we cannot      
we can't       
i know it can  
and that's why 
all of us must 
so it's not    
it's a matter  
and as we      
as we meet     
now, i         
our allies     
you've sent    
and i also     
what does this 
what's its     
understand we  
as president,  
so i           
there's doubt  
the united     
we were        
along the      
and they're    
so i've made a 
we do this     
to root out    
we have no     
we have more   
but this is a  
that's what we 
and now we     
that's why we  
that's why we  
and that is    
this is one of 
and we also    
this is the    
the effects of 
europe has     
and in the     
we appointed a 
but we all     
and that means 
europe must do 
china and      
rolling back   
so let us meet 
i am confident 
but we have to 
and let us     
it's perhaps   
but just       
it does not    
and to that    
i've sent a    
and it is in   
we seek only   
we cannot      
we have to     
with every     
we can't get   
as it was in   
we know that   
we know this

america's men

those          
let me say     
by august 31,  
as we carry    
we will

but our        
this plan      
after we       
as i have long 
training,      
conducting     
and protecting 
initially,     
through this   
and under the  
troops from    
we will        
as we          
sustained      
the drawdown   
the long-term  
iraq is a      
america cannot 
however, a     
this effort    
from his time  
he will be     
going forward, 
we will work   
we can serve   
and just as we 
diplomacy and  
these men,     
america has a  
in the coming  
we'll          
and we will    
now, before i  
you are a      
you are joined 
in years past, 
through        
and instead of 
our nations    
but ours is a  
we americans   
to root out    
and to seek    
there are      
they represent 
america, too,  
we endured the 
but hostility  
they offer no  
and they must  
so to the      
the united     
we respect     
we seek a full 
and going      
that leads me  
the future of  
it is time for 
and going      
this reflects  
we can no      
that is why we 
that is why we 
developing a   
and actively   
and that is    
every nation   
and that era   
finally, i     
you make up a  
and for you    
it lives on in 
it endures in  
you and your   
that is why i  
and that is    
we will        
post-traumatic 
we also know   
in her visits  
i want you to  
military       
we'll raise    
we will also   
as a nation,   
it has, at     
to this very   
but there      
and so i want  
we sent our    
we kept our    
and we will    
that is the    
there are many 
we have        
we have        
we have        
we have        
and we have    
the starting   
i know that    
and as long as 
that is the    
you know       
you have lived 
and we all     
semper fidelis 
these young    
they came      
and last       
in an age when 
these two      
these two      
and these two  
when the       
jonathan was   
in the town    
one marine who 
we flew here   
we wouldn't be 
america's time 
their names    
they are       
they are       
they live on   
each american  
each of you    
and that story 
from the       
you teach us   
your sacrifice 
there will be  
we will face   
but thanks to  
thank you, god 
madame         
vice           
i have come    
i know that    
if you haven't 
a member of    
you don't need 
it's the worry 
it's the job   
the business   
the college    
the impact of  
but while our  
though we are  
we will        
the weight of  
the answers to 
they exist in  
in our fields  
in the         
those          
what is        
now, if we're  
i say this not 
the fact is,   
nor did all of 
we have known  
yet we import  
the cost of    
our children   
and though all 
in other       
where we       
a surplus      
regulations    
people bought  
and all the    
well that day  
now is the     
now is the     
that is what   
it's an agenda 
as soon as i   
not because i  
not because    
i called for   
in fact, a     
that's why i   
and tonight, i 
over the next  
more than 90%  
constructing   
laying         
because of     
health care    
there are 57   
because of     
because of     
and americans  
i know there   
i understand   
here in        
and with a     
that is why i  
i have told    
i have         
and we have    
gov so that    
so the         
but it is just 
because even   
i want to      
you should     
your insurance 
and you can    
that is not    
the concern is 
you see, the   
the ability to 
how stores     
but credit has 
too many bad   
with so much   
when there is  
so businesses  
our economy    
that is why    
we will do so  
first, we are  
second, we     
it's a plan    
in fact, the   
third, we will 
and when we    
i understand   
but such an    
and our goal   
i intend to    
this time,     
those days are 
still, this    
but while the  
that would be  
and i refuse   
i understand   
so were the    
so i know how  
i promise you  
but i also     
my job – our   
our job is to  
i will not     
that's what    
it's not about 
because when   
and then some  
and then those 
investors will 
slowly, but    
so i ask this  
because we     
and to ensure  
it is time to  
the recovery   
but the only   
the only way   
the schools    
that is our    
in the next    
so often, we   
i see this     
i see it as a  
my budget does 
it reflects    
given these    
and that       
but that does  
i reject the   
that says      
for history    
history        
in the midst   
from the       
in the wake of 
and a twilight 
in each case,  
it catalyzed   
it created the 
we are a       
now we must be 
that is why,   
energy, health 
it begins with 
we know the    
and yet, it is 
we invented    
new plug-in    
well i do not  
it is time for 
thanks to our  
we have also   
we will soon   
and we will    
but to truly   
so i ask this  
and to support 
advanced       
as for our     
we should not, 
but we are     
millions of    
scores of      
and i believe  
none of this   
but this is    
we don't do    
we do what is  
for that same  
this is a cost 
by the end of  
5 million      
in the last    
and in each of 
it is one of   
and it's one   
given these    
already, we    
when it was    
our recovery   
it will launch 
and it makes   
this budget    
it includes an 
it's a         
and it's a     
now, there     
i suffer no    
it will be     
but i also     
so let there   
health care    
the third      
in a global    
right now,     
and yet, just  
we have one of 
and half of    
this is a      
that is why it 
already, we    
we have        
we have made   
and we have    
but we know    
they need more 
that is why    
pathways for   
we'll invest   
and we will    
it is our      
but it is the  
and so         
this can be    
vocational     
but whatever   
and dropping   
it's not just  
that is why we 
by 2020,       
i know that    
and to         
these          
but it is up   
in the end,    
i speak to you 
there is, of   
and that is    
with the       
i'm proud that 
yesterday, i   
my             
as you can     
but we're      
we have        
in this        
we'll          
we will root   
in order to    
but let me     
if your family 
not one single 
in fact, the   
and these      
to preserve    
comprehensive  
and we must    
finally,       
that is why    
for seven      
no longer will 
we are now     
and with our   
because i will 
as we meet     
to each and    
we honor your  
to relieve the 
and to keep    
to overcome    
that is why i  
and that is    
in words and   
for we know    
we cannot shun 
we are instead 
to seek        
to meet the    
from pandemic  
and to respond 
for the world  
as we stand at 
waiting for us 
those of us    
it is a        
for in our     
i know that it 
consumed with  
but in my      
that           
i think about  
he didn't tell 
i didn't feel  
i think about  
the tragedy    
but the folks  
and i think    
she has been   
she even asked 
the letter     
we are not     
we are not     
these words    
they tell us   
a willingness  
their resolve  
their concerns 
and we must    
i know that we 
but i also     
that must be   
that is the    
and if we do – 
if we put our  
if we confront 
thank you, god 
pease, be      
thank you,     
madam speaker, 
it is a great  
as we mark the 
it is fitting  
built by       
it was         
and it was in  
what those     
the laborers   
whether the    
but each day   
and when       
that is as it  
the american   
the people's   
that even when 
and that on    
it is this     
and while      
in the war's   
with victory   
he could have  
but despite    
they were to   
what lincoln   
he was even    
that was the   
it was the     
what lincoln   
and so even as 
that is the    
thank you,     
the economic   
it's a crisis  
a crisis       
6 million jobs 
we know that   
but make no    
a failure to   
millions more  
more           
more dreams    
and that's why 
with it, we    
it's not       
now, in the    
that we can    
that we can    
i reject those 
and so did the 
so i urge      
no plan is     
no one is more 
but let's not  
let's show     
at the same    
we also need a 
and my         
our recovery   
and so in the  
but in order   
in order to    
we all need to 
and this       
as i said last 
and that's     
a culture of   
this is        
we don't       
we don't       
and we         
but what gets  
taxpayers,     
for top        
we're going to 
as part of the 
taxpayers will 
and if these   
companies      
and we're      
we're taking   
we're asking   
we believe     
and finally,   
we're going to 
we're going to 
we all have to 
that's true    
that's true on 
the american   
bearing the    
the american   
thank you very 
we begin this  
just this      
our economy    
and we could   
in short, if   
that is why i  
i am pleased   
it's a plan    
that's why     
it's one that  
health care    
today i'd like 
to accelerate  
we'll begin to 
we'll save     
5 million      
to lower       
and we'll      
to ensure our  
we'll invest   
finally, we    
that means     
it means       
and it means   
i know that    
i understand   
we won't just  
instead of     
we'll launch   
no one policy  
but if we act  
if we start    
if we act as   
thanks for     
my fellow      
i stand here   
i thank        
forty-four     
the words have 
yet, every so  
at these       
so it must be  
that we are in 
our nation is  
our economy is 
homes have     
businesses     
our health     
our schools    
and each day   
these are the  
less           
today i say to 
they are       
they will not  
but know this, 
they will be   
on this day,   
on this day,   
we remain a    
2 the time has 
to choose our  
to carry       
the god-given  
in reaffirming 
it must be     
our journey    
it has not     
rather, it has 
for us, they   
for us, they   
endured the    
for us, they   
normandy and   
time and again 
they saw       
greater than   
this is the    
we remain the  
our workers    
our minds are  
our capacity   
but our time   
starting       
for everywhere 
the state of   
we will build  
we will        
we will        
and we will    
all this we    
all this we    
now, there are 
their memories 
for they have  
what free men  
what the       
the question   
where the      
where the      
and those of   
nor is the     
its power to   
the nation     
the success of 
on the ability 
as for our     
our founding   
those ideals   
and so to all  
know that      
and we are     
recall that    
they           
instead, they  
our security   
we are the     
guided by      
we will begin  
with old       
we will not    
you cannot     
for we know    
we are a       
we are shaped  
and because we 
that the lines 
that as the    
and that       
to the muslim  
to those       
to those   to  
but that we    
to the people  
to nourish     
and to those   
nor can we     
for the world  
as we consider 
they have      
we honor them  
a willingness  
and yet, at    
for as much as 
it is the      
it is the      
our challenges 
the            
but those      
these things   
they have been 
what is        
what is        
this is the    
this is the    
this is the    
so let us mark 
in the year of 
the capitol    
the enemy was  
the snow was   
at a moment    
let it be told 
that in the    
that the city  
in the face of 
with hope and  
let it be said 
and with eyes  
thank you, god 
i want to      
i want to      
welcome to     
in the course  
our nation is  
our economy is 
millions of    
they're        
and most of    
i won't        
it will take   
along the way  
but despite    
what gives me  
for in these   
rising before  
on the ground  
directly in    
and behind me, 
and yet, as i  
it is you      
it's the same  
a belief that  
latino, asian  
black and      
this is what i 
you proved     
and as i       
who ask only   
it is this     
that runs      
that connects  
it is how this 
that is the    
there is no    
but never      
i ask you to   
thank you,     
let me begin   
throughout     
and then there 
this is one of 
we start 2009  
nearly two     
and on friday, 
just in the    
8 million      
manufacturing  
many           
many families  
many workers   
and many, many 
now, i don't   
if nothing is  
the            
our economy    
we could lose  
and our nation 
in short, a    
this crisis    
and we won't   
we arrived at  
for years, too 
banks made     
politicians    
the result has 
now, the very  
our problems   
it will take   
we can restore 
we should      
our            
we are still   
and we are     
if we act with 
that is why i  
it's a plan    
for if we hope 
it's time to   
it's time to   
there is no    
it will        
but equally    
it is true     
but at this    
only           
that's why we  
that's why we  
that's why we  
now this plan  
it's not just  
it's a plan    
the fact that  
and that's why 
that's why the 
to finally     
we will        
in the         
to improve the 
this will cut  
but it just    
it will save   
to give our    
we'll provide  
to build an    
yes, we'll put 
but we'll also 
that means     
it means       
it means       
and finally,   
to get people  
to help        
government at  
now i          
our government 
and that's why 
we'll invest   
the true test  
instead of     
every american 
and as i       
we have to

and that's     
let me just go 
number one, i  
number two, i  
they deserve a 
number three,  
and, finally,  
they should    
now, this last 
this is not a  
if this is     
and if we fall 
now, let me    
democrats and  
some of my     
i understand   
i also know    
but it's clear 
it is          
it's   there

during the     
there is an    
confidence and

in europe, the 
in america,    
both views     
that europeans 
and that just

no doubt,      
but the        
a change of

but the task   
true           
they require   
of peace and   
they require   
that is why    
that is why    
america has no

it was this    
and this is    
this is the    
this threat is 
if we could    
in london and  
in washington  
if we could    
this is the    
no one

to stop the    
and to reduce  
this is the    
this is the    
in this        
in this

and despite    
this   this is 
let us resolve

this   this is 
this is the    
and this is    
we must        
sixty years    
instead they   
and in that    
they won       
love and       
now the world  
will we extend 
will we lift   
will we stand  
will we give   
will we        
will we reject 
will we   will 
people of      
this is our    
i know my      
at times,      
we've made our 
but i also     
i know that    
to seek, with  
our allegiance 
every culture  
every point of 
what has       
that we can    
that we can    
these are the  
these          
it is because  
it is because  
it is in       
people of      
the road ahead 
but i come     
we are a       
with an eye    
thank you,     
sixty-one      
much of europe 
the united     
this menace    
the soviet     
the challenge  
leaders like   
we needed a    
such a         
it would shape 
through        
it would       
open markets   
it would       
it was a       
as a general,  
but the        
in the speech  
the whole      
to make that   
he closed by   
what can best  
what must be   
what can best  
what must be   
today's        
the power to   
the future of  
from the cave- 
the attacks of 
on that bright 
but the depth  
at blood banks 
in schools and 
the world,     
it was time    
it was time to 
imagine, for a 
we could have  
we could have  
we could have  
we could have  
we could have  
we could have  
we could have  
we could have  
instead, we    
our men and    
what's missing 
this war       
this war       
by any         
i am running   
instead of     
instead of     
instead of     
as president,  
i will focus   
ending the war 
finishing the  
securing all   
achieving true 
and rebuilding 
my opponent in 
we both want   
but we've made 
that starts    
i opposed      
senator mccain 
i warned that  
senator mccain 
those were the 
now, all of us 
what can best  
what must be   
senator mccain 
i want to      
it has been 18 
as i have said 
general        
we have talked 
shiite         
those are the  
for weeks,     
but this       
in the 18      
that's over    
that is a      
in the 18      
june was our   
the taliban    
al qaida has a 
that is a      
in the 18      
they have not  
they have not  
that's why i   
now, prime     
forces         
it comes at a  
now is the     
george bush    
they said we   
they refuse to 
theirs is an   
at some point, 
iraq is not    
we are not     
that is why    
in fact, true  
true success   
that is an     
to achieve     
ending this    
let me be      
we must be as  
we can safely  
that would be  
two years from 
after this     
targeting any  
protecting our 
and training   
we will make   
as i have      
we will        
we will commit 
we will forge  
and we will    
this is the    
this is the    
and this is    
both america   
both america   
and this is    
we cannot      
i will restore 
so let's be    
senator mccain 
i want iraqis  
that's what's  
in fact   as   
that's why the 
it is          
osama bin      
the taliban    
al qaida has   
if another     
and yet today, 
senator mccain 
i could not    
our troops and 
that's what    
and that's     
this is a war  
i will send at 
i will focus   
just as we     
moreover,      
that's why     
as a part of   
we cannot lose 
the afghan     
the greatest   
we cannot      
we need a      
we need more   
and we must    
make no        
we can't       
we must expect 
it's time to   
that's why i'm 
we must move   
only a strong  
one of the     
but the fact   
in those years 
now, we worry  
now, we worry  
now, we worry  
terrorists who 
we cannot wait 
i've made this 
i'll lead a    
and i'll       
beyond taking  
america seeks  
as long as     
but instead of 
and russian    
to             
to seek a      
and to expand  
-russian ban   
by keeping our 
in particular, 
we cannot      
preventing     
no tool of     
i will use all 
there will be  
i commend the  
ultimately the 
that's why we  
we will pursue 
instead, we    
if you abandon 
if you refuse, 
stronger       
that's the     
and the        
by waiting,    
the surest way 
that will      
ending the     
one of the     
we ship nearly 
it pays for    
it funds       
it takes       
this immediate 
that means     
africa, the    
most           
this is not    
for the sake   
and as         
small steps    
i'll invest    
this fund will 
we'll invest   
and from the   
never again    
i will reach   
we will also   
we'll set a    
and as we      
that is the    
and that will  
for all of our 
we faced down  
we stood       
we helped      
now is the     
it's time for  
it's time to   
it's time to   
it's time to   
it's time to   
it's time to   
and just as we 
that's why     
that's why     
that's why     
that's what we 
we will have   
i know         
that was true  
that's why     
to halve       
to send once   
your future is 
and our moment 
this must be   
for eight      
that divides   
that focuses   
we cannot      
none of this   
when general   
but marshall   
he had the     
today, the     
now, the       
we know what   
we know what   
we know what

john mccain

she needs us   
that's the     
maybe   maybe  
that man needs 
that's the     
and maybe if

that we owe it 
and recruit an 
and finally    
that's the     
that's why i'm 
now   now, the 
that is a      
it is a debate 
but what you   
what you won't 
what you won't 
we are always  
despite        
i've walked    
i've sat       
i've worked    
in our country 
and every so   
so it was for  
so it was for  
so it was for  
so it has been 
and so it must 
america, this  
this is our    
the journey    
the road will  
i face this    
because if we  
this was the   
this was the   
this was the   
thank you,     
god bless the  
thank you so   
thank you so   
let me begin   
in so many     
and so we are  
and i'm        
we the people, 
two hundred    
farmers and    
the document   
it was stained 
of course, the 
a constitution 
and yet words  
what would be  
this was one   
to continue    
i chose to run 
that we may    
towards a      
and this       
but it also    
i'm the son of 
i was raised   
i've gone to   
i am married   
i have         
and for as     
it's a story   
but it is a    
now throughout 
despite the    
in south       
this is not to 
at various     
we saw racial  
the press has  
and yet, it's  
on one end of  
that it's      
on the other   
now i've       
for some,      
did i know him 
did i ever     
did i strongly 
absolutely,    
but the        
they weren't   
instead, they  
a view that    
as such,       
racially       
two wars, a    
given my       
why associate  
why not join   
and i confess  
but the truth  
the man i met  
he is a man    
in my first    
people began   
and in that    
at the foot of 
those stories  
the blood that 
the tears our  
until this     
our trials and 
in chronicling 
that has been  
like other     
like other     
they are full  
the church     
and this helps 
as imperfect   
he strengthens 
not once in my 
he contains    
i can no more  
i can no more  
these people   
and they are   
now, some will 
i can assure   
and i suppose  
we can dismiss 
but race is an 
we would be    
to simplify    
the fact is    
and if we walk 
understanding  
as william     
in fact, it    
we do not need 
but we do need 
segregated     
we still       
and the        
legalized      
that history   
a lack of      
and the lack   
this is the    
they came of   
what's         
but for all    
that legacy of 
even for those 
for the men    
that anger may 
at times, that 
and            
the fact that  
that   that    
indeed, all    
it keeps us    
it prevents    
but the anger  
it is          
in fact, a     
most working   
their          
as far as      
they built it  
they've worked 
they are       
and in an era  
so when they   
like the anger 
but they have  
anger over     
politicians    
talk show      
and just as    
a corporate    
a washington   
economic       
and yet, to    
this is where  
it's a racial  
and contrary   
but i have     
for the        
it means       
but it also    
and it means   
they must      
ironically,    
but what my    
the profound   
it's that he   
what we know,  
that is true   
what we have   
now, in the    
that the       
not just with  
by enforcing   
by providing   
it requires    
in the end,    
that we do     
let us be our  
let us be our  
let us find    
for we have a  
we can accept  
we can tackle  
or in the wake 
or as fodder   
we can play    
we can pounce  
or we can      
but if we do,  
and nothing    
that is one    
or, at this    
this time we   
this time we   
that those     
the children   
this time we   
this time we   
this time we   
it's that the  
this time      
we want to     
and we want to 
i would not be 
this union may 
and today,     
there's one    
king's         
there's a      
she'd been     
and ashley     
and because    
they had to    
she knew that  
that's the     
she did this   
and so ashley  
now, ashley    
perhaps        
she sought out 
anyway, ashley 
they all have  
many bring up  
and finally    
and ashley     
and he doesn't 
he does not    
he does not    
he does not    
he simply says 
i'm here       
now, by        
it is not      
but it is      
it is where    
and as so many 
thank you very 
thank you,     
thank you to   
thank you to   
thank you to   
you know, over 
but there were 
well, tonight  
after four     
you can see it 
there are      
they are black 
they are       
and we've got  
and in nine    
we are hungry  
but if there's 
now, partly    
but there are  
we are looking 
we're looking  
it's a status  
and right now  
so this will   
make no        
we're up       
but we know    
we're up       
but we know    
we're up       
it's the kind  
that's the     
it is bad for  
and this is    
we're up       
but we know    
this is why    
this is why    
and this       
but let me say 
what we've     
it's a         
we are here    
i did not      
i saw south    
we're also     
the change we  
and so this is 
so let me      
change will    
there will be  
but as hard as 
they can't     
they can't     
theirs are the 
she needs us   
that's what    
the teacher    
the maytag     
that woman who 
so understand  
the choice in  
it's not about 
this election  
it's about     
there are      
but here's     
i know that    
01   along     
so don't tell  
that woman     
when i hear    
so don't tell  
when i hear    
don't tell me  
yes, we can    
yes, we can    
yes, we can    
and as we      
thank you,     
scripture      
the walls of   
they were too  
and so, the    
but god had a  
he told them   
and, at the    
that's what    
and there are  
as i was       
because before 
and on the eve 
unity, he      
unity is the   
unity is how   
king           
but maybe if a 
if just a few  
if teenagers   
maybe if white 
unity is the   
it is the      
i'm not        
i'm not        
talking about  
i'm talking    
king, we are   
we have an     
we have a      
we have a      
we have a      
we have an     
we have a      
so, we have a  
we have walls, 
however, all   
we've come to  
that it's just 
all too often, 
we offer       
of course,     
it starts with 
it starts with 
it's not easy  
it's not easy  
we've all      
what makes it  
we are told    
the welfare    
the immigrant, 
the believer   
and for most   
and all of us  
and yet, if we 
if we're       
if we're       
the scourge of 
for too long,  
everyday our   
it is played   
it is          
last week, it  
none of our    
so let us say  
the divisions, 
we can no      
we can no      
it's the       
king could     
but if         
it's not       
it's not       
it's not       
scripture      
and if we are  
we can't pass  
that is not a  
we can't       
king's dream,  
that is what   
changes that   
they will not  
all of us will 
none of us     
we've had to   
that, too, is  
we will have   
that's how     
king led this  
he did it with 
he led with    
he also led by 
he led by      
he led by      
he led by      
king           
that's the     
that is the    
you know       
you know they  
some have been 
they say, ah,  
he's so        
he's a hope    
i talk about   
i talk about   
you know my    
i needed some  
i was raised   
i needed some  
i got in       
i needed some  
i wasn't born  
i was given    
that's what i  
that's my      
so i talk      
i   i put hope 
it doesn't     
folks don't    
say, you know, 
i spoke about  
i   i wrote a  
and so i   so  
they say i'm   
get a reality  
and i have to  
the            
your   your    
that you must  
that seems to  
and so i have  
hope is not    
hope is not    
hope's just    
i know how     
the insurance  
i know it      
i know that    
i know because 
i have fought  
i've seen good 
i've seen this 
i know how     
i know how     
everybody here 
but i also     
that's how     
nobody was

that's how a   
that's how the 
that's how     
that's how     
that's how     
they marched,  
that's what    
imagining and  
there's        
there are no   
i don't        
imagine if     
kennedy had    
false hopes,   
king had stood 
we can't       
there's no     
change does    
it happens     
it happens     
it's because   
it wasn't just 
all the voices 
that's what    
not just those 
the stories    
when i think   
king, i        
not by getting 
but coming     
those who      
that's where   
he saw god in  
those stories  
they happen in 
they happen in 
so, let me     
there is a     
ashley has     
she's in       
she's been     
set up a round 
and so, ashley 
and she        
and she lost   
and then she   
they were on   
they didn't    
ashley lived   
and so ashley  
she had heard  
and she   she  
so she did     
and in that    
she had heard  
she thought,   
and if he      
that's what    
so ashley      
they all have  
some bring up  
some talk      
some talk      
some are       
some just like 
so they all    
he's been      
and ashley     
and he doesn't 
he does not    
he doesn't     
he doesn't say 
he doesn't say 
he simply says 
i am here      
and that       
now, by        
by itself,     
it's why i     
and if they    
and if enough  
the walls of   
that is our    
ebenezer, we   
brothers and   
in the

i, as well,    
president, the 
last week, a   
other attacks  
on sunday, a   
and the road

the insurgents 
they hide in   
they've shot   
helicopters in 
more of our    
president, it  
the american   
they've seen   
they've spent  
the failure    
that's not     
it's been a    
and it's time  
there is no    
president, to  
and it's time  
the news from  
we all wish

at this point, 
the iraqi      
if they want   
our failed     
credibility

this is what   
we're saying   
even if this   
i'm glad to    
and i want to  
he took the    
the decision   
it's a measure 
they've        
the decision   
forces to      
and coalition  
and that is a  
president      
by maintaining 
i should also  
our military   
it's time to   
president,     
while i prefer 
policy in iraq 
an end to the  
peace with     
it comes when  
the decisions  
we have a      
we can         
the road won't 
president,     
but this       
the president  
the president  
but he is now  
president, the 
let this day   
let this be    
president, let 
i yield the    
giving all     
i must begin   
so i'm going   
please give a  
it is a great  
reverend       
to the family  
e, to the good 
i want to      
i'm thankful   
to all the     
i was          
vivian in the  
and i'm a      
but i'm hoping 
you know,      
where abraham  
and i stood    
and there were 
and i          
but i got a    
in cleveland,  
but i got a    
and he said,   
so i just want 
we're in the   
that battled   
like moses,    
there were     
vivian,        
thank god,     
and so because 
they led a     
they took them 
they wandered  
and it's       
it's because   
it is because  
it is because  
it is because  
i was          
my very        
i mentioned at 
i'm not sure   
and i tried to 
you see, my    
grew up in a   
and that's     
they called    
they wouldn't  
he had to      
they could     
they could     
yet something  
something      
something      
when men who   
that sent a    
his son, who   
what happened  
it worried     
how are we     
if right here  
so the         
we're going to 
this young man 
he met this    
but she had a  
there was      
so they got    
so don't tell  
don't tell me  
i'm here       
i'm here       
i stand on the 
i thank the    
but we've got  
as great as    
god told him   
you'll be at   
what i've      
you will see   
we're going to 
there are      
some rivers    
like moses,    
that doesn't   
the previous   
they took us   
we still got   
so the         
what do we do  
to fulfill the 
now, i don't   
i think that   
the first is   
john lewis     
but i worry    
we             
king's         
moses told the 
don't forget   
i worry        
thinks it      
thinks that    
and i think    
there's        
materialism    
you have to    
you have to    
you've got to  
and if we know 
second thing   
it is not a    
i was          
that they have 
i had a school 
and the reason 
at a time when 
and the        
and it reminds 
it has gotten  
and we should  
but we         
that until we  
third thing    
we've got 46   
it makes no    
as a           
life           
almost every   
the health     
blacks are     
we have        
we have fewer  
we got in some 
that's called  
you've got a   
you've got     
i went down to 
it still looks 
still not      
when 9/11      
they waived    
when hurricane 
new orleans    
there is an    
there is a gap 
it's not a gap 
but somehow    
and here is    
a hope gap     
so the         
are we doing   
are we         
and that, if   
are we making  
government     
it's the       
that brings me 
one of the     
imagine young  
i can't say    
bishop,        
i'm fighting   
with the       
that's not the 
but i'll tell  
we've got to   
that is part   
we got power   
folks are      
i'm in         
i see what's   
i see those    
we understand  
i also know    
that's what    
take off your  
put on your    
go do some     
change this    
that's what we 
we have too    
don't think    
i know         
those of you   
i went through 
i know what it 
don't tell me  
that comes     
we've got to   
it was also a  
sometimes it's 
reverend, it

i can't go to  
i can't start  
i can't run    
i can't run

when you see   
towards them,  
when they come 
when you see   
be strong and  
we've come a   
we traveled    
it's not how   
that bridge

but let me     
as most of you 
i   i moved to 
i was a young  
i knew no one  
but a group of 
and i accepted 
that i might   
my work took   
i joined with  
i saw that the 
it was in      
after three    
i became a     
it was with    
it   it was    
i made lasting 
it was here    
that it's      
and that so    
that's why we  
that's why we  
that's why we  
and that's why 
it was here,   
and that is    
now   now,     
thank you,     
recognize that 
i know that i  
but i've been  
the genius of  
and we should  
in the face of 
in the face of 
in the face of 
we welcomed    
we opened      
we landed a    
and we heard a 
we've done     
each and every 
today we are   
for that is    
that's what    
he had his     
he had his     
he had his     
he had his     
but through    
it's because

we've heard    
we've talked   
what's stopped

for the past   
we've been     
we've been     
we've been     
and when all   
we're          
and as people  
the cynics,    
they write the 
they get the   
they think     
the time for   
it's time to   
look, look, we 
i was proud to 
but washington

but let's also 
we can do      
but all of     
most of you    
i thought it   
today we       
america, it is

this campaign  
it will take   
this campaign  
by ourselves,  
divided, we    
but the life   
he tells us    
he tells us    
that beneath   
he tells us    
as lincoln     
of strange,    
that is our    
that is why i  
i want   i     
i want to win  
i want us to   
and if you     
if you sense,  
together we    
thank you very 
as many of you 
running for    
i certainly    
but as i've    
so i've spent  
the decisions  
our economy is 
many of you    
our continued  
and we're      
but            
it's the       
america's      
but today, our 
politics has   
and that's     
we have to     
this won't     
a change in    
years ago, as  
so even in the 
and that's why 
for the next   
and on         
in the         
and i look     
thank you lee, 
you have been  
let me also    
i have made my 
it is time for 
it is time for 
thanks to the  
bin ladin      
it came during 
but despite    
the extremism, 
then, one      
i was driving  
a plane had    
by the time i  
people         
we feared for  
we mourned the 
back at my law 
a plane        
men and women  
tall towers    
it seemed all  
what we saw    
and what we    
the history of 
and so a war   
an attack on   
an iron        
after 9/11,    
to devise new  
americans were 
friends around 
we had the     
the tide of    
but then       
we did not     
we did not     
we did not     
instead, we    
patriotism as  
the diplomacy  
a rigid 20th   
a deliberate   
and so, a      
i did not      
i was a strong 
but i said i   
i worried      
occupation of  
i pleaded that 
the political  
the president  
there was just 
nine days      
congress       
with that      
and we went    
because of a   
according to   
iraqis a       
afghanistan is 
al qaeda has a 
israel is      
iranis now     
groups         
six years      
what's more,   
what could     
a tragedy that 
it is time to  
it is time to  
just because   
the terrorists 
the threat is  
3 billion      
they distort   
they kill man, 
christian and  
they seek to   
to defeat this 
the president  
he elevates al 
he lumps       
al qaeda and   
he confuses    
and worse – he 
bin ladin and  
but they can   
a misguided    
by refusing to 
occupation of  
it is time to  
when i am      
getting out of 
developing the 
engaging the   
restoring our  
and securing a 
the first step 
i introduced a 
if the         
there is no    
only iraq's    
we must apply  
and we must    
in ending the  
that is why my 
but we must    
on the         
ending the war 
it will also   
our troops     
as a result,   
as president,  
as we step up  
we must also   
and nato       
we must not,   
the solution   
as president,  
these          
and we must    
above all, i   
we will not    
as 9/11 showed 
and today,     
al qaeda       
the taliban    
this is the    
there are      
there are      
there are      
it's a tough   
but that is no 
there must be  
we cannot fail 
as president,  
military aid   
pakistanmust   
i understand   
but let me     
there are      
they are       
it was a       
if we have     
and pakistan   
as the         
we must        
and we must    
               
so the second  
i will not     
this requires  
i will ensure  
we need to     
this must      
to succeed, we 
the finest     
but it cannot  
as president,  
i will         
we can't just  
we need to     
one component  
these teams    
where people   
i will also    
this is about  
we need        
but we must    
this cannot    
al qaeda and   
the united     
this is not    
it is about    
as president,  
this program   
and this       
we must also   
we know al     
we know they   
yet there is   
there are      
that is why i  
that is why i  
nuclear        
and that is    
while we work  
and i won't    
the lesson of  
go down the    
we haven't     
we haven't     
we tried not   
it's time to   
it's time to   
president      
let us never   
only by        
as president,  
i will do the  
they will no   
they will have 
no support for 
but america    
that is why    
when you       
so you look    
you see        
al qaeda's new 
many come from 
and it makes   
when those     
we know where  
in conflict    
in weak states 
from africato  
countries      
the extremists 
and we know    
america is     
they say we    
that is the    
and often he   
a sense of     
maybe an       
a mission and  
we know we are 
america is at  
we are not at  
americais a    
the vast       
3 billion      
but too often  
when i am      
we will author 
we do need to  
but democracy  
americamust    
that child     
as president,  
freedom must   
i will never   
i will focus   
freedom must   
so i will make 
i will double  
and i will     
we must work   
and as we lead 
i will also    
we will open   
add to our     
through a new  
as president,  
in the first   
i will make    
i will speak   
you matter to  
your future is 
and our moment 
this brings me 
i will make    
major general  
it included    
after abu      
you have no    
how can this   
this was not   
as the         
but because    
because the    
when i am      
america is the 
i also will    
there has been 
it was for a   
the sentence   
there has not  
i have faith   
as president,  
our            
this           
i will provide 
that means no  
no more        
no more        
no more        
that is not    
and it is not  
the fisa court 
the separation 
our            
we will again  
this           
there are no   
too often this 
a department   
that's not     
my             
i will         
and i will     
we have to put 
that means     
improving our  
and making     
we also have   
folks across   
on 9/11, it    
when i have    
information    
i will         
i will address 
and my         
we've been     
we've been     
i will ensure  
but this       
it can't just  
it's about the 
we are in the  
yet since      
we can't vote  
we can't reach 
we can't       
we can't get   
that is not    
theamerica i   
it's the       
that defeated  
it's a country 
that's the     
we just have   
if we do, we   
we can hold    
and we can be  
the relentless 
to make this   
it's going to  
it's going to  
that is a      
because when   
president, i   
i want to      
we owe a great 
and we owe     
without their  
i want to      
at a time when 
nobody can     
look at the    
only two years 
soon after,    
look at the    
there are      
since 2001,    
in fact, most  
but to me, the 
and on march   
now, i've      
king called a  
and i wonder   
you know, when 
but the most   
they marched   
they crossed   
they awakened  
and not five   
it was         
now, in 2006   
and he was     
there were     
unfortunately, 
of the 1100    
over half have 
so despite the 
now, there are 
these          
but let's      
and you can't  
and while      
it's not an    
a              
citizens who   
they also feel 
these          
our            
we have to     
we've seen     
and            
the help       
but we've got  
we need to     
we need to     
we need to     
and we need to 
we need to     
you know, in   
these hired    
in lake        
in wisconsin,  
if you've      
if you violate 
now, think     
we've got a    
this occasion  
but it's also  
as congressman 
it's clear     
5,6 now, the   
since that     
and those of   
we need to     
in other       
you know, two  
king spoke,    
the arc of the 
that's because 
it's because   
that's why i   
i would not be 
i hope we      
i yield the    
thank you very 
today, we      
and when i     
it didn't      
she earned a   
and one day    
and he told    
and she        
over the next  
she raised a   
and one of     
with no time   
she spent the  
you know, i    
king, and the  
she was an     
we sat and     
we   she       
king and the   
and then she   
she said her   
when you are   
that was her   
coretta scott  
she certainly  
she was joined 
my thoughts,   
and i ask that 
thank you very 
you know, four 
terrorists     
we all agree   
and we all     
americans      
but soon after 
that it didn't 
now, in        
either we      
i would        
president,     
it asks too    
that's why, as 
what we have   
several weeks  
the judiciary  
senate managed 
unfortunately, 
instead, we've 
this is        
when national  
all that is    
once a         
even though    
if you do      
you will have  
think about    
you want to    
this is        
there is no    
i see no       
and if someone 
no judge will  
no jury will   
this is just   
and there are  
giving law     
but doing it   
now,           
that is not a  
we can do      
we've got time 
it doesn't     
i believe we   
we don't have  
we can have    
now, there     
i support      
president, i   
i yield the    
good morning   
               
thank you      
president, for 
it was only a  
had i known it 
you know, it   
i recognize    
maybe we'll    
a little       
change your    
it has been a  
each time i    
but there have 
for example, i 
now, keep in   
i was proud    
so i'm 99th in 
it's my first  
senator obama, 
i did what you 
i said, place  
i thought he   
at that point, 
but as i was   
what will be   
in other eras, 
as a servant   
as a peasant   
as a subject   
and then       
a place where  
and as people  
across oceans  
louis,         
this           
and yet, brick 
it's answered  
have we failed 
will you       
you surely     
but the test   
the true test  
whether we     
whether chance 
we have faced  
at the end of  
do we do       
or do we try   
we chose to    
when the       
do we follow   
we chose to    
when world war 
do we listen   
or, did we     
again, we      
today, at the  
but this time, 
here in        
all of you,    
it's already   
but what       
i saw it       
when i met the 
it's as if     
and, in        
it started     
when was the   
then it        
as tom         
so that while  
now business   
countries like 
they           
they can       
the one        
so they        
china is       
not only are   
today,         
when you lose  
even the       
as prime       
if you've got  
if not, the    
so what do we  
how does       
what will our  
like so much   
once again,    
that the best  
in washington, 
but in our     
it's a         
it allows us   
it allows us   
it let's us    
and it is      
but there is a 
it ignores our 
it ignores the 
it's been the  
our economic   
it depended on 
but it has     
that's what's  
and so if we   
fewer kids     
more companies 
and those      
so today i'm   
this is not us 
it's not how   
america is a   
it is this     
and it is      
instead of     
what if we     
if we made     
if we walked   
what if no     
what if        
right now, all 
if we          
ten or twenty  
down the       
and across the 
the new jobs   
all of that is 
every one of   
we will have   
our children   
we'll have to  
republicans    
it won't be    
it can be our  
we have the    
but now we     
we need a      
and we need    
now, no one    
if you want,   
there is no    
no one is      
you can take   
but i hope you 
focusing your  
it asks too    
you need to    
not because    
not because    
it's primarily 
because        
because it's   
and i know     
they seem so   
but we know it 
because where  
nearly two     
in the         
and yet, year  
but its people 
one by one,    
this           
but they would 
one man from   
and here in    
here in        
and when their 
think about    
if they were   
it would have  
to go live     
and yet, they  
because they   
that we were   
the same       
the same       
because they   
today, on this 
my hope for    
you will be    
you won't      
but know that  
that           
and that       
thank you so   
thank you very 
ladies and

you know,

it was a       
and her name   
and yet, over  
and so the     
i am           
i also believe 
i think, as    
and i think    
i was not in   
and i think    
i would        
there is no    
this is        
we have        
what we've     
i would

and we were    
and i am       
an ancient     
a fundamental  
and despite    
instead of     
instead of     
and the world  
instead of     
instead of     
it's the       
it's the       
he said that,  
and instead of 
and a thriving 
this year, as  
india has      
india has      
now, just as   
in the decades 
yet, too       
those days are 
here in india, 
and in the     
so since that  
how can we     
that's what i  
how we can     
not just for   
of course,     
but i stand    
the united     
we seek        
we seek        
and we seek a  
now, to        
and a central  
now, india is  
but            
for we are two 
we are two     
and we are two 
and that's why 
since taking   
i was proud to 
for the first  
now, let me    
the united     
together with  
we've          
we valued      
we salute      
and we welcome 
in short, with 
and i believe  
first, as      
together, we   
with my visit, 
this will help 
we need to     
so we've       
and we'll work 
both of these  
we can pursue  
give india     
meet the       
and show the   
and together,  
the united     
and by opening 
as g20         
and we can     
together, we   
cooperation    
today, india   
and the united 
now, as        
together,      
we aim to help 
and as part of 
and this is an 
it's another   
because the    
and because    
as we work to  
in mumbai, i   
and here in    
this is the    
it's why we    
it's why we're 
and it's why,  
we will not    
america's      
we're making   
and while i    
the united     
our strategy   
and that's why 
the pakistani  
they've        
and we'll      
we must also   
in pursuit of  
more broadly,  
today, the     
deepening      
and we're      
like your      
as two global  
indeed, the    
that is why i  
now, let me    
the united     
these are the  
and so we look 
that           
that we        
this includes  
since i took   
we have put    
together, the  
we can make it 
and together,  
and this leads 
in the united  
here in india, 
your landmark  
voters can get 
and you're     
now, in a new  
and in another 
we're going to 
likewise, when 
thousands of   
hundreds of    
millions of    
there's        
there is so    
and that, too, 
as the world's 
indians know   
before he ever 
just as        
and along with 
and this, too, 
now, we all    
no one nation  
but when       
for it is      
it is          
it is          
faced with     
and if i can   
but speaking   
it's not       
it is staying  
it is giving   
and it         
so promoting   
and as global  
ultimately,    
ultimately,    
so i want to   
in your lives, 
in just        
you are now    
your parents   
your children  
but only this  
as you carry   
the united     
we will be     
because we     
we believe     
we believe     
ambedkar could 
we believe     
and we believe 
it's a simple  
and it's the   
that one is    
but to the     
this is the    
this is the    
and it can be  
and if we let  
so, thank you, 
and long live  
               
it is a great  
we know this   
each of us     
but there are  
we meet within 
and we meet    
outside the    
nine years     
two years ago  
these separate 
men and women  
from jalalabad 
the global     
underneath     
that ancient   
that a world   
these are some 
and today, i'd 
what our       
and what kind  
let me begin   
i have had no  
and in an age  
so america has 
we are         
and we made    
there is much  
the global     
we have        
but we cannot  
as for our     
since i took   
we have done   
we are now     
while drawing  
in             
and from south 
as we pursue   
earlier this   
we have joined 
we have        
and here, at   
as part of our 
i also said    
and that is    
iran is the    
security       
now let me be  
the united     
but the        
as we combat   
after making   
we are keenly  
and going      
america has    
since the      
and when the   
today, we      
family who     
amidst this    
last year, i   
we have        
but this       
now i          
the cynics say 
rejectionists  
some say that  
the potential  
and that after 
i hear those   
but i ask you  
if an          
israelis will  
the hard       
more blood     
this holy land 
i refuse to    
and we all     
each of us     
of course,     
earlier this   
prime minister 
and president  
these words    
but the road   
we know that   
israel's       
and our        
we believe     
we also        
now is the     
now is the     
now is the     
now, peace     
those of us    
and those of   
i know many in 
but these      
those who have 
and those who  
those who long 
after          
after 60 years 
israel is a    
it should be   
and efforts to 
the slaughter  
and make no    
the courage of 
the conflict   
and we can     
we can read    
we can table   
we can further 
and we can     
or, we can say 
this time, we  
this time, we  
this time we   
if we do, when 
it is our      
and there is   
indeed, after  
but even as we 
what is the    
and that is    
one of the     
that           
the idea is a  
and for the    
as robert      
so we stand up 
but we also    
human rights   
tyranny is     
in times of    
today, as in   
we see leaders 
we see         
we see         
we see         
as i said last 
yet experience 
that the       
to put it      
and i believe  
america is     
all of us want 
but that       
that means     
and that means 
yesterday, i   
america will   
and together,  
there is no    
there is no    
the same holds 
the arc of     
we have seen   
civil society  
and we will    
we will        
we will        
and it is time 
open society   
there is no    
now, make no   
the ultimate   
it will come   
there is no    
later this     
and i will     
i'll continue  
i'll join the  
and i will     
each of these  
and even as    
the common     
and the        
in all parts   
and now, we    
and when we    
to fight       
to energize    
to leverage    
this           
it's time to   
women to       
it's time for  
it's time to   
peacekeeping,  
and it's time  
the world that 
for human      
in particular, 
from eastern   
don't stand    
recall your    
because part   
that belief    
it is a belief 
conflict or    
so even as we  
a future where 
a world where  
a future where 
this future    
it will not    
but the        
remember, in   
it falls to us 
and though we  
that we need   
for through    
thank you very 
secretary      
most of all,   
to the         
for our        
we gather to   
we gather      
we gather in a 
and we gather  
on this day,   
it's tempting  
yet these      
they were      
brothers and   
sons and       
they were      
some never saw 
others saw the 
they were      
they were      
and they were  
nine years     
in that time,  
and though it  
our            
as a nation,   
how do we      
we need not    
the            
they attacked  
and so the     
to renew our   
to say that we 
they doubted   
today, in      
we will do     
they may seek  
we do not      
on a day when  
they may seek  
they may wish  
for scripture  
they may seek  
it was not a   
and just as we 
we champion    
those who      
today we       
as americans,  
for our cause  
our spirit is  
our resolve is 
like           
on this day    
this is how we 
this is how we 
this is how we 
this is how we 
may god bless  
tonight, i'd   
i know this    
we've now been 
we've endured  
and sometimes  
but this       
it should also 
from this      
much has       
a war to       
terrorism and  
thousands of   
tens of        
our relations  
our unity at   
these are the  
yet there has  
at every turn, 
as             
and like all   
the americans  
they defeated  
together with  
they shifted   
because of our 
so tonight, i  
operation      
this was my    
last february, 
that's what    
we've removed  
troops from    
we've closed   
and we have    
this completes 
troops pulled  
even as iraq   
and iraqi      
this year also 
a caretaker    
tonight, i     
and when that  
the iraqi      
our combat     
going forward, 
troops will    
advising and   
consistent     
troops will    
as our         
that's a       
this new       
of course,     
extremists     
but            
iraqis are a   
they have      
they           
only iraqis    
what america   
ending this    
the united     
we have sent   
we've          
through this   
now, it's time 
as we do, i'm  
here, too,     
this           
it's well      
yet no one can 
as i've said,  
and all of us  
the greatness  
and no         
americans      
now, as we     
but we must    
as we speak,   
we will        
and because of 
in fact, over  
within         
as with the    
but, as was    
that's why     
and next       
the pace of    
but make no    
this           
indeed, one of 
we must use    
and we must    
today, old     
new markets    
a new push for 
billions of    
as the leader  
now, that      
throughout our 
but we have    
and the        
unfortunately, 
we spent a     
this, in turn, 
for too long,  
as a result,   
and so at this 
they have met  
now, it's our  
now, it's our  
our most       
to strengthen  
we must        
we must        
this will be   
but in the     
part of that   
as long as i   
this is a      
that's why     
we're treating 
and we're      
just as the gi 
because part   
two weeks ago, 
thousands of   
over seven     
it was just a  
of course, the 
some were      
many have      
most           
as one staff   
those          
along with     
5 million      
they stared    
in an age      
every american 
from iwo jima  
from khe sanh  
our troops are 
and though our 
may god bless  
and may god    
well, welcome  
to you, to     
i want to

and these      
they remind us 
these events   
our founders   
in the         
the first      
and that right 
indeed, over   
and it is a    
now, that's    
recently,      
now, we must   
the 9/11       
and the pain   
so i           
and ground     
but let me be  
as a citizen,  
and that       
this is        
and our        
the principle  
the writ of    
we must never  
and let us     
our enemies    
al qaeda's     
these are not  
in fact, al    
so that's who  
and the reason 
the democracy  
the freedoms   
the laws that  
our capacity   
in my          
we are a       
we are shaped  
and that       
this is not    
past eras have 
but time and   
so it must be  
and tonight,   
and ramadan is 
the first      
like so many   
they became    
they helped    
they helped to 
they founded   
they built

today, our     
they excel in

i would be     
it wouldn't    
passing this   
to get there,  
so the members 
and i also     
we're grateful 
and the        
good to see    
now, let's put 
the fact is,   
there are a    
this reform    
it is designed 
it demands     
it provides    
and unless     
now, for all   
if you've ever 
what often     
that's what    
that's what    
both are here  
well, with     
and we'll      
with this law, 
we'll make     
with this law, 
and with this  
so, all told,  
and these      
looking out    
and that's not 
that's good    
because reform 
and it will    
now, beyond    
it will        
shareholders   
and finally,   
there will be  
if a large     
and there will 
that's what    
now, it        
for these new  
we may need to 
no law can     
it's still     
the fact is    
wall street    
they provide   
they back      
that's why     
we all win     
we all win     
we all win     
and we all win 
in the end,    
and that's     
because that's 
this is the    
ultimately,    
we rise or     
so these       
and that's why 
thank you very 
to mona and    
to senator     
senator        
to his larger  
may we all     
the time of my 
i have fought  
it's           
years from     
determined to  
he was a       
he was a party 
he was an      
and he was my  
that's how     
today we       
born cornelius 
corny, he      
from the aunt  
and there he   
unable to      
returning home 
before long,   
               
nearly 19,000  
not a single   
transplanted   
his heart      
making life    
giving you     
hope in the    
hope in the    
hope through   
his early      
when his bus   
and he said,   
and the        
it's a life    
of course,     
and so he      
we know there  
i remember     
he said, there 
you may know   
and i said,    
that's why we  
and as i       
like the       
over his       
i, too, read   
i was scared   
but as i soon  
it reflected a 
our way of     
precisely      
considering    
and there is a 
and even if he 
so that even   
robert byrd    
may god bless  
may he be      
and may his    
thank you very 
everyone       
thank you very 
let   let me   
we are blessed 
i want to      
acknowledge my 
all the        
to all the     
i want to      
some may       
teddy's not    
i was a        
that after     
we could       
i believed     
and that's     
we launched    
we have        
we're on the   
and we're      
so, despite    
and while this 
immigration    
in recent      
some have      
others have    
and            
of course, the 
on the one     
indeed, it is  
the scientific 
steel and      
all this was   
and then there 
the millions   
so this steady 
and it's       
to this day,   
folks travel   
immigration    
and in an      
just a few     
and one        
when she       
today, she     
this past      
even though    
one of them    
and she said,  
these women,   
it's a matter  
it's a matter  
that's what    
that's what    
anybody can    
now, we can't  
each new wave  
our founding   
but the ink on 
a century ago, 
chinese        
they didn't    
so the         
and that       
and it's made  
to begin with, 
obviously, the 
in fact,       
the result is  
the            
many settle in 
they work      
but because    
crimes go      
and this makes 
and billions   
more           
indeed, after  
backlogs and   
while an       
high fees and  
and while we   
instead of     
in sum, the    
and everybody  
unfortunately, 
just a few     
under the      
but that       
and now, under 
into this      
given the      
but it is also 
and it's not   
laws like      
it puts        
it makes it    
and you don't  
you can speak  
these laws     
and as other   
our task then  
and that means 
for example,   
and often this 
why should we  
i recognize    
it would       
and this could 
and it would   
ultimately,    
and no matter  
now, if the    
they know it's 
such an effort 
moreover, it   
many have      
some are       
migrant        
so even if it  
now, once we   
such an        
government has 
that's why i   
today, we have 
let me repeat  
we have more   
we doubled the 
we tripled the 
for the first  
and as a       
contrary to    
and statistics 
so the bottom  
the southern   
that doesn't   
we have to do  
even as we are 
but our        
our borders    
that's why     
we've already  
and we're      
but we need to 
we cannot      
it breeds      
it punishes    
and            
finally, we    
they must be   
they should be 
they must get  
being a        
we can create  
now, stopping  
we've begun to 
that's just    
people can now 
we've improved 
and we've      
but here, too, 
we should make 
our laws       
we need to     
and we should  
the dream act  
senator   and  
so these are   
the question   
last summer, i 
i was pleased  
i've spoken    
and i've       
and i've met   
who understand 
so we've made  
i'm ready to   
the majority   
and i believe  
but the fact   
reform that    
that is the    
the only way   
and, yes, this 
time and       
and so the     
despite the    
that is why a  
but i believe  
i believe we   
it's been      
e pluribus     
out of many,   
that is what   
that's what    
that's what    
one of the     
at the time,   
the journey    
once here,     
it was at this 
although she   
and inspired   
years before   
she imagined   
instead, it    
here at our    
a mighty woman 
from her       
glows          
keep, ancient  
give me your   
your huddled   
send these,    
i lift my lamp 
let us         
for it falls   
and may god    
today i        
i did so with  
i'm also       
i don't make   
nor do i make  
stan           
i've got great 
over the last  
that           
i've relied on 
so all         
but war is     
and as         
the conduct    
it undermines  
and it erodes  
my multiple    
first, i have  
i've got no    
and it is my   
that includes  
the strength   
that allows us 
that's part of 
it is also     
that includes  
and that's why 
second, i have 
i believe that 
and i don't    
that, too, has 
i've just told 
doing so is    
i welcome      
all of us have 
all of us have 
our politics   
but we have to 
we need to     
our nation is  
we face a very 
but americans  
we persist and 
we will not    
so make no     
we are going   
we are going   
we are going   
that's the     
that is the    
in that        
they are with  
and general    
i'm            
it should be   
and he is      
let me say to  
general        
and he both    
in his current 
he has worked  
he has worked  
he has my full 
and i am       
let me         
indeed, it     
but the        
so, once       
i look forward 
and i reaffirm 
thank you very 
hello,         
thank you so   
thank you very 
everybody,     
thank you very 
let me just    
first of all,  
secretary of   
in addition,   
a fierce       
i want to      
, adrian fenty 
the executive  
i want to      
nurney founded 
that's the     
it's still     
he is here     
there he is    
i could use a  
one year ago   
secretary arne 
gary locke     
secretary      
and attorney   
and in each of 
how can we as  
and we did     
fathers are    
but they're    
they show us   
but we also    
we know that   
we know that   
they're more   
they're more   
they're more   
they're more   
they're more   
and i say all  
he left my     
and while i    
it's something 
so we can talk 
we can build   
we can put     
we can do      
government     
government     
that's our job 
the fact is,   
it's hard to   
and it's a     
it's           
in a time of   
in difficult   
and there are  
but here's the 
our children   
they don't     
they do need   
they need us   
they need us   
those family   
the            
and that's     
that love that 
now,           
when we talk   
too often when 
and when we do 
so i think     
we can all     
they're doing  
they deserve a 
but they       
the work of    
now, i can't   
but what we    
what we can do 
what we can do 
and that's why 
this is a call 
as part of     
and we plan to 
we're also     
we're going to 
we're also     
we'll help     
and under eric 
the idea here  
to reach       
this program   
and we are     
where's        
i just saw her 
so these       
but            
it's one that  
parent-teacher 
coaching       
scrimping and  
and plenty of  
even when we   
even with all  
i've lost      
and i know     
but i also     
think about    
i'm sure a lot 
your emotions  
and i made a   
and like a lot 
nothing else   
over the       
senator   and  
but i can say  
so you don't   
you don't need 
no matter what 
it is a        
so, happy      
god bless the  
hello,         
all right,     
i got a lot to 
first of all,  
thank you so   
we are proud   
and her mom is 
good job with  
i want to      
and i also     
mary           
now, i want to 
part of the    
and i don't    
so i'm keeping 
but it's not   
it's also      
now, i'm not   
there are      
and i don't    
in hours of    
and you don't  
a nurse will   
and when malia 
the doctor who 
and the nurse  
that was a     
now, there was 
and it was     
so, as a       
and i know     
america's      
you're on the  
and it's       
because after  
you are asked  
you're the     
and you're the 
so nurses have 
and that's     
for giving     
for providing  
and for ending 
and after a    
and that       
now, this      
i understand   
and i want to  
there you are  
give her a big 
so you've been 
and i want to  
now, already,  
we're giving   
a few weeks    
now, usually   
but this time  
a tax cut that 
that's         
in many cases, 
even though    
starting this  
and as of last 
in the         
and states     
so we've begun 
in addition,   
for too long,  
those days are 
so after my    
my secretary   
we've set up a 
and we'll      
now, as of     
but when news  
and soon       
some were also 
so we called   
and the        
in just two    
and for states 
and these      
they're going  
but what we    
and that's     
and you know   
we're also     
it will        
it will        
and beyond     
already, over  
we passed      
and we've      
and that's why 
now, there is  
and that's why 
this includes  
we want to     
and we're      
without these  
now, all of    
and by         
i don't have   
even amidst a  
and, as you    
there have     
that's what    
it's important 
often with     
one of         
and the        
later, he      
i thread my    
the hurt and   
i sit by the   
some are so    
i recall the   
your jobs are  
your days can  
but through    
and my task as 
our mission    
and god bless  
thank you,     
as we speak,   
at home, our   
abroad, our    
and tonight,   
on april 20th, 
eleven workers 
seventeen      
and soon,      
because there  
that's why     
steven chu, a  
scientists at  
as a result of 
and in the     
this is until  
already, this  
and unlike an  
the millions   
but make no    
we will fight  
we will make   
and we will do 
tonight i'd    
what we're     
first, the     
from the very  
we now have    
thousands of   
and i've       
these          
because of our 
over five and  
we've approved 
as the cleanup 
now, a         
i saw and      
so if          
if there are   
but we have to 
and sadly, no  
that's why the 
you know, for  
that living is 
i've talked to 
i've seen      
i've talked to 
the sadness    
it's about a   
i refuse to    
tomorrow, i    
and this fund  
in order to    
beyond         
the oil spill  
and the region 
that's why we  
i make that    
earlier, i     
the plan will  
and bp will    
the third part 
a few months   
that obviously 
the american   
the families i 
and so i've    
already, i've  
i know this    
and while i    
one place      
over the last  
at this        
oil companies  
when ken       
but it's now   
and so         
and his charge 
so one of the  
but a larger   
after all, oil 
we consume     
and that's     
for decades,   
for decades,   
and for        
time and       
the            
countries like 
each day, we   
and today, as  
we cannot      
the tragedy    
now is the     
this is not    
the transition 
as we speak,   
consumers are  
scientists and 
each of us has 
as we recover  
only if we     
and only if we 
scientists and 
the public and 
when i was a   
last year, the 
now, there are 
and there are  
i say we can't 
so i'm happy   
some have      
some believe   
others wonder  
all of these   
but the one    
the one answer 
you know, the  
the same thing 
and yet, time  
instead, what  
even if we're  
even if we     
we know we'll  
it's a faith   
it is that     
each year, at  
it's called    
the ceremony   
it took place  
and still,     
for as a       
the blessing   
the oil spill

that's why     
but this can't 
as michelle    
you guys       
that's why     
so we're       
we're funding  
we've made a   
those are      
because you've 
and that's my  
we're all in   
in our         
we're all      
there's not    
we all rise    
and we all     
so, yes, we're 
too many folks 
yes, we're a   
yes, we're now 
any one of     
confronting    
but look       
look at the    
you look       
you look at    
all of these   
and now, in    
you've earned  
and look at    
but they never 
they started   
as americans,  
none of these  
none of them   
and we will do 
and this city  
it will thrive 
and america's  
and our nation 
that is the    
that is the    
and i promise  
past           
and as i look  
god bless you  
good           
today, the     
this           
for years, the 
it has         
it has ignored 
security       
and while      
indeed, when i 
iran had gone  
yet this day   
we made clear  
i extended the 
and together   
we offered the 
in short, we   
so there is no 
we've made it  
that is a      
that npt       
so let me      
we recognize   
but with those 
and time and   
iran concealed 
iran further   
security       
instead,       
it has failed  
indeed, iran   
that's why the 
these are the  
they will      
they will put  
they target    
and we will    
the strong     
in voting for  
and these      
the iranian    
true security  
we know that   
and i want to  
these          
iran continues 
i would like   
indeed, these  
as i said in   
but faced with 
saturday will  
actions do     
because        
i want and     
it can make a  
today's        
thank you,     
please be      
it is good     
i am honored   
and i love you 
let me         
superintendent 
your mayor,    
thanks to      
to all the     
and i want to  
cindy, who     
and to simon,  
so i'll be     
but it gives   
now, recently, 
and it ran     
and for those  
and this       
where is   is  
she right over 
she's over     
so kelsey was  
and our school 
this is what   
well, kelsey,  
you are        
our amazing    
folks in       
now, together  
every child,   
every child,   
and i'm here   
you've got     
you've got     
you got        
arne duncan is 
it's the key   
but the most   
students who   
it's no        
that didn't    
it happened    
as the         
so, kelsey, i  
what you've    
i am proud of  
your parents   
your teachers, 
now,           
unfortunately, 
no one is      
nobody is      
going forward, 
and the        
what is each   
now, right now 
some of it's   
and so i hate  
but while i'm  
i figure i     
first,         
what you do    
how hard you   
how far you    
how high       
true           
this wasn't    
my father,     
i was raised   
and sometimes  
as my mother   
sometimes i    
sometimes i    
oh, yes, yes,  
don't be       
studied just   
i thought hard 
that's just    
but after a    
i realized     
now, you come  
you watch tv,  
you just have  
if you can     
we live in a   
and all of you 
so you're used 
but meaningful 
it's not about 
it's not       
it's usually   
it's about the 
you've got an  
he's supposed  
now, derek     
he got there   
and his high   
he always      
‘how about one 
or 25 more     
thomas edison  
think about    
rowling's      
mozart was a   
i understand   
first state    
that didn't    
they put in    
they put in    
so, today, you 
what an        
so you've got  
that's my      
don't make     
take           
take           
now, the truth 
you're not     
there are      
there will be  
there will be  
and when that  
your professor 
your boss was  
the coaches    
your friend    
your wife      
i'm just       
that was all   
no, but this   
you see it     
everybody is   
you notice     
now, this      
this community 
you could have 
but that's     
instead, this  
you resolved   
so, graduates, 
don't make     
and i hope     
don't just     
broaden your   
because that's 
that's how     
and this is    
it's a way to  
which brings   
hitch your     
i know that so 
and i commend  
but i also     
and right      
and once you   
it might be    
but just think 
what if those  
why should i   
think about    
what if our    
what if those  
i don't have   
i think i'm    
i hope it      
i want you to  
what if they   
young men and  
so you and i   
they chose to  
they chose to  
and i hope you 
we've got an   
we've got      
we've got      
we've got      
we've got an   
we've got      
and it is      
it's going to  
now, i'm not   
but as         
and i can      
and once       
it's a little  
in the end,    
it's how we    
that's the     
because their  
because their  
and i'm told   
i'm going to   
i'm going to   
i don't know   
we may never   
we know how    
and graduates, 
by pursuing    
by serving     
i know that    
after all, you 
thank you very 
and god bless  
and god bless  
thank you very 
let me begin   
jared cohon,   
i also want to 
there he is,   
it is great to 
i love         
last year, i   
to make it up, 
seeing how the 
i noticed a    
of course, we  
among other    
right now,     
and we're      
but at the     
that's what i  
it has now     
and to         
these steps    
we're again    
an economy     
after losing   
the taxpayer   
and both gm    
so, despite    
now, that      
not by a long  
the            
and it's not   
in the         
but in the     
over the last  
they saw the   
they lived     
some people    
so the anxiety 
the recession  
and for better 
long gone are  
pittsburgh, a  
and today, the 
from china to  
they're        
some countries 
they're making 
so we can't    
the united     
we got here    
we have not    
we have shaped 
america does   
we move        
and that's why 
we can't go    
we can't       
we have to     
it's a         
investments in 
investments in 
investments in 
this new       
in a global    
at the height  
and as we've   
and that's why 
that's why we  
it's why we    
to double our  
and it's why   
this, too, is  
now, some of   
from our       
they said no   
no to tax      
no to          
they said no   
and some of    
before i was   
so when i went 
before we even 
it will break  
so those       
but to be      
it's a belief  
it's an agenda 
more tax       
the last       
but what it    
no matter how  
if misfortune  
and if you're  
now, i've      
government     
government     
this is the    
i've got a     
but first let  
typically i    
today,         
as i was       
the lowest in  
we have seen   
when i came    
for the first  
in fact,       
more than      
we've cut our  
none of these  
instead, the   
since i signed 
add it all up  
in fact,       
and we've done 
bin laden,     
over the past  
through        
we've opened   
and, almost    
well, good     
and, sabah,    
you're an      
you're going   
and i suspect, 
she did great, 
she was        
to everyone    
i want to      
i want to      
as well as two 
americans      
this mosque,   
you've been    
you serve      
good           
i know you are 
not            
but you know   
it's the most  
(laughter) i   
in 2013, our   
this morning,  
the            
our tax code   
for the first  
and our        
the affordable 
combined that  
and for all    
gov in the     
in california, 
and in the     
since october  
now, this      
and you add    
it's a good    
it clears the  
and it means   
so that's a    
it's probably  
there are      
i believe that 
because        
i think we're  
we don't       
keep in mind,  
i think 2014   
we've got work 
we still have  
we've got to   
and that's     
and let me     
this year,     
by the end of  
and we'll      
and as always, 
of course, a   
so i want to   
your country   
we will keep   
i gotta tell   
that's not how 
i have now     
was running    
you know, not  
but then i     
so we do not   
the            
and if you     
it passed the  
there are      
and the fact   
i guess what   
i mean, if i   
i was polling  
i took this    
you're right,  
i think, in    
on the other   
and that is a  
that's why i   
and as long as 
let me talk    
as you know,   
i had an       
i want to      
so what we're  
over the next  
and i'm going  
here are ones  
here's how it  
and so i'm     
one specific   
and what i've  
and i think    
but what is    
and although   
the question   
i have         
and i'm going  
and we've got  
in some ways,  
we've had less 
but i think    
and just       
and the values 
well, hold on  
i think it's   
and that's a   
president, why 
isn't there a  
now part of    
so what's      
and i take     
so let me just 
it is          
that might     
there may be   
and the        
does that make 
but also does  
and we've got  
so, i   i   my 
but the        
are we doing   
are we making  
are we also    
but what i'm   
your initial   
and what i'm   
we believed    
and, that it   
what i have    
and, if that's 
so we just     
can we do this 
i think the    
so if you had  
we can't       
there are ways 
and that's     
and moving     
well, there's  
and, since i'm 
part of it, as 
part of it,    
so there are a 
and i'm gonna  
but, you know, 
and it's not   
i promise you, 
on any given   
but i've also  
and when i     
the economy is 
our next       
and there are  
we can get     
we've got a    
let's see if   
you know, i    
you know,      
but i also     
they want us   
so, you know,  
that's how i   
i'm sure that  
oh, you know   
no, we're not  
here's the     
i want   i     
i think        
it's not       
it buys back   
but, you know, 
they operated  
and given how  
and i actually 
i think        
there are a    
so let's go    
now, i can't   
the debt       
it is not      
it's not       
it's the       
it's part of   
i expect them  
although i'm   
so if          
i've got some  
if he's        
but i've got   
i said before  
i have also    
and i think    
i'll give you  
the fact of    
that cares     
that cares     
that cares     
and as a       
snowden says   
targeting      
targeting and  
who somehow    
and that's a   
so   so i      
intelligence   
but i will     
well, no,      
the majority   
but there may  
so that's the  
you're making  
but they don't 
first of all,  
so 85 percent  
and, by the    
you had this   
and that's     
and what we're 
the basic      
despite all    
and, again,    
we've got a    
and so what    
now, in        
and we're      
but that       
that's a good  
that is part   
and, you know, 
and i think    
, yeah, it's   
, you know,    
and i guess    
and every      
the question   
and i think    
well, keep in  
this is        
we don't have  
and in a state 
but we         
and, you know, 
we judge       
they said that 
and, my        
it's going to  
and my office  
on the health  
and, as i said 
but my         
and we're      
on iran, there 
already, even  
the first time 
and we now     
and as i've    
now, i've been 
it is my goal  
i'm keeping    
i would think  
and we lose    
precisely      
we'll know if  
they're not    
in fact, they  
ironically, if 
and in light   
now, if iran   
i'll work with 
but there's no 
and so i'm not 
i think the    
but as         
now's the time 
and i've heard 
president,     
well, first of 
we already     
it's not as if 
so i've heard  
listen, i      
we can do that 
but if we're   
i think i'm    
i think the    
he may deny    
he ran my      
i asked him    
but john's a   
he is as good  
and i think    
i suspect that 
you know,      
people get     
people get     
sometimes you  
but what i can 
and that's     
that's the     
and the fact   
and if they    
oday, the      
we won the     
we won the     
and though we  
, this         
and tonight,   
but we know    
we know it     
bitter         
we know our    
but we also    
we have now    
we have given  
and we are     
blacks and     
latinos and    
small states   
red states and 
this is the    
this is what   
and in this    
because at a   
we can't keep  
it's a game    
that's what    
it's a game    
that's what    
a president    
it's a game    
that's why we  
it's a game    
that's what    
that's the     
it's about     
it's change    
it's the past  
and when i'm   
john mccain is 
we honor his   
but his        
george bush    
when i am the  
john mccain    
senator mccain 
if we had      
and instead of 
and i admired  
that he        
but somewhere  
we can't keep  
we can't keep  
we can't keep  
it's time to   
we need a new  
everywhere i   
they're not    
it's a dream   
across races,  
that if you    
that you can   
that your kids 
that is our    
that is the    
it's the dream 
he needs us to 
it's the dream 
she needs us   
it's the dream 
he doesn't     
he needs us to 
and to do what 
it's the dream 
she needs      
and if her     
that's why     
we will invest 
that is our    
to reaffirm    
it's time to   
now when i     
that i need a  
that we're     
but my own     
i should not   
i was not born 
i was born to  
but my family  
because hope   
i know how     
i know this    
i've fought in 
i've fought in 
i've won some  
i've seen good 
the politics   
because        
stood up when  
and where      
it was rooted  
that citizens  
and that all   
yes we can     
yes we can     
the voices of  
now we carry   
it's the same  
that out of    
that our       
and that we    
our future     
and our time   
thank you ron  
on this        
from maine to  
plans that     
the            
there will be  
in the 2008    
we have the    
i know there's 
every four     
but once those 
for too long,  
and when some  
well we can't  
it's not only  
wrong when     
wrong when a   
wrong when 46  
in a country   
and yet, in    
for years, the 
you know the   
family         
deductibles    
co-payments    
nearly 11      
and over half  
but they say   
almost half of 
some of the    
but they say   
they tell us   
our family's   
we pay $15     
and it's       
as the         
as more        
but the        
well the       
because when   
inaction is    
doing nothing  
it's time to   
this isn't a   
a failure of   
we already     
2 trillion a   
my colleague,  
for the money  
so where's all 
we know that a 
mostly bills   
and we also    
almost every   
every          
even at the    
but because we 
this is simply 
the federal    
if you do      
if you are a   
these are all  
and the        
another, more

and we have to 
but regardless 
and we must

but it wasn't  
it was the     
the debate in  
the support    
and so

and america    
that's not who 
half a century 
for millions   
two out of     
as health care 
the resistance 
proponents of  
and yet the    
they testified 
and finally,   
the signing    
and as he      
never forget

we have come   
the time has   
and i look     
my fellow      
but tonight    
whether we

at diners and  
and every day, 
you made me a  
so i first     
still

so that's what 
not that our   
yes, our       
the work of    
it has been    
sometimes it   
for every two  
but the long
