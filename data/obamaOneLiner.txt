to chip, kathy, and nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him
to walter's friends, colleagues, protégés, and all who considered him a hero
to the men of the intrepid
to all of you who are gathered here today
i am honored to be here to pay tribute to the life and times of the man who chronicled our time
i did not know mr
cronkite personally
and my regret is made more acute by the stories that have been shared here today
nor, for that matter, did i know him any better than the tens of millions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question
what happened today
but like them and like all of you, i have benefited as a citizen from his dogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view that journalism is more than just a profession
it is a public good vital to our democracy
even in his early career, walter cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favor of getting it right
he wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting it right
during one of his first jobs in kansas city, walter's program manager urged him to go on the air reporting a massive blaze   and we just heard how much he loved fires   a massive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives
when walter reached for the telephone, his boss asked, what are you doing
get on the air
walter replied that he was calling the fire department to confirm the story
you don't need to confirm it, the manager shouted, my wife is watching the whole thing
needless to say, walter made the call, and even as the program manager took to the air himself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, walter discovered that it had been nothing more than a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries
he lost his job   but he got the story right
walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, either
but he never dared to compromise his integrity
he got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of one another's motives
one politician once remarked, walter, my friend, you've got to believe me, fully 85 percent of everything i told you today is the absolute truth
he shared a complicated relationship with presidents of both parties, who wanted him on their side even as they were convinced that he wasn't
president johnson called walter after the evening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story
but walter knew that if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job
his endless inquisitiveness about our world, i can imagine, came from a mother who sold encyclopedias for a living
as a boy, walter spent countless hours getting lost within their pages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from one another, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked
and that's the way he lived his life   with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to make sense of it and explaining it to others
he went everywhere and he did everything
he raced cars and boats
he traveled everywhere from the amazon to the arctic
he plunged 8,000 feet below the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the himalayas, and experienced weightlessness in the upper reaches of our atmosphere   all with one mission
to make it come alive for the rest of us
and as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes
he was forever there, reporting through world war and cold war
marches and milestones
scandal and success
calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know
he was a voice of certainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain
and through it all, he never lost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in the heartland
he was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of us personally
so it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in america
but here's the thing
that title wasn't bestowed on him by a network
we weren't told to believe it by some advertising campaign
it was earned
it was earned by year after year and decade after decade of painstaking effort
a commitment to fundamental values
his belief that the american people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied by theatre or spectacle
he didn't believe in dumbing down
he trusted us
when he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in america, he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife
when people of both political parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for his stances on the issues, he said no   to the relief of all potential opponents
and when, even a decade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories for television journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category, attractiveness
through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments of deepest hurt and brightest hope, walter cronkite was there, telling the story of the american age
and this is how we remember him today
but we also remember and celebrate the journalism that walter practiced   a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which so many of you have committed your careers
it's a standard that's a little bit harder to find today
we know that this is a difficult time for journalism
even as appetites for news and information grow, newsrooms are closing
despite the big stories of our era, serious journalists find themselves all too often without a beat
just as the news cycle has shrunk, so has the bottom line
and too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softer stories that walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism he championed
what happened today
is replaced with who won today
the public debate cheapens
the public trust falters
we fail to understand our world or one another as well as we should –- and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our nation
we seem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as a society
which price is higher to pay
which cost is harder to bear
this democracy, walter said, cannot function without a reasonably well-informed electorate
that's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of you pursue with the same zeal that walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society
our future depends on it
walter was no naive idealist
he understood the challenges and the pressures and the temptations facing journalism in this new era
he believed that a media company has an obligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit back into news and public affairs
he was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world of journalism would be able to tell, and all the newly-emerging means with which to tell it
naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories of our time
in an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at the speed of the internet, would he still have called to double-check
would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and the sound bites to shine the bright light on substance
would he still offer the perspective that we value
would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindling attention spans and omnipresent media
and somehow, we know that the answer is yes
the simple values walter cronkite set out in pursuit of   to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could   they are as vital today as they ever were
our american story continues
it needs to be told
and if we choose to live up to walter's example, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself as part of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve to value it once again, then i'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a false one   and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead
walter cronkite invited a nation to believe in him   and he never betrayed that trust
that's why so many of you entered the profession in the first place
that's why the standards he set for journalists still stand
and that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved and valued walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society
he's reunited with his beloved betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold with boundless optimism   every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful oh, boy
we are grateful to him for altering and illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us to say that, yes, we, too, were there
thank you very much
hello, everybody
thank you
thank you
thank you, everybody
all right, everybody go ahead and have a seat
how is everybody doing today
how about tim spicer
i am here with students at wakefield high school in arlington, virginia
and we've got students tuning in from all across america, from kindergarten through 12th grade
and i am just so glad that all could join us today
and i want to thank wakefield for being such an outstanding host
give yourselves a big round of applause
i know that for many of you, today is the first day of school
and for those of you in kindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it's understandable if you're a little nervous
i imagine there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty good right now   with just one more year to go
and no matter what grade you're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer and you could've stayed in bed just a little bit longer this morning
i know that feeling
when i was young, my family lived overseas
i lived in indonesia for a few years
and my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the american kids went to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an american education
so she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, monday through friday
but because she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4
30 in the morning
now, as you might imagine, i wasn't too happy about getting up that early
and a lot of times, i'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table
but whenever i'd complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks and she'd say, this is no picnic for me either, buster
so i know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school
but i'm here today because i have something important to discuss with you
i'm here because i want to talk with you about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year
now, i've given a lot of speeches about education
and i've talked about responsibility a lot
i've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn
i've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the tv or with the xbox
i've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, and supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve
but at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, the best schools in the world   and none of it will make a difference, none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools, unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents and grandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed
that's what i want to focus on today
the responsibility each of you has for your education
i want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself
every single one of you has something that you're good at
every single one of you has something to offer
and you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is
that's the opportunity an education can provide
maybe you could be a great writer   maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper   but you might not know it until you write that english paper   that english class paper that's assigned to you
maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor   maybe even good enough to come up with the next iphone or the new medicine or vaccine   but you might not know it until you do your project for your science class
maybe you could be a mayor or a senator or a supreme court justice   but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team
and no matter what you want to do with your life, i guarantee that you'll need an education to do it
you want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer
you want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our military
you're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers
you cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job
you've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it
and this isn't just important for your own life and your own future
what you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country
the future of america depends on you
what you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future
you'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and aids, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment
you'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free
you'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy
we need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect so you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems
if you don't do that   if you quit on school   you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country
now, i know it's not always easy to do well in school
i know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork
i get it
i know what it's like
my father left my family when i was two years old, and i was raised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had
there were times when i missed having a father in my life
there were times when i was lonely and i felt like i didn't fit in
so i wasn't always as focused as i should have been on school, and i did some things i'm not proud of, and i got in more trouble than i should have
and my life could have easily taken a turn for the worse
but i was   i was lucky
i got a lot of second chances, and i had the opportunity to go to college and law school and follow my dreams
my wife, our first lady michelle obama, she has a similar story
neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot of money
but they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country
some of you might not have those advantages
maybe you don't have adults in your life who give you the support that you need
maybe someone in your family has lost their job and there's not enough money to go around
maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don't feel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right
but at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life   what you look like, where you come from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home   none of that is an excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school
that's no excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school
there is no excuse for not trying
where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up
no one's written your destiny for you, because here in america, you write your own destiny
you make your own future
that's what young people like you are doing every day, all across america
young people like jazmin perez, from roma, texas
jazmin didn't speak english when she first started school
neither of her parents had gone to college
but she worked hard, earned good grades, and got a scholarship to brown university   is now in graduate school, studying public health, on her way to becoming dr
jazmin perez
i'm thinking about andoni schultz, from los altos, california, who's fought brain cancer since he was three
he's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affected his memory, so it took him much longer   hundreds of extra hours   to do his schoolwork
but he never fell behind
he's headed to college this fall
and then there's shantell steve, from my hometown of chicago, illinois
even when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city, she managed to get a job at a local health care center, start a program to keep young people out of gangs, and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college
and jazmin, andoni, and shantell aren't any different from any of you
they face challenges in their lives just like you do
in some cases they've got it a lot worse off than many of you
but they refused to give up
they chose to take responsibility for their lives, for their education, and set goals for themselves
and i expect all of you to do the same
that's why today i'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education   and do everything you can to meet them
your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book
maybe you'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community
maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look, because you believe, like i do, that all young people deserve a safe environment to study and learn
maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself so you can be more ready to learn
and along those lines, by the way, i hope all of you are washing your hands a lot, and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter
but whatever you resolve to do, i want you to commit to it
i want you to really work at it
i know that sometimes you get that sense from tv that you can be rich and successful without any hard work   that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality tv star
chances are you're not going to be any of those things
the truth is, being successful is hard
you won't love every subject that you study
you won't click with every teacher that you have
not every homework assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right at this minute
and you won't necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try
that's okay
some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failures
rowling's   who wrote harry potter   her first harry potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally published
michael jordan was cut from his high school basketball team
he lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career
but he once said, i have failed over and over and over again in my life
and that's why i succeed
these people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you   you have to let your failures teach you
you have to let them show you what to do differently the next time
so if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it means you need to try harder to act right
if you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying
no one's born being good at all things
you become good at things through hard work
you're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport
you don't hit every note the first time you sing a song
you've got to practice
the same principle applies to your schoolwork
you might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right
you might have to read something a few times before you understand it
you definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it's good enough to hand in
don't be afraid to ask questions
don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it
i do that every day
asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it shows you have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and that then allows you to learn something new
so find an adult that you trust   a parent, a grandparent or teacher, a coach or a counselor   and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals
and even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country
the story of america isn't about people who quit when things got tough
it's about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than their best
it's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage a revolution and they founded this nation
young people
students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a depression and won a world war
who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon
students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded google and twitter and facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other
so today, i want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be
what problems are you going to solve
what discoveries will you make
what will a president who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country
now, your families, your teachers, and i are doing everything we can to make sure you have the education you need to answer these questions
i'm working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn
but you've got to do your part, too
so i expect all of you to get serious this year
i expect you to put your best effort into everything you do
i expect great things from each of you
so don't let us down
don't let your family down or your country down
most of all, don't let yourself down
make us all proud
thank you very much, everybody
god bless you
god bless america
thank you
your eminence, vicki, kara, edward, patrick, curran, caroline, members of the kennedy family, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens
today we say goodbye to the youngest child of rose and joseph kennedy
the world will long remember their son edward as the heir to a weighty legacy
a champion for those who had none
the soul of the democratic party
and the lion of the u
senate - a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws, and who penned more than three hundred himself
but those of us who loved him, and ache with his passing, know ted kennedy by the other titles he held
father
brother
husband
uncle teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews, the grand fromage, or the big cheese
i, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearly half a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, a friend
ted kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch
the restless dreamer who became its rock
he was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how to brush it off
when they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old teddy got back in and learned to sail
when a photographer asked the newly-elected bobby to step back at a press conference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, teddy quipped, it'll be the same in washington
this spirit of resilience and good humor would see ted kennedy through more pain and tragedy than most of us will ever know
he lost two siblings by the age of sixteen
he saw two more taken violently from the country that loved them
he said goodbye to his beloved sister, eunice, in the final days of his own life
he narrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, and experienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible
it is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man
and it would have been easy for teddy to let himself become bitter and hardened
to surrender to self-pity and regret
to retreat from public life and live out his years in peaceful quiet
no one would have blamed him for that
but that was not ted kennedy
as he told us,
ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - and no exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves
indeed, ted was the happy warrior that the poet william wordsworth spoke of when he wrote
as tempted more
more able to endure,
as more exposed to suffering and distress
thence, also, more alive to tenderness
through his own suffering, ted kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others - the sick child who could not see a doctor
the young soldier sent to battle without armor
the citizen denied her rights because of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from
the landmark laws that he championed   the civil rights act, the americans with disabilities act, immigration reform, children's health care, the family and medical leave act -all have a running thread
ted kennedy's life's work was not to champion those with wealth or power or special connections
it was to give a voice to those who were not heard
to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity
to make real the dream of our founding
he was given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow
we can still hear his voice bellowing through the senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium, a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights
and yet, while his causes became deeply personal, his disagreements never did
while he was seen by his fiercest critics as a partisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which ted kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prism through which his colleagues saw him
he was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politics prevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect - a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots
and that's how ted kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time
he did it by hewing to principle, but also by seeking compromise and common cause - not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, but through friendship, and kindness, and humor
there was the time he courted orrin hatch's support for the children's health insurance program by having his chief of staff serenade the senator with a song orrin had written himself
the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crusty republican colleague
and the famous story of how he won the support of a texas committee chairman on an immigration bill
teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only the chairman that it was filled with the texan's favorite cigars
when the negotiations were going well, he would inch the envelope closer to the chairman
when they weren't, he would pull it back
before long, the deal was done
it was only a few years ago, on st
patrick's day, when teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the senate for my support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote
i gave him my pledge, but expressed my skepticism that it would pass
but when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes it needed, and then some
i looked at teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off
he just patted me on the back, and said luck of the irish
of course, luck had little to do with ted kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that
a few years ago, his father-in-law told him that he and daniel webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time
without missing a beat, teddy replied, what did webster do
but though it is ted kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that we will miss
it was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, i'm sorry for your loss, or i hope you feel better, or what can i do to help
it was the boss who was so adored by his staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party
it was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imagined that a u
senator would take the time to think about someone like them
i have one of those paintings in my private study - a cape cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire it when ted kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in washington
by the way, that's my second favorite gift from teddy and vicki after our dog bo
and it seems like everyone has one of those stories - the ones that often start with you wouldn't believe who called me today
ted kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but john's and bobby's as well
he took them camping and taught them to sail
he laughed and danced with them at birthdays and weddings
cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy
and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him
shortly after ted walked caroline down the aisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from jackie that read, on you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared
we are all going to make it because you were always there with your love
not only did the kennedy family make it because of ted's love - he made it because of theirs
and especially because of the love and the life he found in vicki
after so much loss and so much sorrow, it could not have been easy for ted kennedy to risk his heart again
that he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from louisiana
and she didn't just love him back
as ted would often acknowledge, vicki saved him
she gave him strength and purpose
joy and friendship
and stood by him always, especially in those last, hardest days
we cannot know for certain how long we have here
we cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way
we cannot know god's plan for us
what we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy
we can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves
we can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures
and we can strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here, we can know that we spent it well
that we made a difference
that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings
this is how ted kennedy lived
this is his legacy
he once said of his brother bobby that he need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and i imagine he would say the same about himself
the greatest expectations were placed upon ted kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he became
we do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his name or his office
we weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who persevered through pain and tragedy - not for the sake of ambition or vanity
not for wealth or power
but only for the people and the country he loved
in the days after september 11th, teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families of this state who lost a loved one in the attack
but he didn't stop there
he kept calling and checking up on them
he fought through red tape to get them assistance and grief counseling
he invited them sailing, played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible day came along
to one widow, he wrote the following
as you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss, but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because there is still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us
we carry on
ted kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost
at last he is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the good he did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image - the image of a man on a boat
white mane tousled
smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on toward some new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon
may god bless ted kennedy, and may he rest in eternal peace
hello, michigan
thank you
thank you so much
first of all, give joe a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction
we've got some special guests here   now, if everybody has chairs, go ahead and use them
feel free
we've got some special guests here today that i just want to acknowledge
all of you are special, but these folks i want to make sure that you have a chance to see them
first of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give jennifer granholm a big round of applause
lieutenant governor john cherry   give john a big round of applause
one of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of working families each and every day   senator debbie stabenow
we've got speaker of the house, andy dillon, in the house
we've got a lot of other local elected officials, and i just want to thank them
a couple of people who are missing
carl levin, who is doing great work
he's in the senate right now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch of necessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending
so he's the point person on it
the only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to get this bill done
please give him a big round of applause
congressman sandy levin, also working hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today
i want to go ahead and acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor   mayor dave bing, great ball player
my game is a little like dave bing's   except i don't have the jump shot or the speed or the ball handling skills   or the endurance
also don't have the afro
don't think i forgot that, dave
i remember
i remember that
i also want to acknowledge that we've got the executive director of the white house council on auto communities and workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each and every day
he's traveling constantly back here   ed montgomery
please give ed a big round of applause
and the chairman of the grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indian tribe, derek bailey is here
please give derek a big round of applause
and finally, the president of the college where we are here, jim jacobs
give jim jacobs a big round of applause
and those of you who i've missed, you know how grateful i am that you're here
and thank you all
it is wonderful to be back at macomb
it was terrific visiting this campus as a candidate, but i have to admit, it's even better visiting as a president
now, this is a place where anyone   anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take their career to a new level or start a new career altogether   has the opportunity to pursue their dream, right here in macomb
this is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds   even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges   can take a chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families
there are folks like joe, who just told us his story
when joe lost his job, he decided to take advantage of assistance for displaced workers
he earned his associate degree here at macomb, and with a pretty impressive gpa, i might add
and with the help of that degree, joe found a new job, working for the new henry ford west bloomfield hospital as a maintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought to make a fresh start
there are workers like kellie kulman, who is here today
where's kellie
raise your hand, kellie
where are you
there you are
there's kellie right there
kellie is a uaw worker at a ford plant in sterling heights, michigan
she used to drive a fork lift, right
but then she decided to train here at macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's an apprentice pipe fitter
it's a telling example
even as this painful restructuring takes place in our auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs
and joe and kellie's story make clear what all of you know
community colleges are an essential part of our recovery in the present   and our prosperity in the future
this place can make the future better, not just for these individuals but for america
now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6
5 million americans have lost their jobs, and i don't have to tell you michigan in particular has been hard-hit
now, i   the statistics are daunting
the whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent
here in michigan, it's about five points higher
and new jobs of course are going to be coming out and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize
now, that's not just abstractions
those just aren't numbers on a page
those are extraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all their lives and have done the right things all their lives
if you haven't lost a job, chances are you know somebody who has
a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker
and you know that as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just a paycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do
that's part of what it means to be an american
we take pride in work   that sense that you're contributing, supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities
people need work not just for income, but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important
and so when you lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavy burden, that's a heavy weight
now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back on its feet
that's my job
and it's a job i gladly accept
i love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then suddenly say, well, this is obama's economy
that's fine
give it to me
my job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe
so i welcome the job
i want the responsibility
and i know that   let's just take an example
many questioned our efforts to help save gm and chrysler from collapse earlier this year
their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor management decisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable for those decisions
i agree that they should be held accountable
but i also recognize the historic significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all across michigan and all across the country
i thought about the hundreds of thousands of americans whose livelihoods are still connected to the american auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especially right here in michigan
so i said that if chrysler and gm were willing to fundamentally restructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive now and in the future, it was a process worth supporting
now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both gm and chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy
remember, folks said there was no way they could do it
they've gotten it done already, in record time   far faster than anybody thought possible
they've got a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to compete and win in the 21st century
those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders
workers and management
creditors and shareholders
retirees and communities
and together, they've made the rebirth of chrysler and gm possible
it was the right thing to do
but even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back
they're the casualties of a changing economy
in some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselves means that some jobs aren't going to return
and that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create
for even before this recession hit, we were faced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-paying jobs
so now is the time to change all that
what we face is far more than a passing crisis
this is a transformative moment
and in this moment we must do what other generations have done
it's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions
that's what washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why i ran for president   to change that mindset
now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth that will not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in a global economy
to build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care costs that are driving us into debt
we're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a major debate over the next three weeks
and don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying we can't change the health care system
we have no choice but to change the health care system, because right now it's broken for too many americans
we're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits
but don't let folks fool you   the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health care costs, which is why we need reform
now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new clean energy economy
and jennifer granholm has been all on top of this as the governor of michigan
she is bring cleaning  energy jobs right here to michigan, and we've got to support her in that effort
i want michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants and energy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our   because, michigan, you know bad weather
so you can be all on top of weatherizing
you need to weatherize
i know about that in chicago too
but we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs of the 21st century
we've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in this global economy
time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, we have prospered as a result   by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential of a skilled american workforce
that's what happened when president lincoln signed into law legislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, but also our entire economy
that's what took place when president roosevelt signed the gi bill which helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity
that was the foundation for the american middle class
and that's why, at the start of my administration i set a goal for america
by 2020, this nation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world
we used to have that
we're going to have it again
and we've begun to take historic steps to achieve this goal
already we've increased pell grants by $500
we've created a $2,500 tax credit for four years of college tuition
we've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid is not based on the income of a job that you just lost
a new gi bill of rights for the 21st century is beginning to help soldiers coming home from iraq and afghanistan to begin a new life   in a new economy
and the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls   which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges   at the same time making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all across america
so we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21st century education system here in america, one that will allow us to compete with china and india and everybody else all around the world
but today i'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal of having the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world
we're going to achieve this in the next 10 years
and it's called the american graduation initiative
it will reform and strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resources that students and schools need   and the results workers and businesses demand
through this plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million americans earn degrees and certificates in the next decade   5 million
not since the passage of the original gi bill and the work of president truman's commission on higher education   which helped to double the number of community colleges and increase by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges   have we taken such a historic step on behalf of community colleges in america
and let me be clear
we pay for this plan   this isn't adding to the deficit
we're paying for this plan   by ending the wasteful subsidies we currently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans
that will save tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years
instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's time this money went towards the interests of higher education in america
that's what my administration is committed to doing
now, i know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as a silver bullet and college as a cure-all
it's not, and we know that
i can't tell you how many workers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, training for what
so i understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training is not well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there
but we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience
we will not fill those jobs   or even keep those jobs here in america   without the training offered by community colleges
that's why i want to applaud governor granholm for the no worker left behind program
it's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges and universities across the state
the rest of the country should learn from the effort
this is training to become a medical technician, or a health it worker, or a lab specialist, or a nurse
in fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges
this is training to install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop a smarter electricity grid
and this is the kind of education that more and more americans are using to improve their skills and broaden their horizons
many young people are saving money by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college
and more workers who have lost their jobs   or fear losing a job   are seeking an edge at schools like this one
at the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments and scrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls
and this is in addition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far less funding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities
so community colleges are an undervalued asset in our country
not only is that not right, it's not smart
that's why i've asked dr
jill biden   who happens to be a relation of the vice president, joe biden, but who is also a community college educator for more than 16 years   to promote community colleges and help us make community colleges stronger
and that's why we're putting in place this american graduation initiative
let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do
number one, we will offer competitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-oriented strategies in exchange for federal funding
we'll fund programs that connect students looking for jobs with businesses that are looking to hire
we'll challenge these schools to find new and better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that are essential to our competitiveness
we'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom
these are all kinds of   there are all kinds of examples of what's possible
we've seen cisco, for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobs ranging from work in broadband to health it
we know that the most successful community colleges are those that partner with the private sector
so we want to encourage more companies to work with schools to build these type of relationships
that way, when somebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of that training
we'll also create a new research center with a simple mission
to measure what works and what doesn't
all too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of a classroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or   the laboratory or the office
and that means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth
and schools themselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive   achieve results and which programs don't
and this is important, not just for businesses and colleges, but for students and workers, as well
if a parent is going to spend time in the classroom and away from his or her family   especially after a long day at work   that degree really has to mean something
they have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals
if a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, that certificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire
in addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not just enrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program
see, more than half   more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associate degree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail to reach their goal
that's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for these students
oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still have to pay back the debt
and it's a disaster for our economy
so we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom
let's figure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reforms that will remove those barriers
maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away from home, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift
maybe a young student just isn't sure if her education will lead to employment
the point is, we need to figure out solutions for these kinds of challenges   because facing these impediments shouldn't prevent you from reaching your potential
all right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative
the second part
we're going to back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all across the country
all too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the higher education system
they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all
and that means schools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st century economy, they're years behind in the education they can offer
that's a mistake and it's one that we'll help to correct
through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across the country
and by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they're providing, guess what
you also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and women to do the work on those schools
so it means it's putting people to work in michigan right here right now
number three
even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a new virtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer
so we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of courses so that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building more classrooms
and this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot of times have struggled   attract   have to struggle to attract students and faculty
and this will make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for a student who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework
we don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to try it because i think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for people who are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skills without having to quit their job
so let me say this more
the road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard
it was never going to be easy
when i was sworn in, we were seeing 700  jobs lost that month
then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months
now we've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost   but we're still losing too many jobs
we will get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to the point where we're actually creating jobs
and it's going to take time
there are going to be false starts and there are going to be setbacks
but i am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's what we've always done
that's what america does
we hit some challenges, we fuss and argue about it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems
that's what we see on display right here at macomb community college
that's what i've seen at colleges and universities all across this country
at every juncture in our history when we've been challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness   that can-do american spirit   that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds
that's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave something better behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosper and take responsibility for their future   just as the students at this school, at this difficult moment, are taking responsibility for theirs
i am absolutely confident that if i've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we are going to see a stronger, more prosperous michigan in the years to come
thank you very much, warren
god bless you
god bless the united states of america
good morning, everybody
before i introduce america's next surgeon general, i'd like to say a few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will help oversee
we are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been
over the last several weeks, key committees in the house and the senate have made important and unprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs, provide better care for patients, and curb the worst practices of the insurance companies
it's a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade
let me repeat that
it is a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade   and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost of medicare and medicaid
even though we are close, i've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finish line
there are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said and done
but health care reform must be done
i know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a more incremental approach, or simply do nothing
but this is the kind of criticism we heard when the country tried to pass medicare, a program that is now providing quality care to generations of american seniors
it's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass the children's health insurance program, which has provided quality care and coverage to millions of kids
it's the same washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off tough decisions for decades
and it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into the current predicament
so make no mistake
the status quo on health care is no longer an option for the united states of america
if we step back from this challenge right now, we will leave our children a legacy of debt   a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, and because we will have done nothing to bring down the cost of medicare and medicaid, will crush our government
premiums will continue to skyrocket   placing what amounts to another tax on american families struggling to pay bills
the insurance companies and special interests that have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more   and they'll continue to deny coverage to americans with pre-existing medical conditions
people will continue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs
this is a future that we cannot afford
this country can't afford to have health care premiums rise three times faster than people's wages, as they did over the last decade
we can't afford 14,000 americans losing their health care every single day
we can't afford a future where our government will eventually spend more on medicare and medicaid than what we spend on everything else
and during the campaign, i promised health care reform that would control costs, expand coverage, and ensure choice
and i promised that americans making $250,000 a year or less would not pay more in taxes
these are promises that we're keeping as reform moves forward
this is no longer a problem we can wait to fix
this is about who we are as a country
health care reform is about every family's health, but it's also about the health of the economy
so i just want to put everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the week that i was gone
we are going to get this done
inaction is not an option
and for those nay-sayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen, don't bet against us
we are going to make this thing happen, because the american people desperately need it
and even those who are satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that if premiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it's unsustainable and if you look at the trajectory of where medicare and medicaid are going, then inaction will create the biggest crisis of all
and so i understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change
the muscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied, but we're whipping folks back into shape
we are going to get this done
and if there's anyone who understands the urgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, it's the woman who will become our nation's next surgeon general, dr
regina benjamin
the list of qualifications that make dr
benjamin an outstanding candidate to be america's leading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed
she was in the second class at morehouse school of medicine and went on to earn an md from the university of alabama at birmingham and an mba from tulane
she served as associate dean for rural health at the university of south alabama college of medicine, and in 1995, she became the first physician under 40 and the first african american woman to be named to the american medical association's board of trustees
in 2002, she became president of alabama's state medical association
and she has received numerous awards and recognitions, including the macarthur genius award
it's very impressive
but of all these achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today's challenges or closer to regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuilt in bayou la batre   did i say that right
well, tell me how to say it
benjamin
bayou la batre
bayou la batre
that's in alabama, people
bayou la batre is a rural town of about 2,500 people
it's a shrimping town, where a lot of folks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually afford health insurance
and by the way, dr
benjamin, while we were talking in the oval office, described for me the demographics of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got whites, blacks, and asians in this community
there are a lot of laotians and cambodians who have moved there and are part of this shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community
and like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are hard to come by
and that's why, even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a wealthier community, regina benjamin returned to alabama and opened a small clinic in bayou la batre
when people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them
when the clinic wasn't making money, she didn't take a salary for herself
when hurricane george destroyed the clinic in 1998, she made house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt
when hurricane katrina destroyed it again and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time
she tended to those who had been wounded in the storm, and when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the bill her way
and when regina's clinic was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to the ground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess what dr
benjamin did
with help from her community, she is rebuilding it again
one disabled patient brought her an envelope with $20 inside
another elderly man said simply, maybe i can help
i got a hammer
for nearly two decades, dr
regina benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken about our health care system
she's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive
she's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellness programs, having treated too many costly and   diseases and complications that didn't have to happen
and she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved areas where she works
but for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, regina benjamin also represents what's best about health care in america   doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients
those americans who would do anything to heal a fellow citizen
through floods and fires and severe want, regina benjamin has refused to give up
her patients have refused to give up
and when we were talking in the oval office, she said
the one thing i want to do is make sure that this surgeon general's office gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table
somebody is advocating for them and speaking for them
and now we in washington and across america have to refuse to give up on the goal of health care that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us
we don't have to deal with hurricanes and we don't have to deal with floods and we don't have to deal with fires
all we have to do is pass a bill to make sure that the american people have a decent shot at getting the kind of choice and high-quality health care that's affordable
and i know that dr
benjamin is going to help us get there as the next surgeon general
and i am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and secretary sebelius is equally excited, even though she's just standing here
with that, let me introduce the next surgeon general of the united states, dr
regina benjamin
good morning
it is a great honor for me to join you at the new economic school
michelle and i are so pleased to be in moscow
and as somebody who was born in hawaii, i'm glad to be here in july instead of january
i know that nes is a young school, but i speak to you today with deep respect for russia's timeless heritage
russian writers have helped us understand the complexity of the human experience, and recognize eternal truths
russian painters, composers, and dancers have introduced us to new forms of beauty
russian scientists have cured disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go to space
these are contributions that are not contained by russia's borders, as vast as those borders are
indeed, russia's heritage has touched every corner of the world, and speaks to the humanity that we share
that includes my own country, which has been blessed with russian immigrants for decades
we've been enriched by russian culture, and enhanced by russian cooperation
and as a resident of washington, d
, i continue to benefit from the contributions of russians   specifically, from alexander ovechkin
we're very pleased to have him in washington, d
here at nes, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your focus on economics is no less fundamental to the future of humanity
as pushkin said, inspiration is needed in geometry just as much as poetry
and today, i want particularly to speak to those of you preparing to graduate
you're poised to be leaders in academia and industry
in finance and government
but before you move forward, it's worth reflecting on what has already taken place during your young lives
like president medvedev and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest hours of the cold war, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, and we reached the brink of nuclear catastrophe
but you are the last generation born when the world was divided
at that time, the american and soviet armies were still massed in europe, trained and ready to fight
the ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in place
competition in everything from astrophysics to athletics was treated as a zero-sum game
if one person won, then the other person had to lose
and then, within a few short years, the world as it was ceased to be
now, make no mistake
this change did not come from any one nation
the cold war reached a conclusion because of the actions of many nations over many years, and because the people of russia and eastern europe stood up and decided that its end would be peaceful
with the end of the cold war, there were extraordinary expectations   for peace and for prosperity
for new arrangements among nations, and new opportunities for individuals
like all periods of great change, it was a time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities
but, of course, things don't always work out exactly as planned
back in 1993, shortly after this school opened, one nes student summed up the difficulty of change when he told a reporter, and i quote him
the real world is not so rational as on paper
the real world is not so rational as on paper
over two tumultuous decades, that truth has been borne out around the world
great wealth has been created, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of crushing poverty
poverty exists here, it exists in the united states, and it exists all around the world
more people have gone to the ballot box, but too many governments still fail to protect the rights of their people
ideological struggles have diminished, but they've been replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and religion
a human being with a computer can hold the same amount of information stored in the russian state library, but that technology can also be used to do great harm
in a new russia, the disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the end of the soviet union brought both opportunity and hardship
a few prospered, but many more did not
there were tough times
but the russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved hard-earned progress through a growing economy and greater confidence
and despite painful times, many in eastern europe and russia are much better off today than 20 years ago
we see that progress here at nes   a school founded with western support that is now distinctly russian
a place of learning and inquiry where the test of an idea is not whether it is russian or american or european, but whether it works
above all, we see that progress in all of you   young people with a young century to shape as you see fit
your lifetime coincides with this era of transition
but think about the fundamental questions asked when this school was founded
what kind of future is russia going to have
what kind of future are russia and america going to have together
what world order will replace the cold war
those questions still don't have clear answers, and so now they must be answered by you   by your generation in russia, in america, and around the world
you get to decide
and while i cannot answer those questions for you, i can speak plainly about the future that america is seeking
to begin with, let me be clear
america wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous russia
this belief is rooted in our respect for the russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyond competition
despite our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of the last century
recently, i noted this when i was in normandy   for just as men from boston and birmingham risked all that they had to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, soviet soldiers from places like kazan and kiev endured unimaginable hardships to repeal   to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east
as president john kennedy said, no nation in history of battle ever suffered more than the soviet union in the second world war
so as we honor this past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a strong and vibrant russia
think of the issues that will define your lives
security from nuclear weapons and extremism
access to markets and opportunity
health and the environment
an international system that protects sovereignty and human rights, while promoting stability and prosperity
these challenges demand global partnership, and that partnership will be stronger if russia occupies its rightful place as a great power
yet unfortunately, there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of thinking
a conception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future
there is the 20th century view that the united states and russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong russia or a strong america can only assert themselves in opposition to one another
and there is a 19th century view that we are destined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must forge competing blocs to balance one another
these assumptions are wrong
in 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizing other countries
the days when empires could treat sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over
as i said in cairo, given our independence, any world order that   given our interdependence, any world order that tries to elevate one nation or one group of people over another will inevitably fail
the pursuit of power is no longer a zero-sum game   progress must be shared
that's why i have called for a reset in relations between the united states and russia
this must be more than a fresh start between the kremlin and the white house   though that is important and i've had excellent discussions with both your president and your prime minister
it must be a sustained effort among the american and russian people to identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation that can pave the way to progress
this will not be easy
it's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former adversaries, it's hard to change habits that have been ingrained in our governments and our bureaucracies for decades
but i believe that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, americans and russians share common interests that form a basis for cooperation
it is not for me to define russia's national interests, but i can tell you about america's national interests, and i believe that you will see that we share common ground
first, america has an interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing their use
in the last century, generations of americans and russians inherited the power to destroy nations, and the understanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction
in 2009, our inheritance is different
you and i don't have to ask whether american and russian leaders will respect a balance of terror   we understand the horrific consequences of any war between our two countries
but we do have to ask this question
we have to ask whether extremists who have killed innocent civilians in new york and in moscow will show that same restraint
we have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed nations will protect their arsenals and refrain from using them
this is the core of the nuclear challenge in the 21st century
the notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons, is an illusion
in the short period since the end of the cold war, we've already seen india, pakistan, and north korea conduct nuclear tests
without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believe that the next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these nuclear weapons
that's why america is committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking a world without nuclear weapons
that is consistent with our commitment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
that is our responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers
and while i know this goal won't be met soon, pursuing it provides the legal and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use of nuclear weapons
we're already taking important steps to build this foundation
yesterday, president medvedev and i made progress on negotiating a new treaty that will substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems
we renewed our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which must be a right for all nations that live up to their responsibilities under the npt
and we agreed to increase cooperation on nuclear security, which is essential to achieving the goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years
as we keep our own commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs
whether america or russia, neither of us would benefit from a nuclear arms race in east asia or the middle east
that's why we should be united in opposing north korea's efforts to become a nuclear power, and opposing iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon
and i'm pleased that president medvedev and i agreed upon a joint threat assessment of the ballistic challenges   ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from iran and north korea
this is not about singling out individual nations   it's about the responsibilities of all nations
if we fail to stand together, then the npt and the security council will lose credibility, and international law will give way to the law of the jungle
and that benefits no one
as i said in prague, rules must be binding, violations must be punished, and words must mean something
the successful enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement
i know russia opposes the planned configuration for missile defense in europe
and my administration is reviewing these plans to enhance the security of america, europe and the world
and i've made it clear that this system is directed at preventing a potential attack from iran
it has nothing to do with russia
in fact, i want to work together with russia on a missile defense architecture that makes us all safer
but if the threat from iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense in europe will be eliminated, and that is in our mutual interests
now, in addition to securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where america has a critical national interest is in isolating and defeating violent extremists
for years, al qaeda and its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, and ruthlessly murdered men, women and children of all nationalities and faiths
indeed, above all, they have murdered muslims
and these extremists have killed in amman and bali
islamabad and kabul
and they have the blood of americans and russians on their hands
they're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefit from safe havens that allow them to train and operate   particularly along the border of pakistan and afghanistan
and that's why america has a clear goal
to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda and its allies in afghanistan and pakistan
we seek no bases, nor do we want to control these nations
instead, we want to work with international partners, including russia, to help afghans and pakistanis advance their own security and prosperity
and that's why i'm pleased that russia has agreed to allow the united states to supply our coalition forces through your territory
neither america nor russia has an interest in an afghanistan or pakistan governed by the taliban
it's time to work together on behalf of a different future   a future in which we leave behind the great game of the past and the conflict of the present
a future in which all of us contribute to the security of central asia
now, beyond afghanistan, america is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate extremists
we are helping the iraqi people build a better future, and leaving iraq to the iraqis
we're pursuing the goal of two states, israel and palestine, living in peace and security
we're partnering with muslim communities around the world to advance education, health, and economic development
in each of these endeavors, i believe that the russian people share our goals, and will benefit from success   and we need to partner together
now, in addition to these security concerns, the third area that i will discuss is america's interest in global prosperity
and since we have so many economists and future businessmen and women in the room, i know this is of great interest to you
we meet in the midst of the worst global recession in a generation
i believe that the free market is the greatest force for creating and distributing wealth that the world has known
but wherever the market is allowed to run rampant   through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or corruption   then all are endangered, whether we live on the mississippi or on the volga
in america, we're now taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our system of regulation
but just as no nation can wall itself off from the consequences of a global crisis, no one can serve as the sole engine of global growth
you see, during your lives, something fundamental has changed
and while this crisis has shown us the risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by opportunity
think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago
a young woman with an internet connection in bangalore, india can compete with anybody anywhere in the world
an entrepreneur with a start-up company in beijing can take his business global
an nes professor in moscow can collaborate with colleagues at harvard or stanford
that's good for all of us, because when prosperity is created in india, that's a new market for our goods
when new ideas take hold in china, that pushes our businesses to innovate
when new connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched
there is extraordinary potential for increased cooperation between americans and russians
we can pursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world
we can boost investment that creates jobs in both our countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only traditional resources, like oil and gas, but new sources of energy that will drive growth and combat climate change
all of that, americans and russians can do together
now, government can promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance this cooperation, because the greatest resource of any nation in the 21st century is you
it's people
it's young people especially
and the country which taps that resource will be the country that will succeed
that success depends upon economies that function within the rule of law
as president medvedev has rightly said, a mature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development
people everywhere should have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe
whether they are in america or russia or africa or latin america, that's not a american idea or a russian idea   that's how people and countries will succeed in the 21st century
and this brings me to the fourth issue that i will discuss   america's interest in democratic governments that protect the rights of their people
by no means is america perfect
but it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us to correct our imperfections, to improve constantly, and to grow stronger over time
freedom of speech and assembly has allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and equal rights at a time when they were denied
the rule of law and equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut down political machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power
independent media have exposed corruption at all levels of business and government
competitive elections allow us to change course and hold our leaders accountable
if our democracy did not advance those rights, then i, as a person of african ancestry, wouldn't be able to address you as an american citizen, much less a president
because at the time of our founding, i had no rights   people who looked like me
but it is because of that process that i can now stand before you as president of the united states
so around the world, america supports these values because they are moral, but also because they work
the arc of history shows that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive
governments which serve only their own power do not
governments that represent the will of their people are far less likely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others
governments that promote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are more dependable trading partners
and in our own history, democracies have been america's most enduring allies, including those we once waged war with in europe and asia   nations that today live with great security and prosperity
now let me be clear
america cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on any other country, nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country
and we haven't always done what we should have on that front
even as we meet here today, america supports now the restoration of the democratically-elected president of honduras, even though he has strongly opposed american policies
we do so not because we agree with him
we do so because we respect the universal principle that people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with or not
and that leads me to the final area that i will discuss, which is america's interest in an international system that advances cooperation while respecting the sovereignty of all nations
state sovereignty must be a cornerstone of international order
just as all states should have the right to choose their leaders, states must have the right to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies
that is true for russia, just as it is true for the united states
any system that cedes those rights will lead to anarchy
that's why we must apply this principle to all nations   and that includes nations like georgia and ukraine
america will never impose a security arrangement on another country
for any country to become a member of an organization like nato, for example, a majority of its people must choose to
they must undertake reforms
they must be able to contribute to the alliance's mission
and let me be clear
nato should be seeking collaboration with russia, not confrontation
and more broadly, we need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and peoples
as president of the united states, i will work tirelessly to protect america's security and to advance our interests
but no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world
that is something that america now understands, just as russia understands
that's why america seeks an international system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interests diverge
a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed
a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, with clear rights and responsibilities for all
there was a time when roosevelt, churchill, and stalin could shape the world in one meeting
those days are over
the world is more complex today
billions of people have found their voice, and seek their own measure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the planet
over the past two decades, we've witnessed markets grow, wealth spread, and technology used to build   not destroy
we've seen old hatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift and fade away
we've seen the human destiny in the hands of more and more human beings who can shape their own destinies
now, we must see that the period of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, and people realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life for their children
that is america's interest, and i believe that it is russia's interest as well
i know that this future can seem distant
change is hard
in the words of that nes student back in 1993, the real world is not so rational as on paper
but think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time
one hundred years ago, a czar ruled russia, and europe was a place of empire
when i was born, segregation was still the law of the land in parts of america, and my father's kenya was still a colony
when you were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and the internet was only known to a privileged few
you get to decide what comes next
you get to choose where change will take us, because the future does not belong to those who gather armies on a field of battle or bury missiles in the ground
the future belongs to young people with an education and the imagination to create
that is the source of power in this century
and given all that has happened in your two decades on earth, just imagine what you can create in the years to come
every country charts its own course
russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river through a canyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it goes
as you move this story forward, look to the future that can be built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old suspicions
look to the future that can be built if we partner on behalf of the aspirations we hold in common
together, we can build a world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our power truly serves progress
and it is all in your hands
good luck to all of you
thank you very much
good afternoon, everybody
today i want to start by addressing three issues, and then i'll take your questions
first, i'd like to say a few words about the situation in iran
the united states and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, and imprisonments of the last few days
i strongly condemn these unjust actions, and i join with the american people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost
i've made it clear that the united states respects the sovereignty of the islamic republic of iran, and is not interfering with iran's affairs
but we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within iranian society
and we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place
the iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future
some in iran   some in the iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the united states and others in the west of instigating protests over the election
these accusations are patently false
they're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within iran's borders
this tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in iran
this is not about the united states or the west
this is about the people of iran, and the future that they   and only they   will choose
the iranian people can speak for themselves
that's precisely what's happened in the last few days
in 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice
despite the iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the iranian people are doing
this is what we've witnessed
we've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of iranians marching in silence
we've seen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their voices are heard
above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets
while this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this
those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history
as i said in cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away
the iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech
if the iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people
it must govern through consent and not coercion
that's what iran's own people are calling for, and the iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government
thank you so much
please, everybody, be seated
thank you very much
you're very kind
thank you
let me begin by thanking nancy for the wonderful introduction
i want to thank dr
joseph heyman, the chair of the board of trustees, as well as dr
jeremy lazarus, speaker of house of delegates
thanks to all of you for bringing me home, even if it's just for a day
from the moment i took office as president, the central challenge we've confronted as a nation has been the need to lift ourselves out of the worst recession since world war ii
in recent months, we've taken a series of extraordinary steps, not just to repair the immediate damage to our economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting and sustained growth
we're here to create new jobs, to unfreeze our credit markets
we're stemming the loss of homes and the decline of home values
all this is important
but even as we've made progress, we know that the road to prosperity remains long and it remains difficult
and we also know that one essential step on our journey is to control the spiraling cost of health care in america
and in order to do that, we're going to need the help of the ama
today, we are spending over $2 trillion a year on health care   almost 50 percent more per person than the next most costly nation
and yet, as i think many of you are aware, for all of this spending, more of our citizens are uninsured, the quality of our care is often lower, and we aren't any healthier
in fact, citizens in some countries that spend substantially less than we do are actually living longer than we do
make no mistake
the cost of our health care is a threat to our economy
it's an escalating burden on our families and businesses
it's a ticking time bomb for the federal budget
and it is unsustainable for the united states of america
it's unsustainable for americans like laura klitzka, a young mother that i met in wisconsin just last week, who's learned that the breast cancer she thought she'd beaten had spread to her bones, but who's now being forced to spend time worrying about how to cover the $50,000 in medical debts she's already accumulated, worried about future debts that she's going to accumulate, when all she wants to do is spend time with her two children and focus on getting well
these are not the worries that a woman like laura should have to face in a nation as wealthy as ours
stories like laura's are being told by women and men all across this country   by families who've seen out-of-pocket costs soar, and premiums double over the last decade at a rate three times faster than wages
this is forcing americans of all ages to go without the checkups or the prescriptions they need   that you know they need
it's creating a situation where a single illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings
our costly health care system is unsustainable for doctors like michael kahn in new hampshire, who, as he puts it, spends 20 percent of each day supervising a staff explaining insurance problems to patients, completing authorization forms, writing appeal letters   a routine that he calls disruptive and distracting, giving him less time to do what he became a doctor to do and actually care for his patients
small business owners like chris and becky link in nashville are also struggling
they've always wanted to do right by the workers at their family-run marketing firm, but they've recently had to do the unthinkable and lay off a number of employees   layoffs that could have been deferred, they say, if health care costs weren't so high
across the country, over one-third of small businesses have reduced benefits in recent years and one-third have dropped their workers' coverage altogether since the early '90s
our largest companies are suffering, as well
a big part of what led general motors and chrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they racked up providing health care for their workers   costs that made them less profitable and less competitive with automakers around the world
if we do not fix our health care system, america may go the way of gm   paying more, getting less, and going broke
when it comes to the cost of our health care, then, the status quo is unsustainable
so reform is not a luxury
it is a necessity
when i hear people say, well, why are you taking this on right now, you've got all these other problems, i keep on reminding people i'd love to be able to defer these issues, but we can't
i know there's been much discussion about what reform would cost, and rightly so
this is a test of whether we   democrats and republicans alike   are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline
but let there be no doubt   the cost of inaction is greater
if we fail to act   if we fail to act   and you know this because you see it in your own individual practices   if we fail to act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more americans   all of which will affect your practice
if we fail to act, one out of every five dollars we earn will be spent on health care within a decade
and in 30 years, it will be about one out of every three   a trend that will mean lost jobs, lower take-home pay, shuttered businesses, and a lower standard of living for all americans
and if we fail to act, federal spending on medicaid and medicare will grow over the coming decades by an amount almost equal to the amount our government currently spends on our nation's defense
it will, in fact, eventually grow larger than what our government spends on anything else today
it's a scenario that will swamp our federal and state budgets, and impose a vicious choice of either unprecedented tax hikes, or overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts in our federal and state budgets
so to say it as plainly as i can, health care is the single most important thing we can do for america's long-term fiscal health
that is a fact
that's a fact
it's a fact, and the truth is most people know that it's a fact
and yet, as clear as it is that our system badly needs reform, reform is not inevitable
there's a sense out there among some, and perhaps some members who are gathered here today of the ama, that as bad as our current system may be   and it's pretty bad   the devil we know is better than the devil we don't
there's a fear of change   a worry that we may lose what works about our health care system while trying to fix what doesn't
i'm here to tell you i understand that fear
and i understand the cynicism
they're scars left over from past efforts at reform
after all, presidents have called for health care reform for nearly a century
teddy roosevelt called for it
harry truman called for it
richard nixon called for it
jimmy carter called for it
bill clinton called for it
but while significant individual reforms have been made   such as medicare, medicaid, and the children's health insurance program   efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down costs have largely failed
part of the reason is because the different groups involved   doctors, insurance companies, businesses, workers, and others   simply couldn't agree on the need for reform or what shape it would take
and if we're honest, another part of the reason has been the fierce opposition fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists   opposition that has used fear tactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an attempt to, yes, socialize medicine
and despite this long history of failure, i'm standing here because i think we're in a different time
one sign that things are different is that just this past week, the senate passed a bill that will protect children from the dangers of smoking, a reform the ama has long championed   this organization long championed
it went nowhere when it was proposed a decade ago   i'm going to sign this into law
now, what makes this moment different is that this time   for the first time   key stakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform
they're coming out   they're coming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health care community to do their part   everybody is going to have to pitch in   ultimately, everybody will benefit
and i want to commend the ama, in particular, for offering to do your part to curb costs and achieve reform
just a week ago, you joined together with hospitals, labor unions, insurers, medical device manufacturers and drug companies to do something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago   you promised to work together to cut national health care spending by $2 trillion over the next decade, relative to what it would have otherwise been
and that will bring down costs
that will bring down premiums
that's exactly the kind of cooperation we need, and we appreciate that very much
thank you
now, the question is how do we finish the job
how do we permanently bring down costs and make quality, affordable health care available to every single american
that's what i've come to talk about today
we know the moment is right for health care reform
we know this is a historic opportunity we've never seen before and may not see again
but we also know that there are those who will try and scuttle this opportunity no matter what   who will use the same scare tactics and fear-mongering that's worked in the past
who will give warnings about socialized medicine and government takeovers, long lines and rationed care, decisions made by bureaucrats and not doctors
we have heard this all before
and because these fear tactics have worked, things have kept getting worse
so let me begin by saying this to you and to the american people
i know that there are millions of americans who are content with their health care coverage   they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor
they trust you
and that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the american people
if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period
if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period
no one will take it away, no matter what
my view is that health care reform should be guided by a simple principle
fix what's broken and build on what works
and that's what we intend to do
if we do that, we can build a health care system that allows you to be physicians instead of administrators and accountants
a system that gives americans   a system that gives americans the best care at the lowest cost
a system that eases up the pressure on businesses and unleashes the promise of our economy, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, making take-home wages thousands of dollars higher, and growing our economy by tens of billions of dollars more every year
that's how we'll stop spending tax dollars to prop up an unsustainable system, and start investing those dollars in innovations and advances that will make our health care system and our economy stronger
that's what we can do with this opportunity
and that's what we must do with this moment
now, the good news is that in some instances, there's already widespread agreement on the steps necessary to make our health care system work better
first, we need to upgrade our medical records by switching from a paper to an electronic system of record keeping
and we've already begun to do this with an investment we made as part of our recovery act
it simply doesn't make sense that patients in the 21st century are still filling out forms with pens on papers that have to be stored away somewhere
as newt gingrich has rightly pointed out   and i don't quote newt gingrich that often   we do a better job tracking a fedex package in this country than we do tracking patients' health records
you shouldn't have to tell every new doctor you see about your medical history or what prescriptions you're taking
you shouldn't have to repeat costly tests
all that information should be stored securely in a private medical record so that your information can be tracked from one doctor to another   even if you change jobs, even if you move, even if you have to see a number of different specialists
that's just common sense
and that will not only mean less paper-pushing and lower administrative costs, saving taxpayers billions of dollars
it will also mean all of you physicians will have an easier time doing your jobs
it will tell you, the doctors, what drugs a patient is taking so you can avoid prescribing a medication that could cause a harmful interaction
it will prevent the wrong dosages from going to a patient
it will reduce medical errors, it's estimated, that lead to 100,000 lives lost unnecessarily in our hospitals every year
so there shouldn't be an argument there
and we want to make sure that we're helping providers computerize so that we can get this system up and running
the second step that we can all agree on is to invest more in preventive care so we can avoid illness and disease in the first place
that starts with each of us taking more responsibility for our health and for the health of our children
it means quitting smoking
it means going in for that mammogram or colon cancer screening
it means going for a run or hitting the gym, and raising our children to step away from the video games and spend more time playing outside
it also means cutting down on all the junk food that's fueling an epidemic of obesity   which puts far too many americans, young and old, at greater risk of costly, chronic conditions
that's a lesson michelle and i have tried to instill in our daughters
as some of you know, we started a white house vegetable garden
i say we generously, because michelle has done most of the work
that's a lesson that we should work with local school districts to incorporate into their school lunch programs
building a health care system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseases will require all of us to do our parts
it will take doctors telling us what risk factors we should avoid and what preventive measures we should pursue
it will take employers following the example of places like safeway that is rewarding workers for taking better care of their health while reducing health care costs in the process
if you're one of three-quarters of safeway workers enrolled in their healthy measures program, you can get screened for problems like high cholesterol or high blood pressure
and if you score well, you can pay lower premiums
you get more money in your paycheck
it's a program that has helped safeway cut health care spending by 13 percent, and workers save over 20 percent on their premiums
and we're open to doing more to help employers adopt and expand programs like this one
our federal government also has to step up its efforts to advance the cause of healthy living
five of the costliest illnesses and conditions   cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, and strokes   can be prevented
and yet only a fraction of every health care dollar goes to prevention or public health
and that's starting to change with an investment we're making in prevention and wellness programs that can help us avoid disease that harm our health and the health of our economy
but as important as they are, investments in electronic records and preventive care, all the things that i've just mentioned, they're just preliminary steps
they will only make a dent in the epidemic of rising costs in this country
despite what some have suggested, the reason we have these spiraling costs is not simply because we've got an aging population
demographics do account for part of rising costs because older, sicker societies pay more on health care than younger, healthier ones, and there's nothing intrinsically wrong in us taking better care of ourselves
but what accounts for the bulk of our costs is the nature of our health care delivery system itself   a system where we spend vast amounts of money on things that aren't necessarily making our people any healthier
a system that automatically equates more expensive care with better care
now, a recent article in the new yorker, for example, showed how mcallen, texas, is spending twice as much as el paso county   twice as much   not because people in mcallen, texas, are sicker than they are in el paso
not because they're getting better care or getting better outcomes
it's simply because they're using more treatments   treatments that, in some cases, they don't really need
treatments that, in some cases, can actually do people harm by raising the risk of infection or medical error
and the problem is this pattern is repeating itself across america
one dartmouth study shows that you're less likely   you're no less likely to die from a heart attack and other ailments in a higher-spending area than in a lower-spending one
there are two main reasons for this
the first is a system of incentives where the more tests and services are provided, the more money we pay
and a lot of people in this room know what i'm talking about
it's a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care
that pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you can't spend much time with each, and gives you every incentive to order that extra mri or ekg, even if it's not necessary
it's a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession   a calling   to a business
that's not why you became doctors
that's not why you put in all those hours in the anatomy suite or the o
that's not what brings you back to a patient's bedside to check in, or makes you call a loved one of a patient to say it will be fine
you didn't enter this profession to be bean-counters and paper-pushers
you entered this profession to be healers
and that's what our health care system should let you be
that's what this health care system should let you be
now, that starts with reforming the way we compensate our providers   doctors and hospitals
we need to bundle payments so you aren't paid for every single treatment you offer a patient with a chronic condition like diabetes, but instead paid well for how you treat the overall disease
we need to create incentives for physicians to team up, because we know that when that happens, it results in a healthier patient
we need to give doctors bonuses for good health outcomes, so we're not promoting just more treatment, but better care
and we need to rethink the cost of a medical education, and do more to reward medical students who choose a career as a primary care physician   who choose to work in underserved areas instead of the more lucrative paths
that's why we're making a substantial investment in the national health service corps that will make medical training more affordable for primary care doctors and nurse practitioners so they aren't drowning in debt when they enter the workforce
somebody back there is drowning in debt
the second structural reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medical information making its way to doctors and patients
we have the best medical schools, the most sophisticated labs, the most advanced training of any nation on the globe
yet we're not doing a very good job harnessing our collective knowledge and experience on behalf of better medicine
less than 1 percent of our health care spending goes to examining what treatments are most effective   less than 1 percent
and even when that information finds its way into journals, it can take up to 17 years to find its way to an exam room or operating table
as a result, too many doctors and patients are making decisions without the benefit of the latest research
a recent study, for example, found that only half of all cardiac guidelines are based on scientific evidence   half
that means doctors may be doing a bypass operation when placing a stent is equally effective
or placing a stent when adjusting a patient's drug and medical management is equally effective   all of which drives up costs without improving a patient's health
so one thing we need to do is to figure out what works, and encourage rapid implementation of what works into your practices
that's why we're making a major investment in research to identify the best treatments for a variety of ailments and conditions
now, let me be clear   i just want to clear something up here   identifying what works is not about dictating what kind of care should be provided
it's about providing patients and doctors with the information they need to make the best medical decisions
see, i have the assumption that if you have good information about what makes your patients well, that's what you're going to do
i have confidence in that
we're not going to need to force you to do it
we just need to make sure you've got the best information available
still, even when we do know what works, we are often not making the most of it
and that's why we need to build on the examples of outstanding medicine at places like the cincinnati children's hospital, where the quality of care for cystic fibrosis patients shot up after the hospital began incorporating suggestions from parents
and places like tallahassee memorial health care, where deaths were dramatically reduced with rapid response teams that monitored patients' conditions, and multidisciplinary rounds with everyone from physicians to pharmacists
and places like geisinger health system in rural pennsylvania, and intermountain health in salt lake city, where high-quality care is being provided at a cost well below the national average
these are all islands of excellence that we need to make the standard in our health care system
so replicating best practices, incentivizing excellence, closing cost disparities   any legislation sent to my desk that does not these   does not achieve these goals in my mind does not earn the title of reform
but my signature on a bill is not enough
i need your help, doctors, because to most americans you are the health care system
the fact is americans   and i include myself and michelle and our kids in this   we just do what you tell us to do
that's what we do
we listen to you, we trust you
and that's why i will listen to you and work with you to pursue reform that works for you
together, if we take all these steps, i am convinced we can bring spending down, bring quality up
we can save hundreds of billions of dollars on health care costs while making our health care system work better for patients and doctors alike
and when we align the interests of patients and doctors, then we're going to be in a good place
now, i recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits
i recognize that
don't get too excited yet
now, i understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable
that's a real issue
now, just hold on to your horses here, guys
i want to be honest with you
i'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards   which i personally believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully harmed
but i do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first
how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine
how to encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines
i want to work with the ama so we can scale back the excessive defensive medicine that reinforces our current system, and shift to a system where we are providing better care, simply   rather than simply more treatment
so this is going to be a priority for me
and i know, based on your responses, it's a priority for you
and i look forward to working with you
and it's going to be difficult
but all this stuff is going to be difficult
all of it's going to be important
now, i know this has been a long speech, but we got more to do
the changes that i have already spoken about, all that is going to need to go hand-in-hand with other reforms
because our health care system is so complex and medicine is always evolving, we need a way to continually evaluate how we can eliminate waste, reduce costs, and improve quality
that's why i'm open to expanding the role of a commission created by a republican congress called the medicare payment advisory commission, which happens to include a number of physicians on the commission
in recent years, this commission proposed roughly $200 billion in savings that never made it into law
these recommendations have now been incorporated into our broader reform agenda, but we need to fast-track their proposals, the commission's proposals, in the future so that we don't miss another opportunity to save billions of dollars, as we gain more information about what works and what doesn't work in our health care system
and as we seek to contain the cost of health care, we also have to ensure that every american can get coverage they can afford
we must do so in part because it's in all of our economic interests
each time an uninsured american steps foot into an emergency room with no way to reimburse the hospital for care, the cost is handed over to every american family as a bill of about $1,000 that's reflected in higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher health care costs
it's a hidden tax, a hidden bill that will be cut as we insure all americans
and as we insure every young and healthy american, it will spread out risk for insurance companies, further reducing costs for everyone
but alongside these economic arguments, there's another, more powerful one
and it is simply this
we are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women and children
we are not a nation that lets hardworking families go without coverage, or turns its back on those in need
we're a nation that cares for its citizens
we look out for one another
that's what makes us the united states of america
we need to get this done
so we need to do a few things to provide affordable health insurance to every single american
the first thing we need to do is to protect what's working in our health care system
so just in case you didn't catch it the first time, let me repeat
if you like your health care system and your doctor, the only thing reform will mean to you is your health care will cost less
if anyone says otherwise, they are either trying to mislead you or don't have their facts straight
now, if you don't like your health care coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'll have a chance, under what we've proposed, to take part in what we're calling a health insurance exchange
this exchange will allow you to one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose a plan that's best for you and your family   the same way, by the way, that federal employees can do, from a postal worker to a member of congress
you will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages, but every plan would offer an affordable, basic package
again, this is for people who aren't happy with their current plan
if you like what you're getting, keep it
nobody is forcing you to shift
but if you're not, this gives you some new options
and i believe one of these options needs to be a public option that will give people a broader range of choices   and inject competition into the health care market so that force   so that we can force waste out of the system and keep the insurance companies honest
now, i know that there's some concern about a public option
even within this organization there's healthy debate about it
in particular, i understand that you're concerned that today's medicare rates, which many of you already feel are too low, will be applied broadly in a way that means our cost savings are coming off your backs
and these are legitimate concerns, but they're ones, i believe, that can be overcome
as i stated earlier, the reforms we propose to reimbursement are to reward best practices, focus on patient care, not on the current piecework reimbursements
what we seek is more stability and a health care system that's on a sounder financial footing
and the fact is these reforms need to take place regardless of whether there's a public option or not
with reform, we will ensure that you are being reimbursed in a thoughtful way that's tied to patient outcomes, instead of relying on yearly negotiations about the sustainable growth rate formula that's based on politics and the immediate state of the federal budget in any given year
and i just want to point out the alternative to such reform is a world where health care costs grow at an unsustainable rate
and if you don't think that's going to threaten your reimbursements and the stability of our health care system, you haven't been paying attention
so the public option is not your enemy
it is your friend, i believe
let me also say that   let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward by those who are claiming that a public option is somehow a trojan horse for a single-payer system
i'll be honest
there are countries where a single-payer system works pretty well
but i believe   and i've taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief   that it's important for our reform efforts to build on our traditions here in the united states
so when you hear the naysayers claim that i'm trying to bring about government-run health care, know this
they're not telling the truth
what i am trying to do   and what a public option will help do   is put affordable health care within reach for millions of americans
and to help ensure that everyone can afford the cost of a health care option in our exchange, we need to provide assistance to families who need it
that way, there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain uninsured
indeed, it's because i'm confident in our ability to give people the ability to get insurance at an affordable rate that i'm open to a system where every american bears responsibility for owning health insurance   so long as we provide a hardship waiver for those who still can't afford it as we move towards this system
the same is true for employers
while i believe every business has a responsibility to provide health insurance for its workers, small businesses that can't afford it should receive an exemption
and small business workers and their families will be able to seek coverage in the exchange if their employer is not able to provide it
now, here's some good news
insurance companies have expressed support for the idea of covering the uninsured and they certainly are in favor of a mandate
i welcome their willingness to engage constructively in the reform debate
i'm glad they're at the table
but what i refuse to do is simply create a system where insurance companies suddenly have a whole bunch of more customers on uncle sam's dime, but still fail to meet their responsibilities
we're not going to do that
let me give you an example of what i'm talking about
we need to end the practice of denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions
the days of cherry-picking who to cover and who to deny, those days are over
i know you see it in your practices, and how incredibly painful and frustrating it is   you want to give somebody care and you find out that the insurance companies are wiggling out of paying
this is personal for me also
i've told this story before
i'll never forget watching my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final days, spending time worrying about whether her insurer would claim her illness was a preexisting condition so it could get out of providing coverage
changing the current approach to preexisting conditions is the least we can do   for my mother and for every other mother, father, son, and daughter, who has suffered under this practice, who've been paying premiums and don't get care
we need to put health care within the reach for millions of americans
now, even if we accept all of the economic and moral reasons for providing affordable coverage to all americans, there is no denying that expanding coverage will come at a cost, at least in the short run
but it is a cost that will not   i repeat   will not add to our deficits
i've set down a rule for my staff, for my team   and i've said this to congress   health care reform must be, and will be, deficit-neutral in the next decade
now, there are already voices saying the numbers don't add up
they're wrong
here's why
making health care affordable for all americans will cost somewhere on the order of $1 trillion over the next 10 years
that's real money, even in washington
but remember, that's less than we are projected to have spent on the war in iraq
and also remember, failing to reform our health care system in a way that genuinely reduces cost growth will cost us trillions of dollars more in lost economic growth and lower wages
that said, let me explain how we will cover the price tag
first, as part of the budget that was passed a few months ago, we put aside $635 billion over 10 years in what we're calling a health reserve fund
over half of that amount   more than $300 billion   will come from raising revenue by doing things like modestly limiting the tax deductions the wealthiest americans can take to the same level that it was at the end of the reagan years   same level that it was under ronald reagan
some are concerned that this will dramatically reduce charitable giving, for example, but statistics show that's not true
and the best thing for our charities is the stronger economy that we will build with health care reform
but we can't just raise revenues
we're also going to have to make spending cuts, in part by examining inefficiencies in our current medicare program
there are going to be robust debates about where these cuts should be made, and i welcome that debate
but here's where i think these cuts should be made
first, we should end overpayments to medicare advantage
today, we're paying medicare advantage plans much more than we pay for traditional medicare services
now, this is a good deal for insurance companies
it's a subsidy to insurance companies
it's not a good deal for you
it's not a good deal for the american people
and by the way, it doesn't follow free market principles, for those who are always talking about free market principles
that's why we need to introduce competitive bidding into the medicare advantage program, a program under which private insurance companies are offering medicare coverage
that alone will save $177 billion over the next decade, just that one step
second, we need to use medicare reimbursements to reduce preventable hospital readmissions
right now, almost 20 percent of medicare patients discharged from hospitals are readmitted within a month, often because they're not getting the comprehensive care that they need
this puts people at risk
it drives up cost
by changing how medicare reimburses hospitals, we can discourage them from acting in a way that boosts profits but drives up costs for everyone else
that will save us $25 billion over the next decade
third, we need to introduce generic biologic drugs into the marketplace
these are drugs used to treat illnesses like anemia
but right now, there is no pathway at the fda for approving generic versions of these drugs
creating such a pathway will save us billions of dollars
we can save another roughly $30 billion by getting a better deal for our poorer seniors while asking our well-off seniors to pay a little more for their drugs
so that's the bulk of what's in the health reserve fund
i've also proposed saving another $313 billion in medicare and medicaid spending in several other ways
one way is by adjusting medicare payments to reflect new advances and productivity gains in our economy
right now, medicare payments are rising each year by more than they should
these adjustments will create incentives for providers to deliver care more efficiently, and save us roughly $109 billion in the process
another way we can achieve savings is by reducing payments to hospitals for treating uninsured people
i know hospitals rely on these payments now, legitimately, because of the large number of uninsured patients that they treat
but if we put in a system where people have coverage and the number of uninsured people goes down with our reforms, the amount we pay hospitals to treat uninsured people should go down, as well
reducing these payments gradually, as more and more people have coverage, will save us over $106 billion
and we'll make sure the difference goes to the hospitals that need it most
we can also save about $75 billion through more efficient purchasing of prescription drugs
and we can save about $1 billion more by rooting out waste, abuse, fraud throughout our health care system so that no one is charging more for a service than it's worth or charging a dime for a service that they don't provide
let me be clear
i'm committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our senior citizens
in fact, these proposals will actually extend the life of the medicare trust fund by seven years, and reduce premiums for medicare beneficiaries by roughly $43 billion over the next 10 years
and i'm working with aarp to uphold that commitment
now, for those of you who took out your pencil and paper   altogether, these savings mean that we've put about $950 billion on the table   and that doesn't count some of the long-term savings that we think will come about from reform   from medical it, for example, or increased investment in prevention
so that stuff in congressional jargon is not scorable
the congressional budget office won't count that as savings, so we're setting that aside
we think that's going to come, but even separate and far from that, we've put $950 billion on the table, taking us almost all the way to covering the full cost of health care reform
in the weeks and months ahead, i look forward to working with congress to make up the difference so that health care reform is fully paid for   in a real, accountable way
and let me add that this does not count longer-term savings
i just want to repeat that
by insisting that the reforms that we're introducing are deficit-neutral over the next decade, and by making the reforms that will help slow the growth rate of health care costs over the coming decades   bending the curve   we can look forward to faster economic growth, higher living standards, and falling, instead of rising, budget deficits
now, let me just wrap up by saying this
i know people are cynical whether we can do this or not
i know there will be disagreements about how to proceed in the days ahead
there's probably healthy debate within the ama
that's good
i also know this
we can't let this moment pass us by
you know, the other day, a friend of mine, congressman earl blumenauer, handed me a magazine with a special issue titled, the crisis in american medicine
one article notes soaring charges
another warns about the volume of utilization of services
another asks if we can find a better way than fee-for-service for paying for medical care
it speaks to many of the challenges we face today
the thing is, this special issue was published by harper's magazine in october of 1960   before i was born
members of the american medical association, and my fellow americans, i'm here today because i don't want our children and their children to still be speaking of a crisis in american medicine 50 years from now
i don't want them to still be suffering from spiraling costs that we did not stem, or sicknesses that we did not cure
i don't want them to be burdened with massive deficits we did not curb or a worsening economy that we did not rebuild
i want them to benefit from a health care system that works for all of us
where families can open a doctor's bill without dreading what's inside
where parents are talking to their kids and getting them to get regular checkups, and testing themselves for preventable ailments
where parents are feeding their kids healthier food and kids are exercising more
where patients are spending more time with their doctors, and doctors can pull up on a computer all the medical information and latest research they'll ever want to know to meet patients' needs
where orthopedists and nephrologists and oncologists are all working together to treat a single human being
where what's best about america's health care system has become the hallmark of america's health care system
that's the health care system we can build
that's the future i'm convinced is within our reach
and if we're willing to come together and bring about that future, then we will not only make americans healthier, we will not only unleash america's economic potential, but we will reaffirm the ideals that led you into this noble profession and we'll build a health care system that lets all americans heal
thank you very much, ama
appreciate it, thank you
good afternoon
thank you, president sarkozy, prime minister brown, prime minister harper, and prince charles for being here today
thank you to our secretary of veterans affairs, general eric shinseki, for making the trip out here to join us
thanks also to susan eisenhower, whose grandfather began this mission 65 years ago with a simple charge
ok, let's go
and to a world war ii veteran who returned home from this war to serve a proud and distinguished career as a united states senator and a national leader
bob dole
i'm not the first american president to come and mark this anniversary, and i likely will not be the last
this is an event that has long brought to this coast both heads of state and grateful citizens
veterans and their loved ones
the liberated and their liberators
it's been written about and spoken of and depicted in countless books and films and speeches
and long after our time on this earth has passed, one word will still bring forth the pride and awe of men and women who will never meet the heroes who sit before us
d-day
why is this
of all the battles in all the wars across the span of human history, why does this day hold such a revered place in our memory
what is it about the struggle that took place on the sands a few short steps from here that brings us back to remember year after year after year
part of it, i think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success
for three centuries, no invader had ever been able to cross the english channel into normandy
and it had never been more difficult than in 1944
that was the year that hitler ordered his top field marshal to fortify the atlantic wall against a seaborne invasion
from the tip of norway to southern france, the nazis lined steep cliffs with machine guns and artillery
low-lying areas were flooded to block passage
sharpened poles awaited paratroopers
mines were laid on the beaches and beneath the water
and by the time of the invasion, half a million germans waited for the allies along the coast between holland and northern france
at dawn on june 6th, the allies came
the best chance for victory had been for the british royal air corps to take out the guns on the cliffs while airborne divisions parachuted behind enemy lines
but all did not go according to plan
paratroopers landed miles from their mark, while the fog and clouds prevented allied planes from destroying the guns on the cliffs
so when the ships landed here at omaha, an unimaginable hell rained down on the men inside
many never made it out of the boats
and yet, despite all of this, one by one, the allied forces made their way to shore   here, and at utah and juno
gold and sword
they were american, british, and canadian
soon, the paratroopers found each other and fought their way back
the rangers scaled the cliffs
and by the end of the day, against all odds, the ground on which we stand was free once more
the sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes d-day so memorable
it also arises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged
we live in a world of competing beliefs and claims about what is true
it's a world of varied religions and cultures and forms of government
in such a world, it's all too rare for a struggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity
the second world war did that
no man who shed blood or lost a brother would say that war is good
but all know that this war was essential
for what we faced in nazi totalitarianism was not just a battle of competing interests
it was a competing vision of humanity
nazi ideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate
it perpetrated murder on a massive scale, fueled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior
it was evil
the nations that joined together to defeat hitler's reich were not perfect
they had made their share of mistakes, had not always agreed with one another on every issue
but whatever god we prayed to, whatever our differences, we knew that the evil we faced had to be stopped
citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain as bystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction
and so we joined and sent our sons to fight and often die so that men and women they never met might know what it is to be free
in america, it was an endeavor that inspired a nation to action
a president who asked his country to pray on d-day also asked its citizens to serve and sacrifice to make the invasion possible
on farms and in factories, millions of men and women worked three shifts a day, month after month, year after year
trucks and tanks came from plants in michigan and indiana, new york and illinois
bombers and fighter planes rolled off assembly lines in ohio and kansas, where my grandmother did her part as an inspector
shipyards on both coasts produced the largest fleet in history, including the landing craft from new orleans that eventually made it here to omaha
but despite all the years of planning and preparation, despite the inspiration of our leaders, the skill of our generals, the strength of our firepower and the unyielding support from our home front, the outcome of the entire struggle would ultimately rest on the success of one day in june
lyndon johnson once said that there are certain moments when ¼history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom
d-day was such a moment
one newspaper noted that we have come to the hour for which we were born
had the allies failed here, hitler's occupation of this continent might have continued indefinitely
instead, victory here secured a foothold in france
it opened a path to berlin
it made possible the achievements that followed the liberation of europe
the marshall plan, the nato alliance, the shared prosperity and security that flowed from each
it was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, on both sides of the atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long and two miles wide
more particularly, it came down to the men who landed here   those who now rest in this place for eternity, and those who are with us here today
perhaps more than any other reason, you, the veterans of that landing, are why we still remember what happened on d-day
you're why we keep coming back
for you remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond our control
you remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance
our history has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by each individual man and woman
it has always been up to us
you could have done what hitler believed you would do when you arrived here
in the face of a merciless assault from these cliffs, you could have idled the boats offshore
amid a barrage of tracer bullets that lit the night sky, you could have stayed in those planes
you could have hid in the hedgerows or waited behind the seawall
you could have done only what was necessary to ensure your own survival
but that's not what you did
that's not the story you told on d-day
your story was written by men like zane schlemmer of the 82nd airborne, who parachuted into a dark marsh, far from his objective and his men
lost and alone, he still managed to fight his way through the gunfire and help liberate the town in which he landed   a town where a street now bears his name
it's a story written by men like anthony ruggiero, an army ranger who saw half the men on his landing craft drown when it was hit by shellfire just a thousand yards off this beach
he spent three hours in freezing water, and was one of only 90 rangers to survive out of the 225 who were sent to scale the cliffs
and it's a story written by so many who are no longer with us, like carlton barrett
private barrett was only supposed to serve as a guide for the 1st infantry division, but he instead became one of its heroes
after wading ashore in neck-deep water, he returned to the water again and again and again to save his wounded and drowning comrades
and under the heaviest possible enemy fire, he carried them to safety
he carried them in his own arms
this is the story of the allied victory
it's the legend of units like easy company and the all-american 82nd
it's the tale of the british people, whose courage during the blitz forced hitler to call off the invasion of england
the canadians, who came even though they were never attacked
the russians, who sustained some of the war's heaviest casualties on the eastern front
and all those french men and women who would rather have died resisting tyranny than lived within its grasp
it is the memories that have been passed on to so many of us about the service or sacrifice of a friend or relative
for me, it is my grandfather, stanley dunham, who arrived on this beach six weeks after d-day and marched across europe in patton's army
and it is my great uncle who was part of the first american division to reach and liberate a nazi concentration camp
his name is charles payne, and i'm so proud that he's with us here today
i know this trip doesn't get any easier as the years pass, but for those of you who make it, there's nothing that could keep you away
one such veteran, a man named jim norene, was a member of the 502nd parachute infantry division of the 101st airborne
last night, after visiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep
jim was gravely ill when he left his home, and he knew that he might not return
but just as he did 65 years ago, he came anyway
may he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his family always find solace in the heroism he showed here
in the end, jim norene came back to normandy for the same reason we all come back
he came for the reason articulated by howard huebner, another former paratrooper who is here with us today
when asked why he made the trip, howard said, it's important that we tell our stories
it doesn't have to be something big¼just a little story about what happened   so people don't forget
so people don't forget
friends and veterans, we cannot forget
what we must not forget is that d-day was a time and a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course of an entire century
at an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary
they fought for their moms and sweethearts back home, for the fellow warriors they came to know as brothers
and they fought out of a simple sense of duty   a duty sustained by the same ideals for which their countrymen had once fought and bled for over two centuries
that is the story of normandy   but also the story of america
of the minutemen who gathered on a green in lexington
of the union boys from maine who repelled a charge at gettysburg
of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at inchon and khe san
of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice
it's a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives us hope
for as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time, and arrive at that hour for which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in history when the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a beachhead on an unforgiving shore
to those men who achieved that victory 65 years ago, we thank you for your service
may god bless you, and may god bless the memory of all those who rest here
chancellor merkel and i have just finished our tour here at buchenwald
i want to thank dr
volkhard knigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing
i am particularly grateful to be accompanied by my friend elie wiesel, as well as mr
bertrand herz, both of whom are survivors of this place
we saw the area known as little camp where elie and bertrand were sent as boys
in fact, at the place that commemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old elie in one of the bunks along with the others
we saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, the foundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions
we saw the memorial to all the survivors   a steel plate, as chancellor merkel said, that is heated to 37 degrees celsius, the temperature of the human body
a reminder   where people were deemed inhuman because of their differences   of the mark that we all share
now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time
as we were walking up, elie said, if these trees could talk
and there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror that took place here
more than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished
i will not forget what i've seen here today
i've known about this place since i was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very young man serving in world war ii
he was part of the 89th infantry division, the first americans to reach a concentration camp
they liberated ohrdruf, one of buchenwald's sub-camps
and i told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself for months on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head
and as we see   as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed what had taken place here would be in a state of shock
my great uncle's commander, general eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence
he had seen the piles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the american soldiers found when they arrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them or be able   be unable to find the words to describe them
that they might be rendered mute in the way my great uncle had
and he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies had been taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it
and that's why he ordered american troops and germans from the nearby town to tour the camp
he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made
and he insisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that   and i quote   he could be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda
we are here today because we know this work is not yet finished
to this day, there are those who insist that the holocaust never happened   a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful
this place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts
a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history
also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance   racism, anti-semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more   hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all
in this century, we've seen genocide
we've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground
children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war
this places teaches us that we must be ever vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering is not our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their own interests
but as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're also reminded of the human capacity for good
for amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, we know that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well
the jews who insisted on fasting on yom kippur
the camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellow inmates, risking his own life to help save theirs
the prisoners who organized a special effort to protect the children here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food
they set up secret classrooms, some of the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions
and we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistance was in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there
and so out of the filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive
when the american gis arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still alive, and the youngest was just three years old
and i'm told that a couple of the prisoners even wrote a buchenwald song that many here sang
among the lyrics were these
whatever our fate, we will say yes to life, for the day will come when we are free
in our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts   faith
these individuals never could have known the world would one day speak of this place
they could not have known that some of them would live to have children and grandchildren who would grow up hearing their stories and would return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and the clock tower set permanently to 3
15, the moment of liberation
they could not have known how the nation of israel would rise out of the destruction of the holocaust and the strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own
and they could not have known that one day an american president would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing side by side with the german chancellor in a germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued american ally
they could not have known these things
but still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast to life
in their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowable it arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them
and it is now up to us, the living, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain
it is up to us to redeem that faith
it is up to us to bear witness
to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here
to remember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us
and just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us i think to remember that the perpetrators of such evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves
and i want to express particular thanks to chancellor merkel and the german people, because it's not easy to look into the past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will stand guard against acts like this happening again
rather than have me end with my remarks i thought it was appropriate to have elie wiesel provide some reflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died
thank you so much
good afternoon
i am honored to be in the timeless city of cairo, and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions
for over a thousand years, al-azhar has stood as a beacon of islamic learning
and for over a century, cairo university has been a source of egypt's advancement
and together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress
i'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of egypt
and i'm also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the american people, and a greeting of peace from muslim communities in my country
assalaamu alaykum
we meet at a time of great tension between the united states and muslims around the world, tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate
the relationship between islam and the west includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars
more recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many muslims, and a cold war in which muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations
moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many muslims to view the west as hostile to the traditions of islam
violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of muslims
the attacks of september 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view islam as inevitably hostile not only to america and western countries, but also to human rights
all this has bred more fear and more mistrust
so long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity
and this cycle of suspicion and discord must end
i've come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the united states and muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that america and islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition
instead, they overlap and share common principles   principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings
i do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight
i know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can i answer in the time that i have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point
but i am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors
there must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground
as the holy qur'an tells us, be conscious of god and speak always the truth
that is what i will try to do today   to speak the truth as best i can, humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart
now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience
i'm a christian, but my father came from a kenyan family that includes generations of muslims
as a boy, i spent several years in indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk
as a young man, i worked in chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their muslim faith
as a student of history, i also know civilization's debt to islam
it was islam   at places like al-azhar   that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for europe's renaissance and enlightenment
it was innovation in muslim communities   it was innovation in muslim communities that developed the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery of pens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed
islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires
timeless poetry and cherished music
elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation
and throughout history, islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality
i also know that islam has always been a part of america's story
the first nation to recognize my country was morocco
in signing the treaty of tripoli in 1796, our second president, john adams, wrote, the united states has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of muslims
and since our founding, american muslims have enriched the united states
they have fought in our wars
they have served in our government
they have stood for civil rights
they have started businesses
they have taught at our universities
they've excelled in our sports arenas
they've won nobel prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the olympic torch
and when the first muslim american was recently elected to congress, he took the oath to defend our constitution using the same holy qur'an that one of our founding fathers   thomas jefferson   kept in his personal library
so i have known islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed
that experience guides my conviction that partnership between america and islam must be based on what islam is, not what it isn't
and i consider it part of my responsibility as president of the united states to fight against negative stereotypes of islam wherever they appear
but, that same principle must apply to muslim perceptions of america
just as muslims   just as muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, america is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire
the united states has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known
we were born out of revolution against an empire
we were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal
and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words   within our borders and around the world
we are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the earth, and dedicated to a simple concept
e pluribus unum   out of many, one
now much has been made of the fact that an african american with the name barack hussein obama could be elected president
but my personal story is not so unique
the dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in america, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores   and that includes nearly 7 million american muslims in our country today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the american average
moreover, freedom in america is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion
that is why there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 mosques within our borders
that's why the united states government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab   and to punish those who would deny it
so let there be no doubt   let there be no doubt
islam is a part of america
and i believe that america holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations   to live in peace and security
to get an education and to work with dignity
to love our families, our communities, and our god
these things we share
this is the hope of all humanity
of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task
words alone cannot meet the needs of our people
these needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead, and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all
for we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere
when a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk
when one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations
when violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean
when innocents in bosnia and darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience
that is what it means to share this world in the 21st century
that is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings
and this is a difficult responsibility to embrace
for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes   and, yes, religions   subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests
yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating
given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail
so whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it
our problems must be dealt with through partnership
our progress must be shared
now, that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension
indeed, it suggests the opposite
we must face these tensions squarely
and so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as i can about some specific issues that i believe we must finally confront together
the first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms
in ankara, i made clear that america is not   and never will be   at war with islam
we will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security   because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject
the killing of innocent men, women, and children
and it is my first duty as president to protect the american people
the situation in afghanistan demonstrates america's goals, and our need to work together
over seven years ago, the united states pursued al qaeda and the taliban with broad international support
we did not go by choice
we went because of necessity
i'm aware that there's still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11
but let us be clear
al qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day
the victims were innocent men, women, and children from america and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody
and yet al qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale
they have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach
these are not opinions to be debated
these are facts to be dealt with
now, make no mistake
we do not want to keep our troops in afghanistan
we see no military   we seek no military bases there
it is agonizing for america to lose our young men and women
it is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict
we would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in afghanistan and now pakistan determined to kill as many americans as they possibly can
but that is not yet the case
and that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries
and despite the costs involved, america's commitment will not weaken
indeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists
they have killed in many countries
they have killed people of different faiths
but more than any other, they have killed muslims
their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with islam
the qur'an teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as   it is as if he has killed all mankind
and the holy qur'an also says whoever   whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind
the enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few
islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism   it is an important part of promoting peace
now, we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in afghanistan and pakistan
that's why we plan to invest 1
5 billion dollars each year over the next five years to partner with pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced
that's why we are providing more than 2
8 billion dollars to help afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on
let me also address the issue of iraq
unlike afghanistan, iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world
although i believe that the iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of saddam hussein, i also believe that events in iraq have reminded america of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible
indeed, we can recall the words of thomas jefferson, who said
i hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be
today, america has a dual responsibility
to help iraq forge a better future
and to leave iraq to iraqis
and i have made it clear to the iraqi people   i have made it clear to the iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources
iraq's sovereignty is its own
and that's why i ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next august
that is why we will honor our agreement with iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by july, and to remove all of our troops from iraq by 2012
we will help iraq train its security forces and develop its economy
but we will support a secure and united iraq as a partner, and never as a patron
and finally, just as america can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget our principles
nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country
the fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals
we are taking concrete actions to change course
i have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the united states, and i have ordered the prison at guantanamo bay closed by early next year
so america will defend itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law
and we will do so in partnership with muslim communities which are also threatened
the sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer
the second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between israelis, palestinians, and the arab world
america's strong bonds with israel are well known
this bond is unbreakable
it is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied
around the world, the jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-semitism in europe culminated in an unprecedented holocaust
tomorrow, i will visit buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed to death by the third reich
six million jews were killed   more than the entire jewish population of israel today
denying that fact is baseless
it is ignorant
and it is hateful
threatening israel with destruction, or repeating vile stereotypes about jews, is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve
on the other hand, it is also undeniable that the palestinian people   muslims and christians   has suffered in pursuit of a homeland
for more than 60 years they've endured the pain of dislocation
many wait in refugee camps in the west bank, gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead
they endure the daily humiliations   large and small   that come with occupation
so let there be no doubt
the situation for the palestinian people is intolerable
and america will not turn our backs on the legitimate palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own
for decades then, there has been a stalemate
two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive
it's easy to point fingers   for palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by israel's founding, and for israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond
but if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth
the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where israelis and palestinians each live in peace and security
that is in israel's interest, palestine's interest, america's interest, and the world's interest
and that is why i intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires
the obligations   the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear
for peace to come, it is time for them   and all of us   to live up to our responsibilities
palestinians must abandon violence
resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed
for centuries, black people in america suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation
but it was not violence that won full and equal rights
it was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of america's founding
this same story can be told by people from south africa to south asia
from eastern europe to indonesia
it's a story with a simple truth
violence is a dead end
it is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus
that's not how moral authority is claimed
that's how it is surrendered
now is the time for palestinians to focus on what they can build
the palestinian authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its peoples
hamas does have support among some palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities
to play a role in fulfilling palestinian aspirations, to unify the palestinian people, hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize israel's right to exist
at the same time, israelis must acknowledge that just as israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can palestine's
the united states does not accept the legitimacy of continued israeli settlements
this construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace
it is time for these settlements to stop
and israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that palestinians can live and work and develop their society
just as it devastates palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in gaza does not serve israel's security
neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the west bank
progress in the daily lives of the palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace, and israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress
and finally, the arab states must recognize that the arab peace initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities
the arab-israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of arab nations from other problems
instead, it must be a cause for action to help the palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past
america will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to israelis and palestinians and arabs
we cannot impose peace
but privately, many muslims recognize that israel will not go away
likewise, many israelis recognize the need for a palestinian state
it is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true
too many tears have been shed
too much blood has been shed
all of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of israelis and palestinians can see their children grow up without fear
when the holy land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that god intended it to be
when jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for jews and christians and muslims, and a place for all of the children of abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of isra   as in the story of isra, when moses, jesus, and mohammed, peace be upon them, joined in prayer
the third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons
this issue has been a source of tension between the united states and the islamic republic of iran
for many years, iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us
in the middle of the cold war, the united states played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected iranian government
since the islamic revolution, iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against u
troops and civilians
this history is well known
rather than remain trapped in the past, i've made it clear to iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward
the question now is not what iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build
i recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve
there will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect
but it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point
this is not simply about america's interests
it's about preventing a nuclear arms race in the middle east that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path
i understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not
no single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons
and that's why i strongly reaffirmed america's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons
and any nation   including iran   should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
that commitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it
and i am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal
the fourth issue that i will address is democracy
i know   i know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in iraq
so let me be clear
no system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other
that does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people
each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people
america does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election
but i do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things
the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed
confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice
government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people
the freedom to live as you choose
these are not just american ideas
they are human rights
and that is why we will support them everywhere
now, there is no straight line to realize this promise
but this much is clear
governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure
suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away
america   america respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them
and we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments   provided they govern with respect for all their people
this last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they're out of power
once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others
so no matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power
you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion
you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise
you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party
without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy
thank you
the fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom
islam has a proud tradition of tolerance
we see it in the history of andalusia and cordoba during the inquisition
i saw it firsthand as a child in indonesia, where devout christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly muslim country
that is the spirit we need today
people in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul
this tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways
among some muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of somebody else's faith
the richness of religious diversity must be upheld   whether it is for maronites in lebanon or the copts in egypt
and if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among muslims, as well, as the divisions between sunni and shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in iraq
freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together
we must always examine the ways in which we protect it
for instance, in the united states, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for muslims to fulfill their religious obligation
that's why i'm committed to working with american muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat
likewise, it is important for western countries to avoid impeding muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit   for instance, by dictating what clothes a muslim woman should wear
we can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism
in fact, faith should bring us together
and that's why we're forging service projects in america to bring together christians, muslims, and jews
that's why we welcome efforts like saudi arabian king abdullah's interfaith dialogue and turkey's leadership in the alliance of civilizations
around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to action   whether it is combating malaria in africa, or providing relief after a natural disaster
the sixth issue   the sixth issue that i want to address is women's rights
i know  i know   and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue
i reject the view of some in the west that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but i do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality
and it is no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to be prosperous
now, let me be clear
issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for islam
in turkey, pakistan, bangladesh, indonesia, we've seen muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead
meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues in many aspects of american life, and in countries around the world
i am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons
our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity   men and women   to reach their full potential
i do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and i respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles
but it should be their choice
and that is why the united states will partner with any muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursue employment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams
finally, i want to discuss economic development and opportunity
i know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory
the internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home
trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and change in communities
in all nations   including america   this change can bring fear
fear that because of modernity we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our identities   those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions, and our faith
but i also know that human progress cannot be denied
there need not be contradictions between development and tradition
countries like japan and south korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures
the same is true for the astonishing progress within muslim-majority countries from kuala lumpur to dubai
in ancient times and in our times, muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education
and this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work
many gulf states have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development
but all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century   and in too   and in too many muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas
i'm emphasizing such investment within my own country
and while america in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement
on education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one that brought my father to america
at the same time, we will encourage more americans to study in muslim communities
and we will match promising muslim students with internships in america, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create a new online network, so a young person in kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in cairo
on economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in muslim-majority countries
and i will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and social entrepreneurs in the united states and muslim communities around the world
on science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in muslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to   to the marketplace so they can create more jobs
we'll open centers of scientific excellence in africa, the middle east and southeast asia, and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops
today i'm announcing a new global effort with the organization of the islamic conference to eradicate polio
and we will also expand partnerships with muslim communities to promote child and maternal health
all these things must be done in partnership
americans are ready to join with citizens and governments
community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life
now the issues that i have described will not be easy to address
but we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek   a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and american troops have come home
a world where israelis and palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes
a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all god's children are respected
those are mutual interests
that is the world we seek
but we can only achieve it together
i know there are many, muslim and non-muslim, who question whether we can forge this new beginning
some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way of progress
some suggest that it isn't worth the effort   that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash
many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur
there's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years
but if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward
and i want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country
you, more than anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world
all of us share this world for but a brief moment in time
the question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort   a sustained effort   to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings
it's easier to start wars than to end them
it's easier to blame others than to look inward
it's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share
but we should choose the right path, not just the easy path
there's one rule that lies at the heart of every religion   that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us
this truth transcends nations and peoples   a belief that isn't new
that isn't black or white or brown
that isn't christian or muslim or jew
it's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world
it's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today
we have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written
the holy qur'an tells us
o mankind
we have created you male and a female
and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another
the talmud tells us
the whole of the torah is for the purpose of promoting peace
the holy bible tells us
blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of god
the people of the world can live together in peace
we know that is god's vision
now that must be our work here on earth
thank you
and may god's peace be upon you
thank you very much
thank you
we meet today at a transformational moment   a moment in history when our interconnected world presents us, at once, with great promise but also great peril
now, over the past four months my administration has taken decisive steps to seize the promise and confront these perils
we're working to recover from a global recession while laying a new foundation for lasting prosperity
we're strengthening our armed forces as they fight two wars, at the same time we're renewing american leadership to confront unconventional challenges, from nuclear proliferation to terrorism, from climate change to pandemic disease
and we're bringing to government   and to this white house   unprecedented transparency and accountability and new ways for americans to participate in their democracy
but none of this progress would be possible, and none of these 21st century challenges can be fully met, without america's digital infrastructure   the backbone that underpins a prosperous economy and a strong military and an open and efficient government
without that foundation we can't get the job done
it's long been said that the revolutions in communications and information technology have given birth to a virtual world
but make no mistake
this world   cyberspace   is a world that we depend on every single day
it's our hardware and our software, our desktops and laptops and cell phones and blackberries that have become woven into every aspect of our lives
it's the broadband networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local networks in our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the massive grids that power our nation
it's the classified military and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the world wide web that has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history
so cyberspace is real
and so are the risks that come with it
it's the great irony of our information age   the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy
and this paradox   seen and unseen   is something that we experience every day
it's about the privacy and the economic security of american families
we rely on the internet to pay our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes
but we've had to learn a whole new vocabulary just to stay ahead of the cyber criminals who would do us harm
spyware and malware and spoofing and phishing and botnets
millions of americans have been victimized, their privacy violated, their identities stolen, their lives upended, and their wallets emptied
according to one survey, in the past two years alone cyber crime has cost americans more than 8 billion dollars
i know how it feels to have privacy violated because it has happened to me and the people around me
it's no secret that my presidential campaign harnessed the internet and technology to transform our politics
what isn't widely known is that during the general election hackers managed to penetrate our computer systems
to all of you who donated to our campaign, i want you to all rest assured, our fundraising website was untouched
so your confidential personal and financial information was protected
but between august and october, hackers gained access to emails and a range of campaign files, from policy position papers to travel plans
and we worked closely with the cia, with the fbi and the secret service, and hired security consultants to restore the security of our systems
it was a powerful reminder
in this information age, one of your greatest strengths   in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the internet   could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities
this is a matter, as well, of america's economic competitiveness
the small businesswoman in st
louis, the bond trader in the new york stock exchange, the workers at a global shipping company in memphis, the young entrepreneur in silicon valley   they all need the networks to make the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery, the next great breakthrough
e-commerce alone last year accounted for some 132 billion dollars in retail sales
but every day we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information   the disgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles away, organized crime, the industrial spy and, increasingly, foreign intelligence services
in one brazen act last year, thieves used stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 atm machines in 49 cities around the world   and they did it in just 30 minutes
a single employee of an american company was convicted of stealing intellectual property reportedly worth 400 million dollars
it's been estimated that last year alone cyber criminals stole intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to 1 trillion dollars
in short, america's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity
and this is also a matter of public safety and national security
we count on computer networks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water
we rely on them for public transportation and air traffic control
yet we know that cyber intruders have probed our electrical grid and that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities into darkness
our technological advantage is a key to america's military dominance
but our defense and military networks are under constant attack
al qaeda and other terrorist groups have spoken of their desire to unleash a cyber attack on our country   attacks that are harder to detect and harder to defend against
indeed, in today's world, acts of terror could come not only from a few extremists in suicide vests but from a few key strokes on the computer   a weapon of mass disruption
in one of the most serious cyber incidents to date against our military networks, several thousand computers were infected last year by malicious software   malware
and while no sensitive information was compromised, our troops and defense personnel had to give up those external memory devices   thumb drives   changing the way they used their computers every day
and last year we had a glimpse of the future face of war
as russian tanks rolled into georgia, cyber attacks crippled georgian government websites
the terrorists that sowed so much death and destruction in mumbai relied not only on guns and grenades but also on gps and phones using voice-over-the-internet
for all these reasons, it's now clear this cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation
it's also clear that we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or as a country
in recent years, some progress has been made at the federal level
but just as we failed in the past to invest in our physical infrastructure   our roads, our bridges and rails   we've failed to invest in the security of our digital infrastructure
no single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no single agency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of the challenge
indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have overlapping missions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should   with each other or with the private sector
we saw this in the disorganized response to conficker, the internet worm that in recent months has infected millions of computers around the world
this status quo is no longer acceptable   not when there's so much at stake
we can and we must do better
and that's why shortly after taking office i directed my national security council and homeland security council to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the federal government's efforts to defend our information and communications infrastructure and to recommend the best way to ensure that these networks are able to secure our networks as well as our prosperity
our review was open and transparent
i want to acknowledge, melissa hathaway   who is here   who is the acting senior director for cyberspace on our national security council, who led the review team, as well as the center for strategic and international studies bipartisan commission on cybersecurity, and all who were part of our 60-day review team
they listened to a wide variety of groups, many of which are represented here today and i want to thank for their input
industry and academia, civil liberties and private   privacy advocates
we listened to every level and branch of government   from local to state to federal, civilian, military, homeland as well as intelligence, congress and international partners, as well
i consulted with my national security teams, my homeland security teams, and my economic advisors
today i'm releasing a report on our review, and can announce that my administration will pursue a new comprehensive approach to securing america's digital infrastructure
this new approach starts at the top, with this commitment from me
from now on, our digital infrastructure   the networks and computers we depend on every day   will be treated as they should be
as a strategic national asset
protecting this infrastructure will be a national security priority
we will ensure that these networks are secure, trustworthy and resilient
we will deter, prevent, detect, and defend against attacks and recover quickly from any disruptions or damage
to give these efforts the high-level focus and attention they deserve   and as part of the new, single national security staff announced this week   i'm creating a new office here at the white house that will be led by the cybersecurity coordinator
because of the critical importance of this work, i will personally select this official
i'll depend on this official in all matters relating to cybersecurity, and this official will have my full support and regular access to me as we confront these challenges
today, i want to focus on the important responsibilities this office will fulfill
orchestrating and integrating all cybersecurity policies for the government
working closely with the office of management and budget to ensure agency budgets reflect those priorities
and, in the event of major cyber incident or attack, coordinating our response
to ensure that federal cyber policies enhance our security and our prosperity, my cybersecurity coordinator will be a member of the national security staff as well as the staff of my national economic council
to ensure that policies keep faith with our fundamental values, this office will also include an official with a portfolio specifically dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of the american people
there's much work to be done, and the report we're releasing today outlines a range of actions that we will pursue in five key areas
first, working in partnership with the communities represented here today, we will develop a new comprehensive strategy to secure america's information and communications networks
to ensure a coordinated approach across government, my cybersecurity coordinator will work closely with my chief technology officer, aneesh chopra, and my chief information officer, vivek kundra
to ensure accountability in federal agencies, cybersecurity will be designated as one of my key management priorities
clear milestones and performances metrics will measure progress
and as we develop our strategy, we will be open and transparent, which is why you'll find today's report and a wealth of related information on our web site, www
whitehouse
gov
second, we will work with all the key players   including state and local governments and the private sector   to ensure an organized and unified response to future cyber incidents
given the enormous damage that can be caused by even a single cyber attack, ad hoc responses will not do
nor is it sufficient to simply strengthen our defenses after incidents or attacks occur
just as we do for natural disasters, we have to have plans and resources in place beforehand   sharing information, issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response
third, we will strengthen the public/private partnerships that are critical to this endeavor
the vast majority of our critical information infrastructure in the united states is owned and operated by the private sector
so let me be very clear
my administration will not dictate security standards for private companies
on the contrary, we will collaborate with industry to find technology solutions that ensure our security and promote prosperity
fourth, we will continue to invest in the cutting-edge research and development necessary for the innovation and discovery we need to meet the digital challenges of our time
and that's why my administration is making major investments in our information infrastructure
laying broadband lines to every corner of america
building a smart electric grid to deliver energy more efficiently
pursuing a next generation of air traffic control systems
and moving to electronic health records, with privacy protections, to reduce costs and save lives
and finally, we will begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and digital literacy from our boardrooms to our classrooms, and to build a digital workforce for the 21st century
and that's why we're making a new commitment to education in math and science, and historic investments in science and research and development
because it's not enough for our children and students to master today's technologies   social networking and e-mailing and texting and blogging   we need them to pioneer the technologies that will allow us to work effectively through these new media and allow us to prosper in the future
so these are the things we will do
let me also be clear about what we will not do
our pursuit of cybersecurity will not   i repeat, will not include   monitoring private sector networks or internet traffic
we will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish as americans
indeed, i remain firmly committed to net neutrality so we can keep the internet as it should be   open and free
the task i have described will not be easy
some 1
5 billion people around the world are already online, and more are logging on every day
groups and governments are sharpening their cyber capabilities
protecting our prosperity and security in this globalized world is going to be a long, difficult struggle demanding patience and persistence over many years
but we need to remember
we're only at the beginning
the epochs of history are long   the agricultural revolution
the industrial revolution
by comparison, our information age is still in its infancy
we're only at web 2
now our virtual world is going viral
and we've only just begun to explore the next generation of technologies that will transform our lives in ways we can't even begin to imagine
so a new world awaits   a world of greater security and greater potential prosperity   if we reach for it, if we lead
so long as i'm president of the united states, we will do just that
and the united states   the nation that invented the internet, that launched an information revolution, that transformed the world   will do what we did in the 20th century and lead once more in the 21st
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
good morning, everybody
please be seated
thank you all for being here
let me just acknowledge the presence of some of my outstanding cabinet members and advisors
we've got our secretary of state, hillary clinton
we have our cia director leon panetta
we have our secretary of defense william gates
secretary napolitano of department of homeland security
attorney general eric holder
my national security advisor jim jones
and i want to especially thank our acting archivist of the united states, adrienne thomas
i also want to acknowledge several members of the house who have great interest in intelligence matters
i want to thank congressman reyes, congressman hoekstra, congressman king, as well as congressman thompson, for being here today
thank you so much
these are extraordinary times for our country
we're confronting a historic economic crisis
we're fighting two wars
we face a range of challenges that will define the way that americans will live in the 21st century
so there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear
and we've begun to make progress
just this week, we've taken steps to protect american consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely
the   it's a good bill
the engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy
i want to say to the members of congress, i welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four months on these and other issues
in the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as president is to keep the american people safe
it's the first thing that i think about when i wake up in the morning
it's the last thing that i think about when i go to sleep at night
and this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm
we are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on american soil in our history
we know that al qaeda is actively planning to attack us again
we know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it
already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal
for the first time since 2002, we're providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in afghanistan and pakistan
we're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy
we have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons
and we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years
we're better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster
we're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda and its affiliates
and we have renewed american diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world
these steps are all critical to keeping america secure
but i believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values
the documents that we hold in this very hall   the declaration of independence, the constitution, the bill of rights   these are not simply words written into aging parchment
they are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world
i stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents
my father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered
my mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when i lived as a child in a foreign land
my own american journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words   to form a more perfect union
i've studied the constitution as a student, i've taught it as a teacher, i've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator
i took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution as commander-in-chief, and as a citizen, i know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake
i make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism
we uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe
time and again, our values have been our best national security asset   in war and peace
in times of ease and in eras of upheaval
fidelity to our values is the reason why the united states of america grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world
it's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from america's armed forces than from their own government
it's the reason why america has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries
it's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty
from europe to the pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law
that is who we are
and where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, america must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology
after 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era   that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law
that our government would need new tools to protect the american people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out
unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions
i believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the american people
but i also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight
that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions
instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford
and during this season of fear, too many of us   democrats and republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens   fell silent
in other words, we went off course
and this is not my assessment alone
it was an assessment that was shared by the american people who nominated candidates for president from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach   one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at guantanamo bay
now let me be clear
we are indeed at war with al qaeda and its affiliates
we do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat
but we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process
in checks and balances and accountability
for reasons that i will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable   a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass
and that's why i took several steps upon taking office to better protect the american people
first, i banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the united states of america
i know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe
i could not disagree more
as commander-in-chief, i see the intelligence
i bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe
and i categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation
what's more, they undermine the rule of law
they alienate us in the world
they serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with america
they risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that americans will be mistreated if they are captured
in short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts   they undermined them, and that is why i ended them once and for all
now, i should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration
as senator mccain once said, torture serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us
and even under president bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration   including a secretary of state, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community   that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history
that's why we must leave these methods where they belong   in the past
they are not who we are, and they are not america
the second decision that i made was to order the closing of the prison camp at guantanamo bay
for over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at guantanamo
during that time, the system of military commissions that were in place at guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists
let me repeat that
three convictions in over seven years
instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the supreme court invalidated the entire system
meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration
let me repeat that
two-thirds of the detainees were released before i took office and ordered the closure of guantanamo
there is also no question that guantanamo set back the moral authority that is america's strongest currency in the world
instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law
in fact, part of the rationale for establishing guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law   a proposition that the supreme court soundly rejected
meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, guantanamo became a symbol that helped al qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause
indeed, the existence of guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained
so the record is clear
rather than keeping us safer, the prison at guantanamo has weakened american national security
it is a rallying cry for our enemies
it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries
by any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it
that's why i argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and that is why i ordered it closed within one year
the third decision that i made was to order a review of all pending cases at guantanamo
i knew when i ordered guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex
there are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo
in dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting from scratch
we're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess   a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country
indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in washington would be taking place whether or not i decided to close guantanamo
for example, the court order to release 17 uighurs   17 uighur detainees took place last fall, when george bush was president
the supreme court that invalidated the system of prosecution at guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by republican presidents   not wild-eyed liberals
in other words, the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility
the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place
now let me be blunt
there are no neat or easy answers here
i wish there were
but i can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo
as president, i refuse to allow this problem to fester
i refuse to pass it on to somebody else
it is my responsibility to solve the problem
our security interests will not permit us to delay
our courts won't allow it
and neither should our conscience
now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that have characterized the last several years
i'm an elected official
i understand these problems arouse passions and concerns
they should
we're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face
but i have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years
i'll leave that to others
i want to solve these problems, and i want to solve them together as americans
and we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue
listening to the recent debate, i've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather than educate them
words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country
so i want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues
i will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the american people and the values that we hold most dear
and i'll focus on two broad areas
first, issues relating to guantanamo and our detention policy
but, second, i also want to discuss issues relating to security and transparency
now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as i can
we are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the united states who endanger the american people
where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders   namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety
as we make these decisions, bear in mind the following face
nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists
as republican lindsey graham said, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the united states is not rational
we are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at guantanamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them
and as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield
that's why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past
instead we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands
now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories
first, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated american criminal laws in federal courts   courts provided for by the united states constitution
some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists
they are wrong
our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists
the record makes that clear
ramzi yousef tried to blow up the world trade center
he was convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in u
prisons
zacarias moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker
he was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison
if we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo
recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-marri, in federal court after years of legal confusion
we're preparing to transfer another detainee to the southern district court of new york, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in kenya and tanzania   bombings that killed over 200 people
preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction
and after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do
the second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best tried through military commissions
military commissions have a history in the united states dating back to george washington and the revolutionary war
they are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war
they allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering
they allow for the safety and security of participants
and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts
now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part
they should look at the record
in 2006, i did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the bush administration and passed by the congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal
i said at that time, however, that i supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms
those are the reforms that we are now making
instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law
we will no longer permit the use of evidence   as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods
we will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay
and we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify
these reforms, among others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and i will work with congress and members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective
the third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts
now, let me repeat what i said earlier
this has nothing to do with my decision to close guantanamo
it has to do with the rule of law
the courts have spoken
they have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the people currently held at guantanamo
nineteen of these findings took place before i was sworn into office
i cannot ignore these rulings because as president, i too am bound by the law
the united states is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these rulings
the fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country
so far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer
and my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation
now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the american people
and i have to be honest here   this is the toughest single issue that we will face
we're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at guantanamo who pose a danger to our country
but even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the united states
examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al qaeda training camps, or commanded taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to osama bin laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill americans
these are people who, in effect, remain at war with the united states
let me repeat
i am not going to release individuals who endanger the american people
al qaeda terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the united states, and those that we capture   like other prisoners of war   must be prevented from attacking us again
having said that, we must recognize that these detention policies cannot be unbounded
they can't be based simply on what i or the executive branch decide alone
that's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure that they are in line with the rule of law
we must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category
we must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes
we must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified
i know that creating such a system poses unique challenges
and other countries have grappled with this question
now, so must we
but i want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred
our goal is not to avoid a legitimate legal framework
in our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man
if and when we determine that the united states must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight
and so, going forward, my administration will work with congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our constitution
now, as our efforts to close guantanamo move forward, i know that the politics in congress will be difficult
these are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials
you can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue   designed to frighten the population
i get it
but if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes
and if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then i guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future
i have confidence that the american people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing
i am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the constitution   so did each and every member of congress
and together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future presidents to keep this country safe
now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency
national security requires a delicate balance
one the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency
on the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security   for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates
in these and other cases, lives are at stake
now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, i released memos issued by the previous administration's office of legal counsel
i did not do this because i disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and i didn't release the documents because i rejected their legal rationales   although i do on both counts
i released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and i had already banned those methods
the argument that somehow by releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense
we will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach
that approach is now prohibited
in short, i released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them
and the ensuing debate has helped the american people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used
on the other hand, i recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by u
personnel between 2002 and 2004
individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated and they have been held accountable
there was and is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong
nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes
however, it was my judgment   informed by my national security team   that releasing these photos would inflame anti-american opinion and allow our enemies to paint u
troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war
in short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos
there are nearly 200,000 americans who are serving in harm's way, and i have a solemn responsibility for their safety as commander-in-chief
nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way
now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory
they are not to me
in each of these cases, i had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security
and this balance brings with it a precious responsibility
there's no doubt that the american people have seen this balance tested over the last several years
in the images from abu ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before i was president, the american people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of americans have fought for
and whether it was the run-up to the iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them
and that caused suspicion to build up
and that leads to a thirst for accountability
i understand that
i ran for president promising transparency, and i meant what i said
and that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the american people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable
but i have never argued   and i never will   that our most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book
i will never abandon   and will vigorously defend   the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the american people safe
here's the difference though
whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, i will insist that there is oversight of my actions   by congress or by the courts
we're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters
because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers   especially when it comes to sensitive administration   information
now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the state secrets privilege
this is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs
it's been used by many past presidents   republican and democrat   for many decades
and while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect national security, i am concerned that it has been over-used
it is also currently the subject of a wide range of lawsuits
so let me lay out some principles here
we must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government
and that's why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice
and we plan to embrace several principles for reform
we will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege
we will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own formal process, including review by a justice department committee and the personal approval of the attorney general
and each year we will voluntarily report to congress when we have invoked the privilege and why because, as i said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions
on all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, i wish i could say that there was some simple formula out there to be had
there is not
these often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach
but the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple
we will safeguard what we must to protect the american people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system
i will never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable
i will deal with congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government
i will tell the american people what i know and don't know, and when i release something publicly or keep something secret, i will tell you why
now, in all the areas that i've discussed today, the policies that i've proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years
to protect the american people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques
we are closing the prison at guantanamo
we are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists
we are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege
these are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing
their implementation will take time, but they will get done
there's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions
even as we clean up the mess at guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the public
we seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long term   not to serve immediate politics, but to do what's right over the long term
by doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next president and the president after that   a legacy that protects the american people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad
now, this is what i mean when i say that we need to focus on the future
i recognize that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past
when it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high
some americans are angry
others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debates that they have lost
i know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission
i've opposed the creation of such a commission because i believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability
the congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques
the department of justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice
it's no secret there is a tendency in washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another
and it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy
but nothing will contribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years
already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in washington to different sides to laying blame
it can distract us from focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future
we see that, above all, in the recent debate   how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends
on the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security over transparency
and on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words
anything goes
their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the president should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants   provided it is a president with whom they agree
both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right
the american people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems
they know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense
that, after all, is the unique genius of america
that's the challenge laid down by our constitution
that has been the source of our strength through the ages
that's what makes the united states of america different as a nation
i can stand here today, as president of the united states, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law
make no mistake
if we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then i will not be able to say that as president
and if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall
the framers who drafted the constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years
but our constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through world war and cold war, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically
it provides a compass that can help us find our way
it hasn't always been easy
we are an imperfect people
every now and then, there are those who think that america's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building
and we hear such voices today
but over the long haul the american people have resisted that temptation
and though we've made our share of mistakes, required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world
now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism
and unlike the civil war or world war ii, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end
right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take american lives
that will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and   in all probability   10 years from now
neither i nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes american lives
but i can say with certainty that my administration   along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security   will do everything in our power to keep the american people safe
and i do know with certainty that we can defeat al qaeda
because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate america from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals
this must be our common purpose
i ran for president because i believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together
we will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides america   it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation
we've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours
we will do so once again
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america
president obama
thank you very much
thank you, notre dame
thank you
thank you
please, have a seat
thank you
well first of all, congratulations, class of 2009
congratulations to all the parents, the cousins, the aunts, the uncles   the   all the people who helped to bring you to the point that you are here today
thank you so much to father jenkins for that extraordinary introduction, even though you said what i want to say much more elegantly
you are doing an extraordinary job as president of this extraordinary institution, and your continued and courageous and contagious commitment to honest, thoughtful dialogue is an inspiration to us all
so, good afternoon, to father hesburgh, to notre dame trustees, to faculty, to family
i am honored to be here today
and
i am grateful to all of you for allowing me to be a part of your graduation
and i also want to thank you for the honorary degree that i received
i know it has not been without controversy
i don't know if you're aware of this, but these honorary degrees are apparently pretty hard to come by
so far i'm only 1 for 2 as president
father
hesburgh is 150 for 150
i guess that's better
so, father ted after the ceremony maybe you can give me some pointers to boost my average
i also want to congratulate the class of 2009 for all your accomplishments
and since
president obama
and since   this is notre dame, i mean   that's
all right
and since
president obama
we're fine, everybody
we're   we're following brennan's adage that we don't do things easily
we want to   we're   we're not going to shy away from things that are uncomfortable sometimes
now, since   since this is notre dame i think we should talk not only about your accomplishments in the classroom, but also in the competitive arena
no, don't worry, i'm not going to talk about that
we all know about this university's proud and storied football team, but i also hear that notre dame holds the largest outdoor 5-on-5 basketball tournament in the world   bookstore basketball
now this excites me
i want to congratulate the winners of this year's tournament, a team by the name of hallelujah holla back
congratulations
well done
though i have to say, i'm personally disappointed that the barack o'ballers did not pull it out this year
so next year, if you need a 6'2 forward with a decent jumper, you know where i live
now, every one of you should be proud of what you've achieved at this institution
one hundred and sixty-three classes of notre dame graduates have sat where you sit today
some were here during years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare   periods of relative peace and prosperity that required little by way of sacrifice or struggle
you, however, are not getting off that easy
you have a different deal
your class has come of age at a moment of great consequence for our nation and for the world   a rare inflection point in history where the size and scope of the challenges before us require that we remake our world to renew its promise, that we align our deepest values and commitments to the demands of a new age
it's a privilege and a responsibility afforded to few generations   and a task that you're now called to fulfill
this generation, your generation is the one that must find a path back to prosperity and decide how we respond to a global economy that left millions behind even before the most recent crisis hit   an economy where greed and short-term thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness, and diligence, and an honest day's work
your generation   your generation must decide how to save god's creation from a changing climate that threatens to destroy it
your generation must seek peace at a time when there are those who will stop at nothing to do us harm, and when weapons in the hands of a few can destroy the many
and we must find a way to reconcile our ever-shrinking world with its ever-growing diversity   diversity of thought, diversity of culture, and diversity of belief
in short, we must find a way to live together as one human family
and   and it's this last challenge that i'd like to talk about today, despite the fact that father john stole all my best lines
for the major threats we face in the 21st century   whether it's global recession or violent extremism, the spread of nuclear weapons or pandemic disease   these things do not discriminate
they do not recognize borders
they do not see color
they do not target specific ethnic groups
moreover, no one person, or religion, or nation can meet these challenges alone
our very survival has never required greater cooperation and greater understanding among all people from all places than at this moment in history
unfortunately, finding that common ground   recognizing that our fates are tied up, as dr
king said, in a single garment of destiny   is not easy
and part of the problem, of course, lies in the imperfections of man   our selfishness, our pride, our stubbornness, our acquisitiveness, our insecurities, our egos   all the cruelties large and small that those of us in the christian tradition understand to be rooted in original sin
we too often seek advantage over others
we cling to outworn prejudice and fear those who are unfamiliar
too many of us view life only through the lens of immediate self-interest and crass materialism   in which the world is necessarily a zero-sum game
the strong too often dominate the weak, and too many of those with wealth and with power find all manner of justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty and injustice
and so for all our technology and scientific advances, we see here in this country and around the globe violence and want and strife that would seem sadly familiar to those in ancient times
we know these things
and hopefully one of the benefits of the wonderful education that you have received here at notre dame is that you've had time to consider these wrongs in the world, perhaps recognized impulses in yourself that you want to leave behind
you've grown determined   each in your own way   to right them
and yet one of the vexing things for those of us interested in promoting greater understanding and cooperation among people is the discovery that even bringing together persons of good will, bringing together men and women of principle and purpose   even accomplishing that can be difficult
the soldier and the lawyer may both love this country with equal passion, and yet reach very different conclusions on the specific steps needed to protect us from harm
the gay activist and the evangelical pastor may both deplore the ravages of hiv/aids, but find themselves unable to bridge the cultural divide that might unite their efforts
those who speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in an admirable conviction about the sacredness of life, but so are the parents of a child with juvenile diabetes who are convinced that their son's or daughter's hardships might be relieved
the   the question, then   the question, then, is how do we work through these conflicts
is it possible for us to join hands in common effort
as citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy, how do we engage in vigorous debate
how does each of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we consider right, without, as father john said, demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side
and of course, nowhere do these questions come up more powerfully than on the issue of abortion
as i considered the controversy surrounding my visit here, i was reminded of an encounter i had during my senate campaign, one that i describe in a book i wrote called the audacity of hope
in a few days after i won the democratic nomination, i received an e-mail from a doctor who told me that while he voted for me in the illinois primary, he had a serious concern that might prevent him from voting for me in the general election
he described himself as a christian who was strongly pro-life   but that was not what was preventing him potentially from voting for me
what bothered the doctor was an entry that my campaign staff had posted on my website   an entry that said i would fight, quote, right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose, unquote
the doctor said he had assumed i was a reasonable person
he supported my policy initiatives to help the poor and to lift up our educational system, but that if i truly believed that every pro-life individual was simply an ideologue who wanted to inflict suffering on women, then i was not very reasonable
he wrote, i do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words
fair-minded words
after i read the doctor's letter, i wrote back to him and i thanked him
and i didn't change my underlying position, but i did tell my staff to change the words on my website
and i said a prayer that night that i might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me
because when we do that   when we open up our hearts and our minds to those who may not think precisely like we do or believe precisely what we believe   that's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground
that's when we begin to say, maybe we won't agree on abortion, but we can still agree that this heart-wrenching decision for any woman is not made casually, and it has both moral and spiritual dimensions
so let us work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions
let's reduce unintended pregnancies
let's make adoption more available
let's   let's provide care and support for women who do carry their children to term
let's honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion, and draft a sensible conscience clause, and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded not only in sound science, but also in clear ethics, as well as respect for the equality of women
those are things we can do
now, understand   understand, class of 2009, i do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away, because no matter how much we may want to fudge it   indeed, while we know that the views of most americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory   the fact is that at some level, the views of the two camps are irreconcilable
each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction
but surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature
open hearts
open minds
fair-minded words
it's a way of life that has always been the notre dame tradition
you know, father   father hesburgh has long spoken of this institution as both a   a lighthouse and a crossroads, a lighthouse that stands apart, shining with the wisdom of the catholic tradition, while the crossroads is where differences of culture and religion and conviction can co-exist with friendship, civility, hospitality, and especially love
and i want to join him and father john in saying how inspired i am by the maturity and responsibility with which this class has approached the debate surrounding today's ceremony
you are an example of what notre dame is about
now, this tradition of cooperation and understanding is one that i learned in my own life many years ago   also with the help of the catholic church
you see, i was not raised in a particularly religious household, but my mother instilled in me a sense of service and empathy that eventually led me to become a community organizer after i graduated college
and a group of catholic churches in chicago helped fund an organization known as the developing communities project, and we worked to lift up south side neighborhoods that had been devastated when the local steel plant closed
and it was quite an eclectic crew   catholic and protestant churches, jewish and african american organizers, working-class black, white, and hispanic residents   all of us with different experiences, all of us with different beliefs
but all of us learned to work side by side because all of us saw in these neighborhoods other human beings who needed our help to find jobs and improve schools
we were bound together in the service of others
and something else happened during the time i spent in these neighborhoods, perhaps because the church folks i worked with were so welcoming and understanding
perhaps because they invited me to their services and sang with me from their hymnals
perhaps because i was really broke and they fed me
perhaps because i witnessed all of the good works their faith inspired them to perform, i found myself drawn not just to the work with the church
i was drawn to be in the church
it was through this service that i was brought to christ
and at the time, cardinal joseph bernardin was the archbishop of chicago
and for those of you   for those of you too young to have known him or known of him, he was a kind and good and wise man
a saintly man
i can still remember him speaking at one of the first organizing meetings i attended on the south side
he stood as both a lighthouse and a crossroads   unafraid to speak his mind on moral issues ranging from poverty and aids and abortion to the death penalty and nuclear war
and yet, he was congenial and gentle in his persuasion, always trying to bring people together, always trying to find common ground
and just before he died, a reporter asked cardinal bernardin about this approach to his ministry
and he said, you can't really get on with preaching the gospel until you've touched hearts and minds
my heart and mind were touched by him
they were touched by the words and deeds of the men and women i worked alongside in parishes across chicago
and i'd like to think that we touched the hearts and minds of the neighborhood families whose lives we helped change
for this, i believe, is our highest calling
now, you, class of 2009, are about to enter the next phase of your life at a time of great uncertainty
you'll be called to help restore a free market that's also fair to all who are willing to work
you'll be called to seek new sources of energy that can save our planet
to give future generations the same chance that you had to receive an extraordinary education
and whether as a person drawn to public service, or simply someone who insists on being an active citizen, you will be exposed to more opinions and ideas broadcast through more means of communication than ever existed before
you'll hear talking heads scream on cable
and you'll read blogs that claim definitive knowledge
and you will watch politicians pretend they know what they're talking about
occasionally, you may have the great fortune of actually seeing important issues debated by people who do know what they're talking about   by well-intentioned people with brilliant minds and mastery of the facts
in fact, i suspect that some of you will be among those brightest stars
and in this world of competing claims about what is right and what is true, have confidence in the values with which you've been raised and educated
be unafraid to speak your mind when those values are at stake
hold firm to your faith and allow it to guide you on your journey
in other words, stand as a lighthouse
but remember, too, that you can be a crossroads
remember, too, that the ultimate irony of faith is that it necessarily admits doubt
it's the belief in things not seen
it's beyond our capacity as human beings to know with certainty what god has planned for us or what he asks of us
and those of us who believe must trust that his wisdom is greater than our own
and this doubt should not push us away our faith
but it should humble us
it should temper our passions, cause us to be wary of too much self-righteousness
it should compel us to remain open and curious and eager to continue the spiritual and moral debate that began for so many of you within the walls of notre dame
and within our vast democracy, this doubt should remind us even as we cling to our faith to persuade through reason, through an appeal, whenever we can, to universal rather than parochial principles, and most of all through an abiding example of good works and charity and kindness and service that moves hearts and minds
for if there is one law that we can be most certain of, it is the law that binds people of all faiths and no faith together
it's no coincidence that it exists in christianity and judaism, in islam and hinduism, in buddhism and humanism
it is, of course, the golden rule   the call to treat one another as we wish to be treated
the call to love
the call to serve
to do what we can to make a difference in the lives of those with whom we share the same brief moment on this earth
so many of you at notre dame   by the last count, upwards of 80 percent   have lived this law of love through the service you've performed at schools and hospitals, international relief agencies and local charities
brennan is just one example of what your class has accomplished
that's incredibly impressive, a powerful testament to this institution
and now   now you must carry the tradition forward
make it a way of life
because when you serve, it doesn't just improve your community, it makes you a part of your community
it breaks down walls
it fosters cooperation
and when that happens   when   when people set aside their differences, even for a moment, to work in common effort toward a common goal
when they struggle together, and sacrifice together, and learn from one another   then all things are possible
after all, i stand here today, as president and as an african american, on the 55th anniversary of the day that the supreme court handed down the decision in brown versus board of education
now, brown was of course the first major step in dismantling the separate but equal doctrine
but it would take a number of years and a nationwide movement to fully realize the dream of civil rights for all of god's children
there were freedom rides and lunch counters and billy clubs, and there was also a civil rights commission appointed by president eisenhower
it was the 12 resolutions recommended by this commission that would ultimately become law in the civil rights act of 1964
there were six members of this commission
it included five whites and one african american, democrats and republicans, two southern governors, the dean of a southern law school, a midwestern university president, and your own father ted hesburgh, president of notre dame
so they worked for two years, and at times president eisenhower had to intervene personally since no hotel or restaurant in the south would serve the black and white members of the commission together
and finally when they reached an impasse in louisiana, father ted flew them all to notre dame's retreat in land o'lakes, wisconsin   where they eventually   where they eventually overcame their differences and hammered out a final deal
and years later, president eisenhower asked father ted how on earth he was able to broker an agreement between men of such different backgrounds and beliefs
and father ted simply said that during their first dinner in wisconsin they discovered they were all fishermen
and so he quickly readied a boat for a twilight trip out on the lake
they fished, and they talked, and they changed the course of history
i will not pretend that the challenges we face will be easy, or that the answers will come quickly, or that all our differences and divisions will fade happily away   because life is not that simple
it never has been
but as you leave here today, remember the lessons of cardinal bernardin, of father hesburgh, of movements for change both large and small
remember that each of us, endowed with the dignity possessed by all children of god, has the grace to recognize ourselves in one another
to understand that we all seek the same love of family, the same fulfillment of a life well lived
remember that in the end, in some way we are all fishermen
if nothing else, that knowledge should give us faith that through our collective labor, and god's providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other's burdens, america will continue on its precious journey towards that more perfect union
congratulations, class of 2009
may god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america
thank you
thank you, everybody
good evening
you know, i had an entire speech prepared for this wonderful occasion, but now that i'm here i think i'm going to try something a little different
tonight i want to speak from the heart
i'm going to speak off the cuff
good evening
pause for laughter
wait a minute, this may not be working as well as i   let me try that again
good evening, everybody
i would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of my first 100 days
i am barack obama
most of you covered me
all of you voted for me
apologies to the fox table
they're   where are they
i have to confess i really did not want to be here tonight, but i knew i had to come   just one more problem that i've inherited from george w
bush
but now that i'm here, it's great to be here
it's great to see all of you
michelle obama is here, the first lady of the united states
hasn't she been an outstanding first lady
she's even begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, because no matter which party you belong to we can all agree that michelle has the right to bare arms
now sasha and malia aren't here tonight because they're grounded
you can't just take air force one on a joy ride to manhattan
i don't care whose kids you are
we've been setting some ground rules here
they're starting to get a little carried away
now, speaking   when i think about children obviously i think about michelle and it reminds me that tomorrow is mother's day
happy mother's day to all the mothers in the audience
i do have to say, though, that this is a tough holiday for rahm emanuel because he's not used to saying the word day after mother
that's true
david axelrod is here
you know, david and i have been together for a long time
i can still remember   i got to sort of   i tear up a little bit when i think back to that day that i called ax so many years ago and said, you and i can do wonderful things together
and he said to me the same thing that partners all across america are saying to one another right now
let's go to iowa and make it official
michael steele is in the house tonight
or as he would say, in the heezy
what's up
where is michael
michael, for the last time, the republican party does not qualify for a bailout
rush limbaugh does not count as a troubled asset, i'm sorry
dick cheney was supposed to be here but he is very busy working on his memoirs, tentatively titled, how to shoot friends and interrogate people
you know, it's been a whirlwind of activity these first hundred days
we've enacted a major economic recovery package, we passed a budget, we forged a new path in iraq, and no president in history has ever named three commerce secretaries this quickly
which reminds me, if judd gregg is here, your business cards are ready now
on top of that, i've also reversed the ban on stem cell research, signed an expansion   signed an expansion of the children's health insurance
just last week, car and driver named me auto executive of the year
something i'm very proud of
we've also begun to change the culture in washington
we've even made the white house a place where people can learn and can grow
just recently, larry summers asked if he could chair the white house council on women and girls
and i do appreciate that larry is here tonight because it is seven hours past his bedtime
gibbs liked that one
in the last hundred days, we've also grown the democratic party by infusing it with new energy and bringing in fresh, young faces like arlen specter
now, joe biden rightly deserves a lot of credit for convincing arlen to make the switch, but secretary clinton actually had a lot to do with it too
one day she just pulled him aside and she said, arlen, you know what i always say   if you can't beat them, join them
which brings me to another thing that's changed in this new, warmer, fuzzier white house, and that's my relationship with hillary
you know, we had been rivals during the campaign, but these days we could not be closer
in fact, the second she got back from mexico she pulled into a hug and gave me a big kiss
told me i'd better get down there myself
which i really appreciated
i mean, it was   it was nice
and of course we've also begun to change america's image in the world
we talked about this during this campaign and we're starting to execute
we've renewed alliances with important partners and friends
if you look on the screen there, there i am with japanese prime minister taro aso
there i am with gordon brown
but as i said during the campaign, we can't just talk to our friends
as hard as it is, we also have to talk to our enemies, and i've begun to do exactly that
take a look at the monitor there
now, let me be clear, just because he handed me a copy of peter pan does not mean that i'm going to read it   but it's good diplomatic practice to just accept these gifts
all this change hasn't been easy
change never is
so i've cut the tension by bringing a new friend to the white house
he's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic
you just have to keep him on a tight leash
every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into trouble
but enough about joe biden
all in all, we're proud of the change we've brought to washington in these first hundred days but we've got a lot of work left to do, as all of you know
so i'd like to talk a little bit about what my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days
during the second hundred days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my first hundred days
it's going to be big, folks
in the next hundred days, i will learn to go off the prompter and joe biden will learn to stay on the prompter
in the next hundred days, our bipartisan outreach will be so successful that even john boehner will consider becoming a democrat
after all, we have a lot in common
he is a person of color
although not a color that appears in the natural world
what's up, john
in the next hundred days, i will meet with a leader who rules over millions with an iron fist, who owns the airwaves and uses his power to crush all who would challenge his authority at the ballot box
it's good to see you, mayor bloomberg
in the next hundred days, we will housetrain our dog, bo, because the last thing tim geithner needs is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant
in the next hundred days, i will strongly consider losing my cool
finally, i believe that my next hundred days will be so successful i will be able to complete them in 72 days
and on the 73rd day, i will rest
i just   i want to end by saying a few words about the men and women in this room whose job it is to inform the public and pursue the truth
you know, we meet tonight at a moment of extraordinary challenge for this nation and for the world, but it's also a time of real hardship for the field of journalism
and like so many other businesses in this global age, you've seen sweeping changes and technology and communications that lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety about what the future will hold
across the country, there are extraordinary, hardworking journalists who have lost their jobs in recent days, recent weeks, recent months
and i know that each newspaper and media outlet is wrestling with how to respond to these changes, and some are struggling simply to stay open
and it won't be easy
not every ending will be a happy one
but it's also true that your ultimate success as an industry is essential to the success of our democracy
it's what makes this thing work
you know, thomas jefferson once said that if he had the choice between a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, he would not hesitate to choose the latter
clearly, thomas jefferson never had cable news to contend with   but his central point remains
a government without newspapers, a government without a tough and vibrant media of all sorts, is not an option for the united states of america
so i may not   i may not agree with everything you write or report
i may even complain, or more likely gibbs will complain, from time to time about how you do your jobs, but i do so with the knowledge that when you are at your best, then you help me be at my best
you help all of us who serve at the pleasure of the american people do our jobs better by holding us accountable, by demanding honesty, by preventing us from taking shortcuts and falling into easy political games that people are so desperately weary of
and that kind of reporting is worth preserving   not just for your sake, but for the public's
we count on you to help us make sense of a complex world and tell the stories of our lives the way they happen, and we look for you for truth, even if it's always an approximation, even if
this is a season of renewal and reinvention
that is what government must learn to do, that's what businesses must learn to do, and that's what journalism is in the process of doing
and when i look out at this room and think about the dedicated men and women whose questions i've answered over the last few years, i know that for all the challenges this industry faces, it's not short on talent or creativity or passion or commitment
it's not short of young people who are eager to break news or the not-so-young who still manage to ask the tough ones time and time again
these qualities alone will not solve all your problems, but they certainly prove that the problems are worth solving
and that is a good place as any to begin
so i offer you my thanks, i offer you my support, and i look forward to working with you and answering to you and the american people as we seek a more perfect union in the months and years ahead
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
thank you very much
to sara bloomfield, for the wonderful introduction and the outstanding work she's doing
to fred zeidman
joel geiderman
wiesel   thank you for your wisdom and your witness
speaker nancy pelosi
senator dick durbin
members of congress
our good friend the ambassador of israel
members of the united states holocaust memorial council
and most importantly, the survivors and rescuers and their families who are here today
it is a great honor for me to be here, and i'm grateful that i have the opportunity to address you briefly
we gather today to mourn the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them
honor those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living
it is the grimmest of ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in history began in one of the most modernized societies of its time, where so many markers of human progress became tools of human depravity
science that can heal used to kill
education that can enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses
the bureaucracy that sustains modern life used as the machinery of mass death   a ruthless, chillingly efficient system where many were responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their hands
while the uniqueness of the holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, the holocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled atrocities throughout history
the scapegoating that leads to hatred and blinds us to our common humanity
the justifications that replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread
the willingness of those who are neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the assigned role of bystander, believing the lie that good people are ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice
but while we are here today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are also here to pay tribute to the human impulse to save
in the moral accounting of the holocaust, as we reckon with numbers like 6 million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched into arms, we also factor in numbers like these
7,200   the number of danish jews ferried to safety, many of whom later returned home to find the neighbors who rescued them had also faithfully tended their homes and businesses and belongings while they were gone
we remember the number five   the five righteous men and women who join us today from poland
we are awed by your acts of courage and conscience
and your presence today compels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would have done what you did
we can only hope that the answer is yes
we also remember the number 5,000   the number of jews rescued by the villagers of le chambon, france   one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents
not a single jew who came there was turned away, or turned in
but it was not until decades later that the villagers spoke of what they had done   and even then, only reluctantly
the author of a book on the rescue found that those he interviewed were baffled by his interest
how could you call us 'good'
they said
we were doing what had to be done
that is the question of the righteous   those who would do extraordinary good at extraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance their own interests, but because it is what must be done
they remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer   these are choices we each have the power to make
they teach us that no one can make us into bystanders without our consent, and that we are never truly alone   that if we have the courage to heed that still, small voice within us, we can form a minyan for righteousness that can span a village, even a nation
their legacy is our inheritance
and the question is, how do we honor and preserve it
how do we ensure that never again isn't an empty slogan, or merely an aspiration, but also a call to action
i believe we start by doing what we are doing today   by bearing witness, by fighting the silence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator
in the face of horrors that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable
my own great uncle returned from his service in world war ii in a state of shock, saying little, alone with painful memories that would not leave his head
he went up into the attic, according to the stories that i've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months
he was one of the liberators   someone who at a very tender age had seen the unimaginable
and so some of the liberators who are here today honor us with their presence   all of whom we honor for their extraordinary service
my great uncle was part of the 89th infantry division   the first americans to reach a nazi concentration camp
and they liberated ohrdruf, part of buchenwald, where tens of thousands had perished
the story goes that when the americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivors and the piles of dead bodies
and general eisenhower made a decision
he ordered germans from the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could see what had been done in their name
and he ordered american troops to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they were fighting against
then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness
and he ordered that photographs and films be made
some of us have seen those same images, whether in the holocaust museum or when i visited yad vashem, and they never leave you
eisenhower said that he wanted to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda
eisenhower understood the danger of silence
he understood that if no one knew what had happened, that would be yet another atrocity   and it would be the perpetrators' ultimate triumph
what eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today
that's what elie wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make their memories part of our collective memory
that's what the holocaust museum does every day on our national mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures and the lessons we've learned from our history
it's the very opposite of silence
but we must also remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation   it's just the beginning
we know that evil has yet to run its course on earth
we've seen it in this century in the mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war
to this day, there are those who insist the holocaust never happened
who perpetrate every form of intolerance   racism and anti-semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more   hatred that degrades its victim and diminishes us all
today, and every day, we have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront these scourges   to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us, or wrap ourselves in the false comfort that others' sufferings are not our own
instead we have the opportunity to make a habit of empathy
to recognize ourselves in each other
to commit ourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take   whether confronting those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can to prevent and end atrocities like those that took place in rwanda, those taking place in darfur
that is my commitment as president
i hope that is yours, as well
it will not be easy
at times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection
but in the final analysis, i believe history gives us cause for hope rather than despair   the hope of a chosen people who have overcome oppression since the days of exodus
of the nation of israel rising from the destruction of the holocaust
of the strong and enduring bonds between our nations
it is the hope, too, of those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the meaning of courage and resilience and dignity
i'm thinking today of a study conducted after the war that found that holocaust survivors living in america actually had a higher birthrate than american jews
what a stunning act of faith   to bring a child in a world that has shown you so much cruelty
to believe that no matter what you have endured, or how much you have lost, in the end, you have a duty to life
we find cause for hope as well in protestant and catholic children attending school together in northern ireland
in hutus and tutsis living side by side, forgiving neighbors who have done the unforgivable
in a movement to save darfur that has thousands of high school and college chapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the washington mall   people of every age and faith and background and race united in common cause with suffering brothers and sisters halfway around the world
those numbers can be our future   our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to make the journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, and ultimately to reconciliation
that is what we mean when we say never again
so today, during this season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the possibility of redemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do what must be done
and may we strive each day, both individually and as a nation, to be among the righteous
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america
well, to president degioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing your family   including jt   appreciate you
we're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls
he's a pretty good-looking young man
to mayor adrian fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance
to representative donna edwards, who is here and represents maryland's 4th district, thank you
to georgetown university students, it is great to be here
well, it is good to be back
i appeared in this room during the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all of you
we're going to talk about the economy today
and i was telling president degioia this may be a slightly longer speech than i usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with so many of our economic challenges
you know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began
and i think that even our critics would agree that at the very least, we've been busy
in just under three months, we've responded to an extraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action   action that's been unprecedented both in terms of its scale and its speed
and i know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once
others believe we haven't done enough
and many americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fit together in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery and ultimately to prosperity
so today, i want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as i can
this is going to be prose, and not poetry
i want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do
i want to update you on the progress we've made, but i also want to be honest about the pitfalls that may still lie ahead
most of all, i want every american to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven by a larger vision of america's future   a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and rising incomes
a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleeting profits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunity at home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries that will shape the 21st century
that's the america i see
that's the america that georgetown is preparing so many of you for
that is the future that i know that we can have
now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here
recessions are not uncommon
markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many times in our history
but this recession is different
this recession was not caused by a normal downturn in the business cycle
it was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from wall street to washington to main street
as has been widely reported, it started in the housing market
during the course of the decade, the formula for buying a house changed
instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many americans found that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could not support
others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quick profit
the reason these loans were so readily available was that wall street saw big profits to be made
investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguing that by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced
and credit agencies that are supposed to help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safest rating when they should have been labeled buyer beware
no one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the risks were
but since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just kept buying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having to take any of the ultimate responsibility
banks took on more debt than they could handle
the government-chartered companies fannie mae and freddie mac, whose traditional mandate was to help support traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars of these securities
aig, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that was very profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financial instruments that supposedly insured these securities
everybody was making record profits   except the wealth created was real only on paper
and as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability or oversight from anyone in washington
then the housing bubble burst
home prices fell
people began to default on their subprime mortgages
and the value of all those loans and securities plummeted
banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buy them
greed gave way to fear
investors pulled their money out of the market
large financial institutions that didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed
other banks held on tight to their money and simply stopped lending
now, this is when the crisis spread from wall street to main street
after all, the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a college education
it's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll
so when banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers
when laid-off workers had less money to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers
when people couldn't get a car loan, a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse
when people couldn't get home loans, the crisis in the housing market only deepened
because the infected securities were being traded worldwide and other nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global
and when other nations can't afford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further
so this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office
so our most urgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and do everything we can to prevent a larger collapse
and since the problems we face are all working off each other to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economic crisis simultaneously
the first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy
so the federal reserve did this by dramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment
my administration and congress boosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history
it's a plan that's already in the process of saving or creating 3
5 million jobs over the next two years
it's putting money directly into people's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks across america
and to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own
now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending, that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should be cutting instead of increasing spending right now
so i want to tackle this argument head on
to begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do in the middle of a recession is to cut back on spending
you see, when this recession began, many families sat around the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back
and so have many businesses
and this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction
but if everybody   if everybody   if every family in america, if every business in america cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy gets even worse
that's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulate demand
that's exactly what we're doing right now
second, i absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix
but the fact is that this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit
as i'll discuss in a moment, the key to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health care costs   not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall
so the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis
the second step has been to heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it
the heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stopped lending money
in a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those bad mortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did have because they were afraid that no one would pay it back
it's for this reason that the last administration used what they called the troubled asset relief program, or tarp, to provide these banks with temporary financial assistance in order to get them lending again
now, i understand that tarp is not popular, and i have to say that i don't agree with some of the ways the tarp program was managed, but i do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with the capital and the confidence necessary to start lending again
that's the purpose of the stress tests that will soon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks
ideally, these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks
but where that's not possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will hold accountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support to clean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution that can serve our people and our economy
of course, there are some who differ with our approach
on the one hand, there are some who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these banks fail   especially since in many cases it was their bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place
but whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of months and months   years of low growth, years of low job creation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfront action
and although there are a lot of americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks   one of my most frequent questions in the letters that i get from constituents is, where's my bailout
and i understand the sentiment
it makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses
so that's a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth
that's why we have to fix the banks
now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the banking system, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it
this is essentially the nationalization argument that some of you may have heard
and the argument says that the federal government should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the way that the fdic currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do so is yet another example of washington coddling wall street   why aren't you tougher on the banks
so let me be clear
the reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or political judgment we've made about government involvement in banks
it's certainly not because of any concern we have for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess
rather, it's because we believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in the end, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence
governments should practice the same principle as doctors
first, do no harm
so rest assured   we will do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayers and to the broader economy
to that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we've launched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the old loans and securities   the so-called toxic assets   that are also preventing our banks from lending money
now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by these toxic assets that are clogging the financial system
aig, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurance company, as i mentioned   and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets, essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entire financial system and freeze lending even more
and that's why, as frustrating as it is   and i promise you, nobody is more frustrated than me with aig   i promise   we had to provide support for aig, because the entire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if aig went into a liquidation bankruptcy
it's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financial institutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don't pose systemic risks   and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn't induce panic in the financial system   and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonus contracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim
this is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the banking system, where more than half of all lending in america actually takes place
to do this, we've started a program that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans and student loans
and to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four million responsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes
in a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of chrysler and general motors, two companies with an important place in our history and a large footprint in our economy   but two companies that have also fallen on hard times
late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them over as they worked to develop viable business plans
unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, so we've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through
and by the way, we owed that not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to the hundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance   entire towns, entire communities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry
now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, chrysler will find a viable partner and gm will develop a business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from american taxpayer
in the meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for american cars and provide relief for autoworkers and their communities
and we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century american auto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward a clean-energy future
finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, i went to the meeting of the g20 nations in london the other week
each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand
all agreed to pursue tougher regulatory reforms
we also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the international monetary fund   which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all the major economies   so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerable populations
that's not just charity
because america's success depends on whether other nations have the ability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets
we pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end
and we decided to meet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary
so that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months
all of these actions   the recovery act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank credit market, the auto plan, and our work at the g20   all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle
they've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businesses and to help families and businesses ride out the storm
and taken together, these actions are starting to generate signs of economic progress
because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs
clean energy companies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficient windows to new roads and highways
our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number of homeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is like putting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket
our program to support the market for auto loans and student loans has started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks
and small businesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months
now, this is all welcome and encouraging news
it does not mean the hard times are over
2009 will continue to be a difficult year for america's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost their jobs
the severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before it ends
the market will continue to rise and fall
credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should
the process for restructuring aig and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopular choices
we are not finished yet on that front
and all of this means that there's much more work to be done
but all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort from this administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts
but even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm belief that our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again
even as we clean up balance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring   all that's going to happen   we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that led us to this point
it is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rules and regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy
it is not sustainable to have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector that was based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets
it's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000
that's just not a sustainable model for long-term prosperity
for even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the last decade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity
the crushing burden that the rising cost of health care is placing on families and businesses
the failure of our education system to prepare our workers for a new age
the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries and technologies while we   we remain addicted to foreign oil
the growing debt that we're passing on to our children
even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century
so we've got a lot of work to do
now, there's a parable at the end of the sermon on the mount that tells the story of two men
the first built his house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit
but the second is known as the wise man, for when the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not
for it was founded upon a rock
it was founded upon a rock
we cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand
we must build our house upon a rock
we must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity   a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest
where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad
it's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century another american century
number one, new rules for wall street that will reward drive and innovation, not reckless risk-taking
number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive
number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobs and new industries
number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families and businesses
and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for future generations
that's the new foundation we must build
that's our house built upon a rock
that must be our future   and my administration's policies are designed to achieve that future
let me talk about each of these steps in turn
the first step we will take to build this foundation is to reform the outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place
it is time to lay down tough new rules of the road for wall street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again
just as after the great depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules
create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse
rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance  a novel concept
rules that protect typical american families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k)
so we've already begun to work with congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework   and i expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out
the second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21st century economy
you know, in the 20th century, the g
bill helped send a generation to college
for decades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economic growth
but in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers
that's why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century
by 2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world
that is the goal that we have set and we intend to do
to meet that goal, we have to start early
so we've already dramatically expanded early childhood education
we are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps
we're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathways for advancement
and i've asked every american to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for every american, even those who attend georgetown
and, by the way, one of the changes that i would like to see   and i'm going to be talking about this in weeks to come   is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things   engineers, scientists, innovators
for so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who can manipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations
and that's good, we need some of that
but you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are building and making things that we can export to other countries
now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions of new jobs and new industries
we all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will lead the 21st century
yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future
i don't know about you, but i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders
i think it's time for america to lead again
so the investments we made in the recovery act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years
and we are putting americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time
now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy
there are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't even be talking about such a transition until the economy recovers
and they are right that we have to take into account the costs of transition
transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy
but we can no longer delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place
that needs to be done now
if businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll start investing in clean energy now
and pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, and workers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars
investors will put some money into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it
that's how we can grow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time
now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businesses and government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums
one and a half million americans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis
major american corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts
small businesses are closing their doors
we can't allow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy
and that's why our recovery act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that can save money and lives and reduce medical error
that's why we've made the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control
and included in the budgets that just passed congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality health care affordable for every american
so i'm looking forward in the next few months to working with both parties in congress to make this reform a reality
we can get this done   and we have to get it done
now, fixing our health care system will   will require resources
it's not going to be free
but in my budget we've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specific savings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all
in fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget, because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economy recovers
already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade
we need to do more, but we've already done that
we've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and save the government $40 billion
we need to do more, but that's an important start
secretary gates recently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making america safer
we need to do more, but that proposal by secretary gates is right on target
we will end education programs that don't work, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our medicare program
altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a century ago
and as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we will be announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need so we can make room for the things that we do need
that's what we're doing now
of course, i realize that for some, this isn't enough
i know there's a criticism out there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda while mortgaging our children's future
you've heard the argument
well, let me make three points
first, as i said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession this severe is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the world are cutting back on their spending
so as serious as our deficit and debt problems are   and they are very serious   major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not on the short-term
and that's exactly what we've done
second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we so desperately need to generate long-term prosperity
that's the argument that some critics have made
well, you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that
you're proposing education investments, you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit
look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spending money to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to work in some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they're thinking about the long term   so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future
if we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't invest now in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in two or five or 10 years down the road
if we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're right back where we are today
and i can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-term budget situation
that's the second point
third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new
it has been building dramatically over the past eight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increased costs of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards
this structural gap in our budget, between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only get worse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path
but let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cutting the budget for the national endowment for the arts
that's just not true
along with defense and interest on the national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like medicare, medicaid, and social security   all of which get more and more expensive every year
so if we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and i do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionary budget   which we've already begun   we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform
now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costs across the system, including in medicare and medicaid
so make no mistake, health care reform is entitlement reform
that's not just my opinion   that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants at the fiscal responsibility summit that we held at the white house in february
and that's one of the reasons why i firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year
once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put social security on firmer footing
it's time for both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for future generations
and we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shutting down corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe
all of these efforts will require tough choices
all these efforts will require compromise
but the difficulties can't serve as an excuse for inaction   not anymore   which brings me to one final point i'd like to make today
i've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning
but we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system
for too long, too many in washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day
there's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real problems
there's also an impatience that characterizes this town   an attention span that has only grown shorter with the 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers
when a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding to the tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to something else, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way
this can't be one of those times
the challenges are too great
the stakes are too high
i know how difficult it is for members of congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now
i'd love if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time
it's more than most congresses and most presidents have to deal with in a lifetime
but we have been called to govern in extraordinary times
and that requires an extraordinary sense of responsibility   to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here
there is no doubt that times are still tough
by no means are we out of the woods just yet
but from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope
and beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an america's future that is far different than our troubled economic past
it's an america teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that light the world once more   a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live the dream they've heard so much about
that is the house upon the rock   proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms
and we will not finish it in one year
we will not finish it in many
but if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, if we come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against the disappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then i have no doubt that this house will stand and the dream of our founders will live on in our time
thank you
god bless you
god bless the united states of america
thank you
thank you, guys
let me say multinational force iraq, multinational corps iraq, multinational security transition command iraq first corps, america's corp band
thanks to all of you
listen, i am so honored
we love you
president obama
i love you back
i am honored   i'm honored and grateful to be with all of you
and i'm not going to talk long because i want to shake as many hands as i can
and i've been talking all week
but there's a couple of things i want to say
number one, thank you
you know, when i was at camp lejeune i spoke about what it means for america to see our best and brightest, our finest young men and women serve us
and what i said then is something that i want to repeat to you, which is
you have performed brilliantly in every mission that has been given to you
under enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty and politics, you've kept your eyes focused on just doing your job
and because of that, every mission that's been assigned   from getting rid of saddam, to reducing violence, to stabilizing the country, to facilitating elections   you have given iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country
that is an extraordinary achievement, and for that you have the thanks of the american people
that's point number one
point number two is, this is going to be a critical period, these next 18 months
i was just discussing this with your commander, but i think it's something that all of you know
it is time for us to transition to the iraqis
they need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty
and in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations
they're going to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutional means and legal means
they are going to have to focus on providing government services that encourage confidence among their citizens
all those things they have to do
we can't do it for them
but what we can do is make sure that we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed to their success, that in terms of training their security forces, training their civilian forces in order to achieve a more effective government, they know that they have a steady partner with us
and so just as we thank you for what you've already accomplished, i want to say thank you because you will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure that iraq is stable, that it is not a safe haven for terrorists, that it is a good neighbor and a good ally, and we can start bringing our folks home
so now is not the time to lose focus
we have to be even more focused than we've been in order to achieve success
the last point i want to make is i know how hard it's been on a lot of you
you've been away from your families, many of you for multiple rotations
you've seen buddies of yours injured and you remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice
there are probably some people here who have seen children born and have been missing watching them grow up
there are many of you who have listened to your spouse and the extraordinary sacrifices that they have to make when you're gone
and so i want you to know that michelle and myself are doing everything   are doing everything we can to provide additional support for military families
the federal budget that i have introduced increases support for military families
we are going to do everything required to make sure that the commitment we make to our veterans is met, and that people don't have to fight for what they have earned as a consequence of their service
the main point i want to make is we have not forgotten what you have already done, we are grateful for what you will do, and as long as i am in the white house, you are going to get the support that you need and the thanks that you deserve from a grateful nation
so thank you very much everybody
god bless you
god bless the united states of america
speaker, madam deputy speaker, distinguished members, i am honored to speak in this chamber, and i am committed to renewing the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people
this is my first trip overseas as president of the united states
i've been to the g20 summit in london, and the nato summit in strasbourg, and the european union summit in prague
some people have asked me if i chose to continue my travels to ankara and istanbul to send a message to the world
and my answer is simple
evet   yes
turkey is a critical ally
turkey is an important part of europe
and turkey and the united states must stand together   and work together   to overcome the challenges of our time
this morning i had the great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder of your republic
and i was deeply impressed by this beautiful memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history
but it is also clear that the greatest monument to ataturk's life is not something that can be cast in stone and marble
his greatest legacy is turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is the work that this assembly carries on today
this future was not easily assured, it was not guaranteed
at the end of world war i, turkey could have succumbed to the foreign powers that were trying to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancient empire
but turkey chose a different future
you freed yourself from foreign control, and you founded a republic that commands the respect of the united states and the wider world
and there is a simple truth to this story
turkey's democracy is your own achievement
it was not forced upon you by any outside power, nor did it come without struggle and sacrifice
turkey draws strength from both the successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of turks that makes new progress for your people
now, my country's democracy has its own story
the general who led america in revolution and governed as our first president was, as many of you know, george washington
and like you, we built a grand monument to honor our founding father   a towering obelisk that stands in the heart of the capital city that bears washington's name
i can see the washington monument from the window of the white house every day
it took decades to build
there were frequent delays
over time, more and more people contributed to help make this monument the inspiring structure that still stands tall today
among those who came to our aid were friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to washington and the country he helped to found
and one of those tributes came from istanbul
ottoman sultan abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helped to build the washington monument
inscribed in the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words
so as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries
over 150 years have passed since those words were carved into marble
our nations have changed in many ways
but our friendship is strong, and our alliance endures
it is a friendship that flourished in the years after world war ii, when president truman committed our nation to the defense of turkey's freedom and sovereignty, and turkey committed itself into the nato alliance
turkish troops have served by our side from korea to kosovo to kabul
together, we withstood the great test of the cold war
trade between our nations has steadily advanced
so has cooperation in science and research
the ties among our people have deepened, as well, and more and more americans of turkish origin live and work and succeed within our borders
and as a basketball fan, i've even noticed that hedo turkoglu and mehmet okur have got some pretty good basketball games
the united states and turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be expected   no two nations do
but we have stood together through many challenges over the last 60 years
and because of the strength of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both america and turkey are stronger and the world is more secure
now, our two democracies are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges
an economic crisis that recognizes no borders
extremism that leads to the killing of innocent men and women and children
strains on our energy supply and a changing climate
the proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons
and the persistence of tragic conflict
these are the great tests of our young century
and the choices that we make in the coming years will determine whether the future will be shaped by fear or by freedom
by poverty or by prosperity
by strife or by a just, secure and lasting peace
this much is certain
no one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have a stake in overcoming them
that is why we must listen to one another, and seek common ground
that is why we must build on our mutual interests, and rise above our differences
we are stronger when we act together
that is the message that i've carried with me throughout this trip to europe
that is the message that i delivered when i had the privilege of meeting with your president and with your prime minister
that will be the approach of the united states of america going forward
already, america and turkey are working with the g20 on an unprecedented response to an unprecedented economic crisis
now, this past week, we came together to ensure that the world's largest economies take strong and coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of credit
to reject the pressures of protectionism, and to extend a hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this downturn
and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that the world never faces a crisis like this again
as we go forward, the united states and turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve prosperity for our people
the president and i this morning talked about expanding the ties of commerce and trade
there's enormous opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs
and we can increase new sources to not only free ourselves from dependence of other energies   other countries' energy sources, but also to combat climate change
we should build on our clean technology fund to leverage efficiency and renewable energy investments in turkey
and to power markets in turkey and europe, the united states will continue to support your central role as an east-west corridor for oil and natural gas
this economic cooperation only reinforces the common security that europe and the united states share with turkey as a nato ally, and the common values that we share as democracies
so in meeting the challenges of the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a europe that is truly united, peaceful and free
so let me be clear
the united states strongly supports turkey's bid to become a member of the european union
we speak not as members of the eu, but as close friends of both turkey and europe
turkey has been a resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and european institutions
turkey is bound to europe by more than the bridges over the bosphorous
centuries of shared history, culture, and commerce bring you together
europe gains by the diversity of ethnicity, tradition and faith   it is not diminished by it
and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe's foundation once more
now, of course, turkey has its own responsibilities
and you've made important progress towards membership
but i also know that turkey has pursued difficult political reforms not simply because it's good for eu membership, but because it's right for turkey
in the last several years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the right to counsel
you've reformed the penal code and strengthened laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly
you've lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting kurdish, and the world noted with respect the important signal sent through a new state kurdish television station
these achievements have created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that should be sustained
for democracies cannot be static   they must move forward
freedom of religion and expression lead to a strong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is why steps like reopening halki seminary will send such an important signal inside turkey and beyond
an enduring commitment to the rule of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from justice for all people
robust minority rights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens
i say this as the president of a country that not very long ago made it hard for somebody who looks like me to vote, much less be president of the united states
but it is precisely that capacity to change that enriches our countries
every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation
this work is never over
that's why, in the united states, we recently ordered the prison at guantanamo bay closed
that's why we prohibited   without exception or equivocation   the use of torture
all of us have to change
and sometimes change is hard
another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past
the united states is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history
facing the washington monument that i spoke of is a memorial of abraham lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after washington led our revolution
our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of native americans
human endeavor is by its nature imperfect
history is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight
each country must work through its past
and reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future
i know there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 1915
and while there's been a good deal of commentary about my views, it's really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past
and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest, open and constructive
we've already seen historic and courageous steps taken by turkish and armenian leaders
these contacts hold out the promise of a new day
an open border would return the turkish and armenian people to a peaceful and prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations
so i want you to know that the united states strongly supports the full normalization of relations between turkey and armenia
it is a cause worth working towards
it speaks to turkey's leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region to have normal and peaceful relations with all the south caucasus nations
and to advance that peace, you can play a constructive role in helping to resolve the nagorno-karabakh conflict, which has continued for far too long
advancing peace also includes the disputes that persist in the eastern mediterranean
and here there's a cause for hope
the two cypriot leaders have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiations under the united nations good offices mission
the united states is willing to offer all the help sought by the parties as they work towards a just and lasting settlement that reunifies cyprus into a bizonal and bicommunal federation
these efforts speak to one part of the critical region that surrounds turkey
and when we consider the challenges before us, on issue after issue, we share common goals
in the middle east, we share the goal of a lasting peace between israel and its neighbors
let me be clear
the united states strongly supports the goal of two states, israel and palestine, living side by side in peace and security
that is a goal shared by palestinians, israelis, and people of goodwill around the world
that is a goal that the parties agreed to in the road map and at annapolis
that is a goal that i will actively pursue as president of the united states
we know the road ahead will be difficult
both israelis and palestinians must take steps that are necessary to build confidence and trust
both israelis and palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made
both must overcome longstanding passions and the politics of the moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace
the united states and turkey can help the palestinians and israelis make this journey
like the united states, turkey has been a friend and partner in israel's quest for security
and like the united states, you seek a future of opportunity and statehood for the palestinians
so now, working together, we must not give into pessimism and mistrust
we must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by supporting negotiations between syria and israel
we must extend a hand to those palestinians who are in need, while helping them strengthen their own institutions
we must reject the use of terror, and recognize that israel's security concerns are legitimate
the peace of the region will also be advanced if iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions
now, as i made clear in prague yesterday, no one is served by the spread of nuclear weapons, least of all turkey
you live in a difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security of this nation well
this part of the world has known enough violence
it has known enough hatred
it does not need a race for an ever-more powerful tool of destruction
now, i have made it clear to the people and leaders of the islamic republic of iran that the united states seeks engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect
we want iran to play its rightful role in the community of nations
iran is a great civilization
we want them to engage in the economic and political integration that brings prosperity and security
but iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people
so both turkey and the united states support a secure and united iraq that does not serve as a safe haven for terrorists
i know there were differences about whether to go to war
there were differences within my own country, as well
but now we must come together as we end this war responsibly, because the future of iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader region
as i've already announced, and many of you are aware, the united states will remove our combat brigades by the end of next august, while working with the iraqi government as they take responsibility for security
and we will work with iraq, turkey, and all iraq's neighbors, to forge a new dialogue that reconciles differences and advances our common security
make no mistake, though
iraq, turkey, and the united states face a common threat from terrorism
that includes the al qaeda terrorists who have sought to drive iraqis apart and destroy their country
that includes the pkk
there is no excuse for terror against any nation
as president, and as a nato ally, i pledge that you will have our support against the terrorist activities of the pkk or anyone else
these efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between turkey, the iraqi government, and iraq's kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunity and democracy for the kurdish population here inside turkey
finally, we share the common goal of denying al qaeda a safe haven in pakistan or afghanistan
the world has come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al qaeda terrorists plot further attacks
that's why we are committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda
that is why we are increasing our efforts to train afghans to sustain their own security, and to reconcile former adversaries
that's why we are increasing our support for the people of afghanistan and pakistan, so that we stand on the side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the promise of a better life
turkey has been a true partner
your troops were among the first in the international security assistance force
you have sacrificed much in this endeavor
now we must achieve our goals together
i appreciate that you've offered to help us train and support afghan security forces, and expand opportunity across the region
together, we can rise to meet this challenge like we have so many before
i know there have been difficulties these last few years
i know that the trust that binds the united states and turkey has been strained, and i know that strain is shared in many places where the muslim faith is practiced
so let me say this as clearly as i can
the united states is not, and will never be, at war with islam
in fact, our partnership with the muslim world is critical not just in rolling back the violent ideologies that people of all faiths reject, but also to strengthen opportunity for all its people
i also want to be clear that america's relationship with the muslim community, the muslim world, cannot, and will not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism
we seek broader engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect
we will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek common ground
we will be respectful, even when we do not agree
we will convey our deep appreciation for the islamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world   including in my own country
the united states has been enriched by muslim americans
many other americans have muslims in their families or have lived in a muslim-majority country
i know, because i am one of them
above all, above all we will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future
i want to help more children get the education that they need to succeed
we want to promote health care in places where people are vulnerable
we want to expand the trade and investment that can bring prosperity for all people
in the months ahead, i will present specific programs to advance these goals
our focus will be on what we can do, in partnership with people across the muslim world, to advance our common hopes and our common dreams
and when people look back on this time, let it be said of america that we extended the hand of friendship to all people
there's an old turkish proverb
you cannot put out fire with flames
america knows this
turkey knows this
there's some who must be met by force, they will not compromise
but force alone cannot solve our problems, and it is no alternative to extremism
the future must belong to those who create, not those who destroy
that is the future we must work for, and we must work for it together
i know there are those who like to debate turkey's future
they see your country at the crossroads of continents, and touched by the currents of history
they know that this has been a place where civilizations meet, and different peoples come together
they wonder whether you will be pulled in one direction or another
but i believe here is what they don't understand
turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center of things
this is not where east and west divide   this is where they come together
in the beauty of your culture
in the richness of your history
in the strength of your democracy
in your hopes for tomorrow
i am honored to stand here with you   to look forward to the future that we must reach for together   and to reaffirm america's commitment to our strong and enduring friendship
thank you very much
thank you
thank you
thank you so much
thank you for this wonderful welcome
thank you to the people of prague
thank you to the people of the czech republic
today, i'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city, in the center of europe
and, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, i am also proud to be the man who brought michelle obama to prague
to mr
president, mr
prime minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality
and to the people of the czech republic, thank you for your friendship to the united states
i've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the czech people in my hometown of chicago
behind me is a statue of a hero of the czech people   tomas masaryk
in 1918, after america had pledged its support for czech independence, masaryk spoke to a crowd in chicago that was estimated to be over 100,000
i don't think i can match his record   but i am honored to follow his footsteps from chicago to prague
for over a thousand years, prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place
you've known war and peace
you've seen empires rise and fall
you've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politics and in poetry
through it all, the people of prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and defining their own destiny
and this city   this golden city which is both ancient and youthful   stands as a living monument to your unconquerable spirit
when i was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances
few people would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the president of the united states
few people would have predicted that an american president would one day be permitted to speak to an audience like this in prague
few would have imagined that the czech republic would become a free nation, a member of nato, a leader of a united europe
those ideas would have been dismissed as dreams
we are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could not change
we're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a right for all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like
we are here today because of the prague spring   because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people
we are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of a new day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long
sametová revoluce   the velvet revolution taught us many things
it showed us that peaceful protest could shake the foundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology
it showed us that small countries can play a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts
and it proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon
that's why i'm speaking to you in the center of a europe that is peaceful, united and free   because ordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not
they believed that walls could come down
that peace could prevail
we are here today because americans and czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible
now, we share this common history
but now this generation   our generation   cannot stand still
we, too, have a choice to make
as the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected
and we've seen events move faster than our ability to control them   a global economy in crisis, a changing climate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons
none of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily
but all of them demand that we listen to one another and work together
that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences
and that we reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart
that is the work that we must carry on
that is the work that i have come to europe to begin
to renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders
that means investments to create new jobs
that means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth
that means a change in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis
and we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to those emerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have had very little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the international monetary fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody   everybody   receives some assistance
now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy
together, we must confront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of new sources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part
and i pledge to you that in this global effort, the united states is now ready to lead
to provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance
nato was founded 60 years ago, after communism took over czechoslovakia
that was when the free world learned too late that it could not afford division
so we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known
and we should   stood shoulder to shoulder   year after year, decade after decade   until an iron curtain was lifted, and freedom spread like flowing water
this marks the 10th year of nato membership for the czech republic
and i know that many times in the 20th century, decisions were made without you at the table
great powers let you down, or determined your destiny without your voice being heard
i am here to say that the united states will never turn its back on the people of this nation
we are bound by shared values, shared history   we are bound by shared values and shared history and the enduring promise of our alliance
nato's article v states it clearly
an attack on one is an attack on all
that is a promise for our time, and for all time
the people of the czech republic kept that promise after america was attacked
thousands were killed on our soil, and nato responded
nato's mission in afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of the atlantic
we are targeting the same al qaeda terrorists who have struck from new york to london, and helping the afghan people take responsibility for their future
we are demonstrating that free nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security
and i want you to know that we honor the sacrifices of the czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost
but no alliance can afford to stand still
we must work together as nato members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from
we must strengthen our cooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangers that recognize no borders
and we must pursue constructive relations with russia on issues of common concern
now, one of those issues that i'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to the peace of the world   that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century
the existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the cold war
no nuclear war was fought between the united states and the soviet union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light
cities like prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist
today, the cold war has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not
in a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up
more nations have acquired these weapons
testing has continued
black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound
the technology to build a bomb has spread
terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one
our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold
now, understand, this matters to people everywhere
one nuclear weapon exploded in one city   be it new york or moscow, islamabad or mumbai, tokyo or tel aviv, paris or prague   could kill hundreds of thousands of people
and no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be   for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival
some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked   that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction
such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable
just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century
and as nuclear power   as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the united states has a moral responsibility to act
we cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it
so today, i state clearly and with conviction america's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons
i'm not naive
this goal will not be reached quickly   perhaps not in my lifetime
it will take patience and persistence
but now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change
we have to insist, yes, we can
now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on
first, the united states will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons
to put an end to cold war thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same
make no mistake
as long as these weapons exist, the united states will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies   including the czech republic
but we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal
to reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty with the russians this year
president medvedev and i began this process in london, and will seek a new agreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold
and this will set the stage for further cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor
to achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue u
ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty
after more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned
and to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the united states will seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons
if we are serious about stopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create them
that's the first step
second, together we will strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a basis for cooperation
the basic bargain is sound
countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy
to strengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles
we need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections
we need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause
and we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation
that must be the right of every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peaceful programs
and no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules
we must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and to advance peace opportunity for all people
but we go forward with no illusions
some countries will break the rules
that's why we need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences
just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to address this threat
north korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long range missiles
this provocation underscores the need for action   not just this afternoon at the u
security council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons
rules must be binding
violations must be punished
words must mean something
the world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons
now is the time for a strong international response   now is the time for a strong international response, and north korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through threats and illegal weapons
all nations must come together to build a stronger, global regime
and that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the north koreans to change course
iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon
my administration will seek engagement with iran based on mutual interests and mutual respect
we believe in dialogue
but in that dialogue we will present a clear choice
we want iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically
we will support iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections
that's a path that the islamic republic can take
or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nuclear arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all
so let me be clear
iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the united states, but to iran's neighbors and our allies
the czech republic and poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles
as long as the threat from iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven
if the iranian threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in europe will be removed
so, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon
this is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security
one terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction
al qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it
and we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe
to protect our people, we must act with a sense of purpose without delay
so today i am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years
we will set new standards, expand our cooperation with russia, pursue new partnerships to lock down these sensitive materials
we must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade
because this threat will be lasting, we should come together to turn efforts such as the proliferation security initiative and the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism into durable international institutions
and we should start by having a global summit on nuclear security that the united states will host within the next year
now, i know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda
there are those who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences among nations
and there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worth setting a goal that seems impossible to achieve
but make no mistake
we know where that road leads
when nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens
when we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp
we know the path when we choose fear over hope
to denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do
that's how wars begin
that's where human progress ends
there is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted
we must confront it not by splitting apart but by standing together as free nations, as free people
i know that a call to arms can stir the souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down
but that is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together
those are the voices that still echo through the streets of prague
those are the ghosts of 1968
those were the joyful sounds of the velvet revolution
those were the czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot
human destiny will be what we make of it
and here in prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a better future
let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it
together we can do it
thank you very much
thank you, prague
thank you so much
good afternoon
bon après-midi
and guten tag
it is a great honor for me to be here in europe, to be here in strasbourg
i want to make just a few acknowledgements
i want to thank the president of france, nicolas sarkozy, for being such a terrific friend
i want to thank his wife, madam sarkozy
they just hosted us at the palace and could not have been more gracious
i want to thank the charge d'affaires, mark pekala, and his wife, maria, who were helping to organize us
vincent carver, who's the counsel general in strasbourg
and i want to thank the mayor of strasbourg, roland ries, for his hospitality
it is wonderful to be here with all of you and to have an opportunity not only to speak to you but also to take some questions
you know, oftentimes during these foreign trips you see everything from behind a window, and what we thought was important was for me to have an opportunity to not only speak with you but also to hear from you, because that's ultimately how we can learn about each other
but before i take some questions, i hope you don't mind me making a few remarks about my country and yours
the relationship between the united states and the relationship between europe
strasbourg has been known throughout history as a city at the crossroads
over thousands of years, you straddled many kingdoms and many cultures
two rivers are joined here
two religions have flourished in your churches
three languages comprise an ancient oath that bears the city's name
you served as a center of industry and commerce, a seat of government and education, where goethe studied and pasteur taught and gutenberg imagined his printing press
so it's fitting because we find ourselves at a crossroads as well   all of us   for we've arrived at a moment where each nation and every citizen must choose at last how we respond to a world that has grown smaller and more connected than at any time in its existence
we've known for a long time that the revolutions in communications and technology that took place in the 20th century would hold out enormous promise for the 21st century   the promise of broader prosperity and mobility
of new breakthroughs and discoveries that could help us lead richer and fuller lives
but the same forces that have brought us closer together have also given rise to new dangers that threaten to tear our world apart   dangers that cannot be contained by the nearest border or the furthest ocean
even with the cold war now over, the spread of nuclear weapons or the theft of nuclear material could lead to the extermination of any city on the planet
and this weekend in prague, i will lay out an agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons
we also know that the pollution from cars in boston or from factories in beijing are melting the ice caps in the arctic, and that that will disrupt weather patterns everywhere
the terrorists who struck in london, in new york, plotted in distant caves and simple apartments much closer to your home
and the reckless speculation of bankers that has new fueled a global economic downturn that's inflicting pain on workers and families is happening everywhere all across the globe
the economic crisis has proven the fact of our interdependence in the most visible way yet
not more than a generation ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that the inability of somebody to pay for a house in florida could contribute to the failure of the banking system in iceland
today what's difficult to imagine is that we did not act sooner to shape our future
now, there's plenty of blame to go around for what has happened, and the united states certainly shares its   shares blame for what has happened
but every nation bears responsibility for what lies ahead, especially now, for whether it's the recession or climate change, or terrorism, or drug trafficking, poverty, or the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have learned that without a doubt there's no quarter of the globe that can wall itself off from the threats of the 21st century
the one way forward   the only way forward   is through a common and persistent effort to combat fear and want wherever they exist
that is the challenge of our time   and we can not fail to meet it, together
now, we take for granted the peace of a europe that's united, but for centuries strasbourg has been attacked and occupied and claimed by the warring nations of this continent
now, today in this city, the presence of the european parliament and the council of europe stand as symbols of a europe that is united peaceful and free
now, we take this peace and prosperity for granted, but this destination was not easily reached, nor was it predestined
the buildings that are now living monuments to european unity were not drawn from simple blueprints
they were born out of the blood of the first half of the 20th century and the resolve of the second
men and women had to have the imagination to see a better future, and the courage to reach for it
europeans and americans had to have the sense of common purpose to join one another, and the patience and the persistence to see a long twilight struggle through
it was 61 years ago this april that a marshall plan to rebuild europe helped to deliver hope to a continent that had been decimated by war
amid the ashes and the rubble that surrounded so many cities like this one, america joined with you in an unprecedented effort that secured a lasting prosperity not just in europe, but around the world   on both sides of the atlantic
one year later, exactly 60 years ago tomorrow, we ensured our shared security when 12 of our nations signed a treaty in washington that spelled out a simple agreement
an attack on one would be viewed as an attack on all
without firing a single shot, this alliance would prevent the iron curtain from descending on the free nations of western europe
it would lead eventually to the crumbling of a wall in berlin and the end of the communist threat
two decades later, with 28 member nations that stretched from the baltic to the mediterranean, nato remains the strongest alliance that the world has ever known
at the crossroads where we stand today, this shared history gives us hope   but it must not give us rest
this generation cannot stand still
we cannot be content merely to celebrate the achievements of the 20th century, or enjoy the comforts of the 21st century
we must learn from the past to build on its success
we must renew our institutions, our alliances
we must seek the solutions to the challenges of this young century
this is our generation
this is our time
and i am confident that we can meet any challenge as long as we are together
such an effort is never easy
it's always harder to forge true partnerships and sturdy alliances than to act alone, or to wait for the action of somebody else
it's more difficult to break down walls of division than to simply allow our differences to build and our resentments to fester
so we must be honest with ourselves
in recent years we've allowed our alliance to drift
i know that there have been honest disagreements over policy, but we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship
in america, there's a failure to appreciate europe's leading role in the world
instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where america has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive
but in europe, there is an anti-americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious
instead of recognizing the good that america so often does in the world, there have been times where europeans choose to blame america for much of what's bad
on both sides of the atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common
they are not wise
they do not represent the truth
they threaten to widen the divide across the atlantic and leave us both more isolated
they fail to acknowledge the fundamental truth that america cannot confront the challenges of this century alone, but that europe cannot confront them without america
so i've come to europe this week to renew our partnership, one in which america listens and learns from our friends and allies, but where our friends and allies bear their share of the burden
together, we must forge common solutions to our common problems
so let me say this as clearly as i can
america is changing, but it cannot be america alone that changes
we are confronting the greatest economic crisis since world war ii
the only way to confront this unprecedented crisis is through unprecedented coordination
over the last few days, i believe that we have begun that effort
the g20 summit in london was a success of nations coming together, working out their differences, and moving boldly forward
all of us are moving aggressively to restore growth and lending
all of us have agreed to the most substantial overhaul of our international financial system in a generation
no one is exempt
no more will the world's financial players be able to make risky bets at the expense of ordinary people
those days are over
we are ushering a new era of responsibility, and that is something we should all be proud of
as we take these steps, we also affirm that we must not erect new barriers to commerce
that trade wars have no victors
we can't give up on open markets, even as we work to ensure that trade is both free and fair
we cannot forget how many millions that trade has lifted out of poverty and into the middle class
we can't forget that part of the freedom that our nations stood for throughout the cold war was the opportunity that comes from free enterprise and individual liberty
i know it can be tempting to turn inward, and i understand how many people and nations have been left behind by the global economy
and that's why the united states is leading an effort to reach out to people around the world who are suffering, to provide them immediate assistance and to extend support for food security that will help them lift themselves out of poverty
all of us must join together in this effort, not just because it is right, but because by providing assistance to those countries most in need, we will provide new markets, we will drive the growth of the future that lifts all of us up
so it's not just charity
it's a matter of understanding that our fates are tied together   not just the fate of europe and america, but the fate of the entire world
and as we restore our common prosperity, we must stand up for our common security
as we meet here today, nato has still embarked on its first mission overseas in afghanistan, and my administration has just completed a review of our policy in that region
now, i understand that this war has been long
our allies have already contributed greatly to this endeavor
you've sent your sons and daughters to fight alongside ours, and we honor and respect their service and sacrifice
and i also know that there's some who have asked questions about why are we still in afghanistan
what does this mean
what's its purpose
understand we would not deploy our own troops if this mission was not indispensable to our common security
as president, i can tell you there's no decision more difficult, there's no duty more painful, than signing a letter to the family of somebody who has died in war
so i understand that there is doubt about this war in europe
there's doubt at times even in the united states
but know this
the united states of america did not choose to fight a war in afghanistan
we were attacked by an al qaeda network that killed thousands on american soil, including french and germans
along the border of afghanistan and pakistan, those terrorists are still plotting today
and they're   if there is another al qaeda attack, it is just as likely, if not more, that it will be here in europe in a european city
so i've made a commitment to afghanistan, and i've asked our nato partners for more civilian and military support and assistance
we do this with a clear purpose
to root out the terrorists who threaten all of us, to train the afghan people to sustain their own security and to help them advance their own opportunity, and to quicken the day when our troops come home
we have no interest in occupying afghanistan
we have more than enough to do in rebuilding america
but this is a mission that tests whether nations can come together in common purpose on behalf of our common security
that's what we did together in the 20th century
and now we need an alliance that is even stronger than when it brought down a mighty wall in berlin
that's why we applaud france's decision to expand and deepen its participation in nato, just as we support a strong european defense
that's why we welcome croatia and albania into the fold
and that is why we must ensure that nato is equipped and capable of facing down the threats and challenges of this new age
this is one of our central tasks
and we also know that in the 21st century, security is more complex than military power
this is the generation that must also stop the spread of the pollution that is slowly killing our planet, from shrinking coastlines and devastating storms to widespread misery and famine and drought
the effects of climate change are now in plain sight
europe has acted with a seriousness of purpose that this challenge demands
and in the last few months i'm proud to say that america has begun to take unprecedented steps to transform the way that we use energy
we appointed a special envoy to help us lead a global effort to reduce the carbon that we send in the atmosphere
but we all know that time is running out
and that means that america must do more
europe must do more
china and india must do more
rolling back the tide of a warming planet is a responsibility that we have to ourselves, to our children, and all of those who will inherit god's creation long after we are gone
so let us meet that responsibility together
i am confident that we can meet it
but we have to begin today
and let us resolve that when future generations look back on ours, they will be able to say that we did our part to make this world more peaceful
it's perhaps the most difficult work of all to resolve age-old conflicts, to heal ancient hatreds, to dissolve the lines of suspicion between religions and cultures, and people who may not look like us, or have the same faith that we do, or come from the same place
but just because it's difficult does not make the work any less important
it does not absolve us from trying
and to that end, america will sustain our effort to forge and secure a lasting peace between the israelis and the palestinians
i've sent a clear message to the leaders and peoples of iran that while we have real differences, we also have mutual interests, and we seek new engagement based on mutual respect
and it is in that spirit that america and europe must reach out to the vast majority of muslims in our nations and in all nations
we seek only hope of peace and partnership, and the opportunity of a better life
we cannot simply solve these conflicts militarily
we have to open our minds and we have to open our hearts to the differences among us and the commonalities between us
with every threat that we face, a new day is possible
we can't get there alone
as it was in the darkest days after world war ii, when a continent lay in ruins and an atomic cloud had settled over the world, we must make the journey together
we know that transformational change is possible
we know this because of three reasons
first, because, for all our differences, there are certain values that bind us together and reveal our common humanity
the universal longing to live a life free from fear, and free from want
a life marked by dignity and respect and simple justice
our two republics were founded in service of these ideals
in america, it is written into our founding documents as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
in france
liberté   absolutely   egalité, fraternité
our moral authority is derived from the fact that generations of our citizens have fought and bled to uphold these values in our nations and others
and that's why we can never sacrifice them for expedience's sake
that's why i've ordered the closing of the detention center in guantanamo bay
that's why i can stand here today and say without equivocation or exception that the united states of america does not and will not torture
the second way that we can turn challenge into opportunity is through our persistence in the face of difficulty
in an age of instant gratification, it's tempting to believe that every problem can and should be solved in the span of a week
when these problems aren't solved, we conclude that our efforts to solve them must have been in vain
but that's not how progress is made
progress is slow
it comes in fits and starts, because we try and we fail and then we try something else
and when there are setbacks and disappointments we keep going
we hold firm to our core values, and we hold firm to our faith in one another
the third reason we know that we can change this world is because of men and women like the young people who are here today
each time we find ourselves at a crossroads, paralyzed by worn debates and stale thinking, the old ways of doing things, a new generation rises up and shows the way forward
as robert kennedy once told a crowd of students in south africa, it is a revolutionary world that we live in, and thus, it is young people who must take the lead
because young people are unburdened by the biases or prejudices of the past
that is a great privilege of youth
but it's also a tremendous responsibility because it is you who must ultimately decide what we do with this incredible moment in history
we just emerged from an era marked by irresponsibility, and it would be easy to choose the path of selfishness or apathy, of blame or division
but that is a danger that we cannot afford
the challenges are too great
it is a revolutionary world that we live in, and history shows us that we can do improbable, sometimes impossible things
we stand here in a city that used to stand at the center of european conflict
only now it is the center of european union
we did that together
now we must not give up on one another
we must renew this relationship for a new generation, in a new century
we must hold firm to our common values, hold firm to our faith in one another
together, i'm confident that we can achieve the promise of a new day
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much
thank you very much
to general haley for the outstanding work he is doing
thank you so much
good morning marines
good morning camp lejeune
good morning jacksonville
thank you for that outstanding welcome
i want to thank lieutenant general hejlik for hosting me here today
i also want to acknowledge all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines serving in iraq and afghanistan
that includes the camp lejeune marines now serving with – or soon joining – the second marine expeditionary force in iraq
those with special purpose marine air ground task force in afghanistan
and those among the 8,000 marines who are preparing to deploy to afghanistan
we have you in our prayers
we pay tribute to your service
we thank you and your families for all that you do for america
and i want all of you to know that there is no higher honor or greater responsibility than serving as your commander-in-chief
i also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge ryan crocker, who recently completed his service as our ambassador to iraq
throughout his career, ryan always took on the toughest assignments
he is an example of the very best that this nation has to offer, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude
he carried on his work with an extraordinary degree of cooperation with two of our finest generals – general david petraeus, and general ray odierno – who will be critical in carrying forward the strategy that i will outline today
next month will mark the sixth anniversary of the war in iraq
by any measure, this has already been a long war
for the men and women of america's armed forces – and for your families – this war has been one of the most extraordinary chapters of service in the history of our nation
you have endured tour after tour after tour of duty
you have known the dangers of combat and the lonely distance of loved ones
you have fought against tyranny and disorder
you have bled for your best friends and for unknown iraqis
and you have borne an enormous burden for your fellow citizens, while extending a precious opportunity to the people of iraq
under tough circumstances, the men and women of the united states military have served with honor, and succeeded beyond any expectation
today, i have come to speak to you about how the war in iraq will end
to understand where we need to go in iraq, it is important for the american people to understand where we now stand
thanks in great measure to your service, the situation in iraq has improved
violence has been reduced substantially from the horrific sectarian killing of 2006 and 2007
al qaeda in iraq has been dealt a serious blow by our troops and iraq's security forces, and through our partnership with sunni arabs
the capacity of iraq's security forces has improved, and iraq's leaders have taken steps toward political accommodation
the relative peace and strong participation in january's provincial elections sent a powerful message to the world about how far iraqis have come in pursuing their aspirations through a peaceful political process
but let there be no doubt
iraq is not yet secure, and there will be difficult days ahead
violence will continue to be a part of life in iraq
too many fundamental political questions about iraq's future remain unresolved
too many iraqis are still displaced or destitute
declining oil revenues will put an added strain on a government that has had difficulty delivering basic services
not all of iraq's neighbors are contributing to its security
some are working at times to undermine it
and even as iraq's government is on a surer footing, it is not yet a full partner – politically and economically – in the region, or with the international community
in short, today there is a renewed cause for hope in iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging foundation
on my first full day in office, i directed my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of our strategy in iraq to determine the best way to strengthen that foundation, while strengthening american national security
i have listened to my secretary of defense, the joint chiefs of staff, and commanders on the ground
we have acted with careful consideration of events on the ground
with respect for the security agreements between the united states and iraq
and with a critical recognition that the long-term solution in iraq must be political – not military
because the most important decisions that have to be made about iraq's future must now be made by iraqis
we have also taken into account the simple reality that america can no longer afford to see iraq in isolation from other priorities
we face the challenge of refocusing on afghanistan and pakistan
of relieving the burden on our military
and of rebuilding our struggling economy – and these are challenges that we will meet
today, i can announce that our review is complete, and that the united states will pursue a new strategy to end the war in iraq through a transition to full iraqi responsibility
this strategy is grounded in a clear and achievable goal shared by the iraqi people and the american people
an iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant
to achieve that goal, we will work to promote an iraqi government that is just, representative, and accountable, and that provides neither support nor safe-haven to terrorists
we will help iraq build new ties of trade and commerce with the world
and we will forge a partnership with the people and government of iraq that contributes to the peace and security of the region
what we will not do is let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals
we cannot rid iraq of all who oppose america or sympathize with our adversaries
we cannot police iraq's streets until they are completely safe, nor stay until iraq's union is perfected
we cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that has put a strain on our military, and will cost the american people nearly a trillion dollars
america's men and women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, year after year, to give the iraqis this chance to choose a better future
now, we must ask the iraqi people to seize it
the first part of this strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades from iraq
as a candidate for president, i made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we've made and protect our troops
those consultations are now complete, and i have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months
let me say this as plainly as i can
by august 31, 2010, our combat mission in iraq will end
as we carry out this drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civilians in iraq
we will proceed carefully, and i will consult closely with my military commanders on the ground and with the iraqi government
there will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments
but our enemies should be left with no doubt
this plan gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to support our iraqi partners, and to succeed
after we remove our combat brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the iraqi government and its security forces as they take the absolute lead in securing their country
as i have long said, we will retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions
training, equipping, and advising iraqi security forces as long as they remain non-sectarian
conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions
and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within iraq
initially, this force will likely be made up of 35-50,000 u
troops
through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments
and under the status of forces agreement with the iraqi government, i intend to remove all u
troops from iraq by the end of 2011
we will complete this transition to iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honor that they have earned
as we responsibly remove our combat brigades, we will pursue the second part of our strategy
sustained diplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous iraq
the drawdown of our military should send a clear signal that iraq's future is now its own responsibility
the long-term success of the iraqi nation will depend upon decisions made by iraq's leaders and the fortitude of the iraqi people
iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions
america cannot – and should not – take their place
however, a strong political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance progress and help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security
this effort will be led by our new ambassador to iraq – chris hill
from his time in the peace corps, to his work in kosovo and korea, ambassador hill has been tested, and he has shown the pragmatism and skill that we need right now
he will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many american diplomats and aid workers who are serving in iraq
going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts
we will work with the united nations to support national elections, while helping iraqis improve local government
we can serve as an honest broker in pursuit of fair and durable agreements on issues that have divided iraq's leaders
and just as we will support iraq's security forces, we will help iraqi institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law, confront corruption, and deliver basic services
diplomacy and assistance is also required to help the millions of displaced iraqis
these men, women and children are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to stability in the region, and they must become a part of iraq's reconciliation and recovery
america has a strategic interest – and a moral responsibility – to act
in the coming months, my administration will provide more assistance and take steps to increase international support for countries already hosting refugees
we'll cooperate with others to resettle iraqis facing great personal risk
and we will work with the iraqi government over time to resettle refugees and displaced iraqis within iraq – because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peace than displaced citizens returning home
now, before i go any further, i want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of iraq
you are a great nation, rooted in the cradle of civilization
you are joined together by enduring accomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as the two rivers carved into your land
in years past, you have persevered through tyranny and terror
through personal insecurity and sectarian violence
and instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you stepped back from a descent into civil war, and showed a proud resilience that deserves respect
our nations have known difficult times together
but ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, and countless friendships among our people
we americans have offered our most precious resource   our young men and women   to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism
to root out our common enemies
and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, and for yours
there are those who will try to prevent that future for iraq – who will insist that iraq's differences cannot be reconciled without more killing
they represent the forces that destroy nations and lead only to despair, and they will test our will in the months and years to come
america, too, has known these forces
we endured the pain of civil war, and bitter divisions of region and race
but hostility and hatred are no match for justice
they offer no pathway to peace
and they must not stand between the people of iraq and a future of reconciliation and hope
so to the iraqi people, let me be clear about america's intentions
the united states pursues no claim on your territory or your resources
we respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have made for your country
we seek a full transition to iraqi responsibility for the security of your country
and going forward, we can build a lasting relationship founded upon mutual interests and mutual respect as iraq takes its rightful place in the community of nations
that leads me to the third part of our strategy   comprehensive american engagement across the region
the future of iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader middle east, so we must work with our friends and partners to establish a new framework that advances iraq's security and the region's
it is time for iraq to be a full partner in a regional dialogue, and for iraq's neighbors to establish productive and normalized relations with iraq
and going forward, the united states will pursue principled and sustained engagement with all of the nations in the region, and that will include iran and syria
this reflects a fundamental truth
we can no longer deal with regional challenges in isolation – we need a smarter, more sustainable and comprehensive approach
that is why we are renewing our diplomacy, while relieving the burden on our military
that is why we are refocusing on al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
developing a strategy to use all elements of american power to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon
and actively seeking a lasting peace between israel and the arab world
and that is why we have named three of america's most accomplished diplomats – george mitchell, dennis ross and richard holbrooke – to support secretary clinton and me as we carry forward this agenda
every nation and every group must know   whether you wish america good or ill   that the end of the war in iraq will enable a new era of american leadership and engagement in the middle east
and that era has just begun
finally, i want to be very clear that my strategy for ending the war in iraq does not end with military plans or diplomatic agendas – it endures through our commitment to uphold our sacred trust with every man and woman who has served in iraq
you make up a fraction of the american population, but in an age when so many people and institutions have acted irresponsibly, you did the opposite – you volunteered to bear the heaviest burden
and for you and for your families, the war does not end when you come home
it lives on in memories of your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who gave their lives
it endures in the wound that is slow to heal, the disability that isn't going away, the dream that wakes you at night, or the stiffening in your spine when a car backfires down the street
you and your families have done your duty – now a grateful nation must do ours
that is why i am increasing the number of soldiers and marines, so that we lessen the burden on those who are serving
and that is why i have committed to expanding our system of veterans health care to serve more patients, and to provide better care in more places
we will continue building new wounded warrior facilities across america, and invest in new ways of identifying and treating the signature wounds of this war
post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, as well as other combat injuries
we also know that service does not end with the person wearing the uniform
in her visits with military families across the country, my wife michelle has learned firsthand about the unique burden that your families endure every day
i want you to know this
military families are a top priority for michelle and me, and they will be a top priority for my administration
we'll raise military pay, and continue providing quality child-care, job-training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have known the separation and stress of war
we will also heed the lesson of history – that those who fight in battle can form the backbone of our middle class – by implementing a 21st century gi bill to help our veterans live their dreams
as a nation, we have had our share of debates about the war in iraq
it has, at times, divided us as a people
to this very day, there are some americans who want to stay in iraq longer, and some who want to leave faster
but there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved
and so i want to be very clear
we sent our troops to iraq to do away with saddam hussein's regime – and you got the job done
we kept our troops in iraq to help establish a sovereign government – and you got the job done
and we will leave the iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life – that is your achievement
that is the prospect that you have made possible
there are many lessons to be learned from what we've experienced
we have learned that america must go to war with clearly defined goals, which is why i've ordered a review of our policy in afghanistan
we have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the american people, which is why i've put iraq and afghanistan into my budget
we have learned that in the 21st century, we must use all elements of american power to achieve our objectives, which is why i am committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on to our military
we have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that our national security policies depend upon, which is why i will consult with congress and in carrying out my plans
and we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are launching a new era of engagement in the world
the starting point for our policies must always be the safety of the american people
i know that you – the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world – can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe
and as long as i am your commander-in-chief, i promise you that i will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the job done
that is the most important lesson of all – for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable
you know because you have seen those sacrifices
you have lived them
and we all honor them
semper fidelis – it means always being faithful to corps, and to country, and to the memory of fallen comrades like corporal jonathan yale and lance corporal jordan haerter
these young men enlisted in a time of war, knowing they would face great danger
they came here, to camp lejeune, as they trained for their mission
and last april, they were standing guard in anbar
in an age when suicide is a weapon, they were suddenly faced with an oncoming truck filled with explosives
these two marines stood their ground
these two marines opened fire
and these two marines stopped that truck
when the thousands of pounds of explosives detonated, they had saved fifty marines and iraqi police who would have been in the truck's path, but corporal yale and lance corporal haerter lost their own lives
jonathan was 21
jordan was 19
in the town where jordan haerter was from, a bridge was dedicated in his name
one marine who traveled to the ceremony said
we flew here from all over the country to pay tribute to our friend jordan, who risked his life to save us
we wouldn't be here without him
america's time in iraq is filled with stories of men and women like this
their names are written into bridges and town squares
they are etched into stones at arlington, and in quiet places of rest across our land
they are spoken in schools and on city blocks
they live on in the memories of those who wear your uniform, in the hearts of those they loved, and in the freedom of the nation they served
each american who has served in iraq has their own story
each of you has your own story
and that story is now a part of the history of the united states of america – a nation that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from the beaches of normandy to the deserts of anbar
from the mountains of korea to the streets of kandahar
you teach us that the price of freedom is great
your sacrifice should challenge all of us – every single american – to ask what we can do to be better citizens
there will be more danger in the months ahead
we will face new tests and unforeseen trials
but thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we are leaving iraq to its people, and we have begun the work of ending this war
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america
semper fi
madame speaker, mr
vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states (who is around here somewhere)
i have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here
i know that for many americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others
and rightly so
if you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has   a friend
a neighbor
a member of your family
you don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day
it's the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights
it's the job you thought you'd retire from but now have lost
the business you built your dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread
the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope
the impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere
but while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken
though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight i want every american to know this
we will rebuild, we will recover, and the united states of america will emerge stronger than before
the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation
the answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach
they exist in our laboratories and universities
in our fields and our factories
in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on earth
those qualities that have made america the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure
what is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more
now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities   as a government or as a people
i say this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament
the fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight
nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank
we have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy
yet we import more oil today than ever before
the cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform
our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for
and though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before
in other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity
where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election
a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future
regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market
people bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway
and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day
well that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here
now is the time to act boldly and wisely   to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity
now is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down
that is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that's what i'd like to talk to you about tonight
it's an agenda that begins with jobs
as soon as i took office, i asked this congress to send me a recovery plan by president's day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets
not because i believe in bigger government – i don't
not because i'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited – i am
i called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships
in fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years
that's why i pushed for quick action
and tonight, i am grateful that this congress delivered, and pleased to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act is now law
over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3
5 million jobs
more than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector – jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges
constructing wind turbines and solar panels
laying broadband and expanding mass transit
because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids
health care professionals can continue caring for our sick
there are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make
because of this plan, 95% of the working households in america will receive a tax cut   a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on april 1st
because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college
and americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm
i know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work
i understand that skepticism
here in washington, we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending
and with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right
that is why i have asked vice president biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort – because nobody messes with joe
i have told each member of my cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the american people for every dollar they spend
i have appointed a proven and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud
and we have created a new website called recovery
gov so that every american can find out how and where their money is being spent
so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track
but it is just the first step
because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system
i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every american should know that it directly affects you and your family's well-being
you should also know that the money you've deposited in banks across the country is safe
your insurance is secure
and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system
that is not the source of concern
the concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins
you see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy
the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education
how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll
but credit has stopped flowing the way it should
too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks
with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or to each other
when there is no lending, families can't afford to buy homes or cars
so businesses are forced to make layoffs
our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further
that is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending
we will do so in several ways
first, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running
second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their mortgages
it's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of americans who are struggling with declining home values – americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about
in fact, the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage
third, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times
and when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy
i understand that on any given day, wall street may be more comforted by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions
but such an approach won't solve the problem
and our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start lending to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all
i intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the american taxpayer
this time, ceos won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet
those days are over
still, this plan will require significant resources from the federal government – and yes, probably more than we've already set aside
but while the cost of action will be great, i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade
that would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation
and i refuse to let that happen
i understand that when the last administration asked this congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, democrats and republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed
so were the american taxpayers
so was i
so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions
i promise you – i get it
but i also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment
my job – our job – is to solve the problem
our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility
i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single wall street executive, but i will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage
that's what this is about
it's not about helping banks – it's about helping people
because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home
and then some company will hire workers to build it
and then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they'll finally buy that car, or open their own business
investors will return to the market, and american families will see their retirement secured once more
slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover
so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary
because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession
and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system
it is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse
the recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we're taking to revive our economy in the short-term
but the only way to fully restore america's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world
the only way this century will be another american century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care
the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit
that is our responsibility
in the next few days, i will submit a budget to congress
so often, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs
i see this document differently
i see it as a vision for america – as a blueprint for our future
my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue
it reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited – a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession
given these realities, everyone in this chamber – democrats and republicans – will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars
and that includes me
but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges
i reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves
that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity
for history tells a different story
history reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas
in the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry
from the turmoil of the industrial revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age
in the wake of war and depression, the gi bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history
and a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an american on the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world
in each case, government didn't supplant private enterprise
it catalyzed private enterprise
it created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive
we are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal
now we must be that nation again
that is why, even as it cuts back on the programs we don't need, the budget i submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future
energy, health care, and education
it begins with energy
we know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century
and yet, it is china that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient
we invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like germany and japan in producing it
new plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in korea
well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders – and i know you don't either
it is time for america to lead again
thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years
we have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in american history – an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and technology
we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country
and we will put americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills
but to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy
so i ask this congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in america
and to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power
advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in america
as for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink
we should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices
but we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win
millions of jobs depend on it
scores of communities depend on it
and i believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it
none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy
but this is america
we don't do what's easy
we do what is necessary to move this country forward
for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care
this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every thirty seconds
by the end of the year, it could cause 1
5 million americans to lose their homes
in the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages
and in each of these years, one million more americans have lost their health insurance
it is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas
and it's one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget
given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold
already, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade
when it was days old, this congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million american children whose parents work full-time
our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives
it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every american by seeking a cure for cancer in our time
and it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control
this budget builds on these reforms
it includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform – a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every american
it's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue
and it's a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come
now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why i'm bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next week
i suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process
it will be hard
but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough
so let there be no doubt
health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year
the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america
in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity – it is a pre-requisite
right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma
and yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education
we have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation
and half of the students who begin college never finish
this is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow
that is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education – from the day they are born to the day they begin a career
already, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan
we have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life
we have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students
and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's progress
but we know that our schools don't just need more resources
they need more reform
that is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance
pathways for advancement, and rewards for success
we'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps
and we will expand our commitment to charter schools
it is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work
but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it
and so tonight, i ask every american to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training
this can be community college or a four-year school
vocational training or an apprenticeship
but whatever the training may be, every american will need to get more than a high school diploma
and dropping out of high school is no longer an option
it's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country – and this country needs and values the talents of every american
that is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal
by 2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world
i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education
and to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, i ask this congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of senator orrin hatch as well as an american who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country – senator edward kennedy
these education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children
but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them
in the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the tv, put away the video games, and read to their child
i speak to you not just as a president, but as a father when i say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home
there is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children
and that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay
with the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down
i'm proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and i want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities
yesterday, i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office
my administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs
as you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time
but we're starting with the biggest lines
we have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade
in this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them
we'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don't use
we will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas
in order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of americans
but let me perfectly clear, because i know you'll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people
if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime
i repeat
not one single dime
in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut – that's right, a tax cut – for 95% of working families
and these checks are on the way
to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in medicare and social security
comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen medicare for years to come
and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all americans
finally, because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust, i am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget
that is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules – and for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and afghanistan
for seven years, we have been a nation at war
no longer will we hide its price
we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war
and with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaeda and combat extremism
because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the american people from safe havens half a world away
as we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy
to each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, americans are united in sending one message
we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support
to relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines
and to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned
to overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend – because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of america
that is why i have ordered the closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists – because living our values doesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger
and that is why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the united states of america does not torture
in words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun
for we know that america cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without america
we cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm
we are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand
to seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort
to meet the challenges of the 21st century – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation
from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty – we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power
and to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the g-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for american goods in markets across the globe
for the world depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world's
as we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us – watching to see what we do with this moment
waiting for us to lead
those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times
it is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege – one that has been entrusted to few generations of americans
for in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill
i know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth – to become cynical and doubtful
consumed with the petty and the trivial
but in my life, i have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places
that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of americans who are anything but ordinary
i think about leonard abess, the bank president from miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him
he didn't tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, ''i knew some of these people since i was 7 years old
i didn't feel right getting the money myself
i think about greensburg, kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community – how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay
the tragedy was terrible, said one of the men who helped them rebuild
but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity
and i think about ty'sheoma bethea, the young girl from that school i visited in dillon, south carolina – a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom
she has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room
she even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp
the letter asks us for help, and says, we are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world
we are not quitters
we are not quitters
these words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here
they tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres
a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity
their resolve must be our inspiration
their concerns must be our cause
and we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us
i know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways
but i also know that every american who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed
that must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done
that is the foundation on which the american people expect us to build common ground
and if we do – if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis
if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity
if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an america that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, something worthy to be remembered
thank you, god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america
thank you
pease, be seated
thank you, very much
madam speaker, leader reid, members of congress, dear friends, former colleagues
it is a great honor to be here   a place where lincoln served, was inaugurated, and where the nation he saved bid him a last farewell
as we mark the bicentennial of our 16th president's birth, i cannot claim to know as much about his life and works as many who are also speaking today, but i can say that i feel a special gratitude to this singular figure who in so many ways made my own story possible   and in so many ways made america's story possible
it is fitting that we are holding this celebration here at the capitol, for the life of this building is bound ever so closely to the times of this immortal president
built by artisans and craftsmen, but also immigrants and slaves, it was here, in the rotunda, that union soldiers received help from a makeshift hospital
it was downstairs, in the basement, that they were baked bread to give them strength
and it was in the senate and house chambers where they slept at night and spent some of their days
what those soldiers saw when they looked on this building was a very different sight than the one we see today, for it remained unfinished until the end of the war
the laborers who built the dome came to work wondering each day whether that would be their last
whether the metal they were using for its frame would be requisitioned for the war and melted down into bullets
but each day went by without any orders to halt construction, and so they kept on working, and kept on building
and when president lincoln was finally told of all the metal being used here, his response was short and clear
that is as it should be
the american people needed to be reminded, he believed, that even in a time of war, the work would go on
the people's business would continue
that even when the nation itself was in doubt, its future was being secured
and that on that distant day, when the guns fell silent, a national capitol would stand, with a statue of freedom at its peak, as a symbol of unity in a land still mending its divisions
it is this sense of unity, this ability to plan for a shared future even at a moment where our nation was torn apart, that i reflect on today
and while there are any number of moments that reveal that particular side of this extraordinary man, abraham lincoln   that particular aspect of his leadership   there's one that i'd like to share with you today
in the war's final weeks, aboard grant's flagship, the river queen, president lincoln was asked what was to be done with the rebel armies once general lee surrendered
with victory at hand, lincoln could have sought revenge
he could have forced the south to pay a steep price for their rebellion
but despite all the bloodshed and all the misery that each side had exacted upon the other, and despite his absolute certainty in the rightness of the cause of ending slavery, no confederate soldier was to be punished, lincoln ordered
they were to be treated, as he put it, liberally all round
what lincoln wanted was for confederate troops to go back home and return to work on their farms and in their shops
he was even willing, he said, to let them have their horses to plow and their guns to shoot crows with
that was the only way, lincoln knew, to repair the rifts that had torn this country apart
it was the only way to begin the healing that our nation so desperately needed
what lincoln never forgot, not even in the midst of civil war, was that despite all that divides us   north and south, black and white   we were, at heart, one nation and one people, sharing a bond as americans that could bend but would not break
and so even as we meet here today, in a moment when we are far less divided than in lincoln's day, but when we are once again debating the critical issues of our time   and debating them sometimes fiercely   let us remember that we are doing so as servants of the same flag, as representatives of the same people, and as stakeholders in a common future
that is the most fitting tribute we can pay   the most lasting monument we can build   to that most remarkable of men, abraham lincoln
thank you
thank you, tim, for your hard work on this issue and on our economic recovery
the economic crisis we face is unlike any we've seen in our lifetime
it's a crisis of falling confidence and rising debt, of widely distributed risk and narrowly concentrated reward
a crisis written in the fine print of sub-prime mortgages, on the ledger lines of once mighty financial institutions, and on the pink slips that have upended the lives of so many people across this country and cost the economy 2
6 million jobs last year alone
we know that even if we do everything that we should, this crisis was years in the making, and it will take more than weeks or months to turn things around
but make no mistake
a failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee a longer recession, a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future
millions more jobs will be lost
more businesses will be shuttered
more dreams will be deferred
and that's why i feel such a sense of urgency about the economic recovery and reinvestment plan that is before congress today
with it, we can save or create more than three million jobs, doing things that will strengthen our country for years to come
it's not merely a prescription for short-term spending   it's a strategy for long-term economic growth in areas like renewable energy and health care and education
now, in the past few days i've heard criticisms that this plan is somehow wanting, and these criticisms echo the very same failed economic theories that led us into this crisis in the first place   the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems
that we can ignore fundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care
that we can somehow deal with this in a piecemeal fashion and still expect our economy and our country to thrive
i reject those theories
and so did the american people when they went to the polls in november and voted resoundingly for change
so i urge members of congress to act without delay
no plan is perfect, and we should work to make it stronger
no one is more committed to making it stronger than me
but let's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential
let's show people all over the country who are looking for leadership in this difficult time that we are equal to the task
at the same time, we know that this recovery and reinvestment plan is only the first part of what we need to do to restore prosperity and secure our future
we also need a strong and viable financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses and families alike
and my administration will do whatever it takes to restore our financial system
our recovery depends on it
and so in the next week, secretary geithner will release a new strategy to get credit moving again   a strategy that will reflect some of the lessons of past mistakes while laying the foundation of the future
but in order to restore trust in our financial system, we're going to have to do more than just put forward our plans
in order to restore trust, we've got to make certain that taxpayer funds are not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on wall street
we all need to take responsibility
and this includes executives at major financial firms who turned to the american people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paid themselves customary lavish bonuses
as i said last week, this is the height of irresponsibility
it's shameful
and that's exactly the kind of disregard of the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis
a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain at the expense of everything else
this is america
we don't disparage wealth
we don't begrudge anybody for achieving success
and we certainly believe that success should be rewarded
but what gets people upset   and rightfully so   are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when those rewards are subsidized by u
taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough time themselves
for top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis isn't just bad taste   it's bad strategy   and i will not tolerate it as president
we're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid   so that when firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks
as part of the reforms we're announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinary help from u
taxpayers will have their compensation capped at 500,000 dollars   a fraction of the salaries that have been reported recently
and if these executives receive any additional compensation, it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paid back for their assistance
companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks and luxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and to shareholders as to why these expenses are justified
and we're putting a stop to these kinds of massive severance packages we've all read about with disgust
we're taking the air out of golden parachutes
we're asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and their role in it
we believe that what we've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basic common sense
and finally, these guidelines we're putting in place are only the beginning of a long-term effort
we're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and a quarter-by-quarter mentality that in turn helped to wrought havoc in our financial system
we're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management, and rewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks
we all have to pull together and take our share of responsibility
that's true here in washington
that's true on wall street
the american people are carrying a huge burden as a result of this economic crisis
bearing the brunt of its effects as well as the cost of extraordinary measures we're taking to address them
the american people expect and demand that we pursue policies that reflect the reality of this crisis   and that will prevent these kinds of crises from occurring again in the future
thank you very much
we begin this year and this administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action
just this week, we saw more people file for unemployment than at any time in the last twenty-six years, and experts agree that if nothing is done, the unemployment rate could reach double digits
our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four
and we could lose a generation of potential, as more young americans are forced to forgo college dreams or the chance to train for the jobs of the future
in short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse
that is why i have proposed an american recovery and reinvestment plan to immediately jumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth
i am pleased to say that both parties in congress are already hard at work on this plan, and i hope to sign it into law in less than a month
it's a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs over the next few years, and one that recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment   the fact that there are millions of americans trying to find work even as, all around the country, there's so much work to be done
that's why this is not just a short-term program to boost employment
it's one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education
health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century
today i'd like to talk specifically about the progress we expect to make in each of these areas
to accelerate the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double our capacity to generate alternative sources of energy like wind, solar, and biofuels over the next three years
we'll begin to build a new electricity grid that lay down more than 3,000 miles of transmission lines to convey this new energy from coast to coast
we'll save taxpayers $2 billion a year by making 75% of federal buildings more energy efficient, and save the average working family $350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2
5 million homes
to lower health care cost, cut medical errors, and improve care, we'll computerize the nation's health record in five years, saving billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives
and we'll protect health insurance for more than 8 million americans who are in danger of losing their coverage during this economic downturn
to ensure our children can compete and succeed in this new economy, we'll renovate and modernize 10,000 schools, building state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries, and labs to improve learning for over five million students
we'll invest more in pell grants to make college affordable for seven million more students, provide a $2,500 college tax credit to four million students, and triple the number of fellowships in science to help spur the next generation of innovation
finally, we will rebuild and retrofit america to meet the demands of the 21st century
that means repairing and modernizing thousands of miles of america's roadways and providing new mass transit options for millions of americans
it means protecting america by securing 90 major ports and creating a better communications network for local law enforcement and public safety officials in the event of an emergency
and it means expanding broadband access to millions of americans, so business can compete on a level-playing field, wherever they're located
i know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan
i understand that skepticism, which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedented measures that will allow the american people to hold my administration accountable for these results
we won't just throw money at our problems   we'll invest in what works
instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible
we'll launch an unprecedented effort to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending in our government, and every american will be able to see how and where we spend taxpayer dollars by going to a new website called recovery
gov
no one policy or program will solve the challenges we face right now, nor will this crisis recede in a short period of time
but if we act now and act boldly
if we start rewarding hard work and responsibility once more
if we act as citizens and not partisans and begin again the work of remaking america, then i have faith that we will emerge from this trying time even stronger and more prosperous than we were before
thanks for listening
my fellow citizens
i stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors
i thank president bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition
forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath
the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace
yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms
at these moments, america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers , and true to our founding documents
so it has been
so it must be with this generation of americans
that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood
our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred
our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age
homes have been lost
jobs shed
businesses shuttered
our health care is too costly
our schools fail too many
and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet
these are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics
less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land   a nagging fear that america's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights
today i say to you that the challenges we face are real
they are serious and they are many
they will not be met easily or in a short span of time
but know this, america
they will be met
on this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord
on this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics
we remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things
2 the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit
to choose our better history
to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation
the god-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness
in reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given
it must be earned
our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less
it has not been the path for the faint-hearted   for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame
rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things   some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom
for us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life
for us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west
endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth
for us, they fought and died, in places like concord and gettysburg
normandy and khe sahn
time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life
they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions
greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction
this is the journey we continue today
we remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on earth
our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began
our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year
our capacity remains undiminished
but our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed
starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking america
for everywhere we look, there is work to be done
the state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act   not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth
we will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together
we will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost
we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories
and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age
all this we can do
all this we will do
now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions   who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans
their memories are short
for they have forgotten what this country has already done
what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage
what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them   that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply
the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works   whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified
where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward
where the answer is no, programs will end
and those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account   to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day   because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government
nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill
its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control
the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous
the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity
on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart   not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good
as for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals
our founding fathers   our founding fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations
those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience' sake
and so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born
know that america is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity
and we are ready to lead once more
recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions
they understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please
instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use
our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint
we are the keepers of this legacy
guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort   even greater cooperation and understanding between nations
we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan
with old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet
we will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken
you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you
for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness
we are a nation of christians and muslims, jews and hindus   and non-believers
we are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth
and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass
that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve
that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself
and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace
to the muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect
to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west   know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy
to those   to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history
but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist
to the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow
to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds
and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders
nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect
for the world has changed, and we must change with it
as we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains
they have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages
we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service
a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves
and yet, at this moment   a moment that will define a generation   it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all
for as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies
it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours
it is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate
our challenges may be new
the instruments with which we meet them may be new
but those values upon which our success depends   honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism   these things are old
these things are true
they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history
what is demanded then is a return to these truths
what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility   a recognition, on the part of every american, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task
this is the price and the promise of citizenship
this is the source of our confidence   the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny
this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed   why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath
so let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled
in the year of america's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river
the capitol was abandoned
the enemy was advancing
the snow was stained with blood
at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people
let it be told to the future world
that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive
that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet
america
in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words
with hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come
let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter
and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america
hello america
i want to thank all the speakers and performers today for reminding us, through song and through words, just what it is that we love about america
i want to thank all of you for braving the cold and the crowds and traveling in some cases thousands of miles to join us here today
welcome to washington, and welcome to this celebration of american renewal
in the course of our history, only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now
our nation is at war
our economy is in crisis
millions of americans are losing their jobs and their homes
they're worried about how they'll afford college for their kids or pay the stack of bills on their kitchen table
and most of all, they're anxious and uncertain about the future   about whether this generation of americans will be able to pass on what's best about this country to our children and their children
i won't pretend that meeting any one of these challenges will be easy
it will take more than a month or a year, and it will likely take many
along the way there will be setbacks and false starts and days that test our resolve as a nation
but despite all this   despite the enormity of the task that lies ahead   i stand here today as hopeful as ever that the united states of america will endure, that it will prevail, that the dream of our founders will live on in our time
what gives me hope is what i see when i look out across this mall
for in these monuments are chiseled those unlikely stories that affirm our unyielding faith   a faith that anything is possible in america
rising before us stands a memorial to a man who led a small band of farmers and shopkeepers in revolution against the army of an empire, all for the sake of an idea
on the ground below is a tribute to a generation that withstood war and depression   men and women like my grandparents who toiled on bomber assembly lines and marched across europe to free the world from tyranny's grasp
directly in front of us is a pool that still reflects the dream of a king, and the glory of a people who marched and bled so that their children might be judged by their character's content
and behind me, watching over the union he saved, sits the man who in so many ways made this day possible
and yet, as i stand here today, what gives me the greatest hope of all is not the stone and marble that surrounds us, but what   what fills the spaces in between
it is you   americans of every race and region and station who came here because you believe in what this country can be and because you want to help us get there
it's the same thing that gave me hope from the day we began this campaign for the presidency nearly two years ago
a belief that if we could just recognize ourselves in one another and bring everyone together   democrats, republicans, independents
latino, asian and native american
black and white, gay and straight, disabled and not   then not only would we restore hope and opportunity in places that yearned for both, but maybe, just maybe, we might perfect our union in the process
this is what i believed, but you made this belief real
you proved once more that people who love this country can change it
and as i prepare to assume the presidency, yours are the voices i will take with me every day when i walk into that oval office   the voices of men and women who have different stories but hold common hopes
who ask only for what was promised us as americans   that we might make of our lives what we will and see our children climb higher than we did
it is this thread that binds us together in common effort
that runs through every memorial on this mall
that connects us to all those who struggled and sacrificed and stood here before
it is how this nation has overcome the greatest differences and the longest odds   because there is no obstacle that can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change
that is the belief with which we began this campaign, and that is how we will overcome what ails us now
there is no doubt that our road will be long, that our climb will be steep
but never forget that the true character of our nation is revealed not during times of comfort and ease, but by the right we do when the moment is hard
i ask you to help reveal that character once more, and together, we can carry forward as one nation, and one people, the legacy of our forefathers that we celebrate today
thank you, america
god bless you
let me begin by thanking george mason university for their extraordinary hospitality and to thank all the great friends, the governors, the mayors who are in attendance here today
throughout america's history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare
and then there are the years that come along once in a generation, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course for our nation
this is one of those years
we start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks
nearly two million jobs have been now lost
and on friday, we're likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since world war ii
just in the past year, another 2
8 million americans who want and need full-time work have had to settle for part-time jobs
manufacturing has hit a 28-year low
many businesses cannot borrow or make payroll
many families cannot pay their bills or their mortgage
many workers are watching their life savings disappear
and many, many americans are both anxious and uncertain of what the future will hold
now, i don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible
if nothing is done, this recession could linger for years
the unemployment rate could reach double digits
our economy could fall 1 trillion dollars short of its full capacity, which translates into more than 12,000 dollars in lost income for a family of four
we could lose a generation of potential and promise as more young americans are forced to forego dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future
and our nation could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing in the world
in short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse
this crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the business cycle
and we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on the worn-out dogmas of the past
we arrived at this point due to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from corporate board rooms to the halls of power in washington, d
for years, too many wall street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seeking profits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability
banks made loans without concern for whether borrowers could repay them, and some borrowers took advantage of cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford
politicians spent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring political points instead of problems they were sent here to solve
the result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our economy, our financial markets, and our government
now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond our ability to solve
our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future greatness
it will take time   perhaps many years   but we can rebuild that lost trust and confidence
we can restore opportunity and prosperity
we should never forget that our workers are still more productive than any on earth
our universities are still the envy of the world
we are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and the most advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known
and we are still the nation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds
if we act with the urgency and seriousness that this moment requires, i know that we can do it again
that is why i have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an american recovery and reinvestment plan that will immediately jump-start job creation and long-term growth
it's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges
for if we hope to end this crisis, we must end the culture of anything goes that helped create it, and this change must begin in washington
it's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility
it's time to finally change the ways of washington so that we can set a new and better course for america
there is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable
it will certainly add to the budget deficit in the short term
but equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence in our economy
it is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth
but at this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost necessary to lift us from a recession this deep and severe
only government can break the cycle that are  crippling our economy, where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs, which leads to even less spending, where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit
that's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles
that's why we need to put money in the pockets of the american people, create new jobs, and invest in our future
that's why we need to restart the flow of credit and restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like this never happens again
now this plan begins with   this plan must begin today, a plan i am confident will save or create at least three million jobs over the next few years
it's not just another public works program
it's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and promise of this moment
the fact that there are millions of americans trying to find work, even as all around the country there's so much work to be done
and that's why we'll invest in priorities like energy and education, health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century
that's why the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in the private sector, while our plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and others who provide vital services
to finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production of alternative energy in the next three years
we will modernize more than 75 percent of federal buildings and improve the energy efficiency of 2 million american homes, saving consumers and taxpayers billions on our energy bills
in the process, we will put americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced, jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, constructing fuel-efficient cars and buildings, and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs, more savings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain
to improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that, within five years, all of america's medical records are computerized
this will cut waste, eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensive medical tests
but it just won't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs
it will save lives by reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system
to give our children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been more competitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and public universities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries
we'll provide new computers, new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in chicago and boston can compete with children in beijing for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future
to build an economy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild america
yes, we'll put people to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy, and needed infrastructure projects
but we'll also do more to retrofit america for a global economy
that means updating the way we get our electricity by starting to build a new smart grid that will save us money, protect our power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation
it means expanding broadband lines across america, so that a small business in a rural town can connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world
it means investing in the science, research, and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new industries
and finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states, workers, and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession
to get people spending again, 95% of working families will receive a thousand dollar tax cut   the first stage of a middle-class tax cut that i promised during the campaign and will include in our next budget
to help americans who have lost their jobs and can't find new ones, we'll continue the bipartisan extension of unemployment insurance and health care coverage to help them through this crisis
government at every level will have to tighten its belt, but we'll help struggling states avoid harmful budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use the money to maintain essential services like police, fire, education, and health care
now i understand that some might be skeptical of this plan
our government has already spent a good deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higher incomes or renewed confidence in our economy
and that's why the american recovery and reinvestment plan won't just throw money at our problems
we'll invest in what works
the true test of policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're democratic or republican ideas, whether they're conservative or liberal ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow our economy, and put the american dream within the reach of the american people
instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible
every american will be able to hold washington accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their taxpayer dollars are being spent
and as i announced yesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessary spending that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and our children's future than it is right now
we have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economy recovers, the deficits start coming down
we cannot have a solid recovery if our people and our businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in order
and that's why our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, but a foundation for long-term economic growth
that also means an economic recovery plan that is free from earmarks and pet projects
i understand that every member of congress has ideas about how to spend money
many of these projects are worthy
they benefit local communities
but this emergency legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations
this must be a time when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own narrow interests
now, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis
we must also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system we all depend on
that means using our full arsenal of tools to get credit flowing again to families and businesses, while restoring confidence in our markets
it means launching a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure crisis so that we can keep responsible families in their homes
it means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse could endanger the entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clear understanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action that must come with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support
and it means reforming a weak and outdated regulatory system so that we can better withstand financial shocks and better protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the reckless greed and risk-taking that must never endanger our prosperity again
no longer can we allow wall street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks
no longer can we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales
no longer can we allow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to destructive cycles of bubble and bust
it is time to set a new course for this economy, and that change must begin now
we should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but i urge congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the american people
for every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more americans will lose their jobs
more families will lose their savings
more dreams will be deferred and denied
and our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse
that is not the country i know
it is not a future i accept as president of the united states
a world that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and waiting for america to lead once more
and that is what we will do
it will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worse before they get better
but that is all the more reason for congress to act without delay
i know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation
we have already tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach that helped lead us to this day of reckoning
and that is why the time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work and responsibility are once again rewarded
that's why i'm asking congress to work with me and my team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next few weeks
that's why i'm calling on all americans   democrats and republicans and independents   to put   to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles
a sense of common purpose above the same narrow partisanship
and insist that the first question each of us asks isn't, what's good for me
but what's good for the country my children will inherit
more than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront these challenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down war, and depression, and fear itself
and if we do, if we are able to summon that spirit again, if we are able to look out for one another, and listen to one another, and do our part for our nation and for posterity, then i have no doubt that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one of those years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for the united states of america
thank you, god bless you, and may god bless america
morning, everybody
last week, vice president-elect biden and i began the process of announcing our economic team
today, we are pleased to name another key member of this team
our nominee for secretary of commerce, my great friend, governor bill richardson
with each passing day, the work our team has begun, developing plans to revive our economy, becomes more urgent
earlier this week, we learned that the u
economy has been in recession since december of 2007 and that our manufacturing output is at a 26 year low   two stark reminders of the magnitude of the challenges we face
but while i know rebuilding our economy won't be easy   and it won't be   happen overnight   i also know this
that right now, somewhere in america, a small business is at work with the next big idea
a scientist is on the cusp of the next big breakthrough discovery
an entrepreneur is sketching plans for the startup that will revolutionize an industry
right now, across america, the finest products in the world are rolling off our assembly lines
and the proudest, most determined, most productive workers in the world are on the job   some, already on their second shift of the day
many, putting in longer hours than ever before
after nearly two years of traveling across this country, meeting with workers, visiting businesses large and small, i am more confident than ever that we have everything we need to renew our economy
we've got the ingenuity, the technology, the skill, and commitment
we just need to put it to work
it's time to not just address the immediate economic threats, but to start laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity to help american businesses grow and thrive at home, and expand our efforts to promote american enterprise around the world
this work is the core mission of the secretary of commerce
and with his breadth and depth of experience in public life, governor richardson is uniquely suited for this role as a leading economic diplomat for america
during his time in state government and congress, and in tour   two tours of duty in the cabinet, bill has seen from just about every angle what makes our economy work and what keeps it from working better
as governor of new mexico, bill showed how government can act as a partner to support our businesses, helping to create 80,000 new jobs
and under his leadership, new mexico saw the lowest unemployment rate in decades
as a former secretary of energy, bill understands the steps we must take to build a new, clean-energy industry and create the green jobs of the twenty-first century    jobs that pay well and won't be outsourced
jobs that will help us end our dependence on foreign oil
and as a former ambassador to the united nations, bill brings both international stature and a deep understanding of today's global economy
he understands that the success of today's business in detroit or columbus often depends on whether it can sell products in places like santiago or shanghai
and he knows that america's reputation in the world is critical not just to our security, but to our prosperity   (excuse me)   that when the citizens of the world respect america's leadership, they are more likely to buy america's products
to this crucial work of restoring america's international standing, bill will bring a leadership style all his own
bill has never been content to just learn from briefing books, never satisfied with only the official version of the story
during his time in congress, he held more than two   2,500 town-hall meetings, so he could hear directly from constituents
he was a regular in the u
cafeteria, mixing it up with u
employees over lunch
and during his 2002 campaign for record   for governor, he actually broke a world record by shaking nearly 14,000 hands in just eight hours
(i've got to check that statistic
all of this reflects a determination to reach out and understand where people are coming from, what they hope for, and what he can do to help
this approach, i believe, has been the key to bill's success as a negotiator and will be key to his work on the critical functions of the commerce department   from administering our census and monitoring our climate to protecting our intellectual property and restoring our economic diplomacy
in the end, bill richardson is a leader who shares my values, and he must   and he will be measured his progress the same way i do
are we creating good jobs instead of losing them
are incomes growing instead of shrinking
i know bill will be an unyielding advocate for american business and american jobs at home and around the world
and i look forward to working with him in the years ahead
good morning, everybody
i hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving
last week, we announced our economic team, which is working as we speak to craft an economic recovery program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy
today, vice president-elect biden and i are pleased to announce our national security team
the national security challenges we face are just as grave   and just as urgent   as our economic crisis
we are fighting two wars
our old conflicts remain unresolved, and newly assertive powers have put strains on the international system
the spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril that the world's deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands
our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet
america must also be strong at home to be strong abroad
we need to provide education and opportunity to all our citizens, so every american can compete with anyone, anywhere
and our economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage, and our global leadership
the common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century, our destiny is shared with the world's
from our markets to our security, from our public health to our climate, we must act with the understanding that, now more than ever, we have a stake in what happens across the globe
and as we learned so painfully on 9/11, terror cannot be contained by borders, nor safety provided by oceans alone
last week, we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of six american among nearly 200 victims in mumbai
in the world we seek, there is no place for those who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism
this weekend, i told prime minister singh of india that americans stand with the people of india in this dark time
and i am confident that india's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear it down
and so, in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning   a new dawn of american leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize the opportunities embedded in those challenges
we will strengthen our capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends
we will renew old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships
we will show the world once more that america is relentless in the defense of our people, steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world
democracy and justice
opportunity and unyielding hope   because american values are america's greatest export to the world
to succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates all elements of american power
our military and diplomacy
our intelligence and law enforcement
our economy and the power of our moral example
the team that we've assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that
in their past service and plans for the future, these men and women represent all of those elements of american power, and the very best of the american example
they've served in uniform and as diplomats
they have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, and executives
they share my pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purpose about america's role as a leader in the world
i have known hillary clinton as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and as a campaign opponent
she possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic
i am proud that she will be our next secretary of state
she is an american of tremendous stature who will have my complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who will command respect in every capitol, and who will clearly have the ability to advance our interests around the world
hillary's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew american diplomacy and restore our alliances
there is much to do   from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to iran and north korea, to seeking a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians, to strengthening international institutions
i have no doubt that hillary clinton is the right person to lead our state department, and to work with me in tackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda
at a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars, i've have asked robert gates to continue as secretary of defense, and i'm pleased that he's accepted
two years ago, he took over the pentagon at a difficult time
he restored accountability
he won the confidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform, as well as their families
he earned the respect of members of congress on both sides of the aisle for his pragmatism and competence
he knows that we need a sustainable national security strategy   and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home
as i said throughout the campaign, i will be giving secretary gates and our military a new mission as soon as i take office
responsibly ending the war in iraq through a successful transition to iraqi control
we will also ensure that we have the strategy and resources to succeed against al qaeda and the taliban
as bob said not too long ago, afghanistan is where the war on terror began, and it is where it must end
and going forward, we will continue to make the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces to defeat the threats of the 21st century
eric holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as attorney general from his first day on the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance
he has distinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a senior official, and he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement challenges we face   from terrorism to counter-intelligence, from white collar crime to public corruption
eric also has the combination of toughness and independence that we need at the justice department
let me be clear
the attorney general serves the american people
and i have every expectation that eric will protect our people, uphold the public trust, and adhere to our constitution
janet napolitano offers the experience and executive skills we need in the next secretary of homeland security
she has spent her career protecting people   as a us attorney, an attorney general, and as the governor of arizona
she understands the need for a department of homeland security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks and respond to catastrophe   be it manmade or natural
janet assumes this critical role having learned the lessons   some of them painful   of the last several years, from 9/11 to katrina
she insists on competence and accountability
she knows firsthand the need to have a partner in washington that works well with state and local governments
she understands as well as anyone the danger of an unsecure border
and she will be a leader who can reform a sprawling department while safeguarding our homeland
susan rice will take on the crucial task of serving as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations
susan has been a close and trusted advisor
as in previous administrations, the un ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and an integral member of my team
her background as a scholar, on the national security council, and assistant secretary of state will serve our nation well at the united nations
susan knows that the global challenges we face demand global institutions that work
she shares my belief that the un is an indispensable and imperfect forum
she will carry the message that our commitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform
we need the united nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action   against terror and proliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease
finally, i am convinced that general james jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilled national security advisor
generations of joneses have served heroically on the battlefield   from the beaches of tarawa in world war ii, to foxtrot ridge in vietnam
jim's silver star is a proud part of that legacy
he will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in uniform and as a diplomat
he has commanded a platoon in battle, served as supreme allied commander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of peace in the middle east
jim is focused on the threats of today and the future
he understands the connection between energy and national security, and has worked on the frontlines of global instability – from kosovo to northern iraq to afghanistan
he will advise me and work effectively to integrate our efforts across the government, so that we are effectively using all elements of american power to defeat unconventional threats and promote our values
i am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for american national security
this morning, we met to discuss the situation in mumbai and some of the challenges that we face in the months and years ahead
in the coming weeks, i will be in close contact with these advisors, who will be working with their counterparts in the bush administration to make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on january 20th
given the range of threats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition, i hope that we can proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demand confirmation
we move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men and women protecting us on our front lines
diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerous corners of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours
fbi agents in the field, cops on the beat, prosecutors in our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports
these selfless americans whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of our effort
if we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and promote our values
and as we move forward with respect for america's tradition of a bipartisan national security policy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keeping our nation and our people safe, we are not republicans or democrats
we are americans
there's no monopoly of power or wisdom in either party
together, as one nation, as one people, we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them
together, we will meet the challenges of the 21st century not with fear, but with hope
please be seated
good morning, everybody
yesterday we talked about the need to jump-start our economy
i speak to you today, mindful that we meet at a moment of great challenge for america, as our credit markets are stressed, and our families are struggling
but as difficult as these times are, i'm confident that we're going to rise to meet this challenge   if we're willing to band together and recognize that wall street cannot thrive so long as main street is struggling
if we're willing to summon a new spirit of ingenuity and determination
and if americans of great intellect, broad experience, and good character are willing to serve in our government at its hour of need
yesterday, i announced four such americans to help lead the economic team that will advise me as we seek to climb out of this crisis
today, i'm pleased to announce two other key members of our team
peter orszag as director, and robert nabors as deputy director of the office of management and budget
before i explain why i selected these outstanding public servants, let me say a few words about the work that i'm asking them to undertake
as i said yesterday, the economic crisis we face demands that we invest immediately in a series of measures that will help save or create two and a half million jobs and put tax cuts in the pockets of the hard-pressed middle class
many of those new jobs will come in areas such as energy independence, technology, and health care modernization that will strengthen our economy over the long term
but if we are going to make the investments we need, we also have to be willing to shed the spending that we don't need
in these challenging times, when we're facing both rising deficits and a shrinking economy, budget reform is not an option
it's a necessity
we can't sustain a system that bleeds billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that have outlived their usefulness, or exist solely because of the power of politicians, lobbyists, or interest groups
we simply can't afford it
this isn't about big government or small government
it's about building a smarter government that focuses on what works
that's why i will ask my new team to think anew and act anew to meet our new challenges
we are going to go through our federal budget, as i promised during the campaign   page by page, line by line   eliminating those programs we don't need, and insisting that those that we do need operate in a sensible, cost-effective way
let me just give you one example of what i'm talking about
there's a report today from   that from 2003 to 2006, millionaire farmers received 49 million dollars in crop subsidies even though they were earning more than the 2
5 million cutoff for such subsidies
now, if this is true   and this was just a report this morning   but if it's true, it is a prime example of the kind of waste that i intend to end as president
we're also going to focus on one of the biggest, long-run challenges that our budget faces   namely, the rising cost of health care in both the public and private sectors
this is not just a challenge but also an opportunity to improve the health care that americans rely on and to bring down the costs that taxpayers, businesses, and families have to pay
now, that's what the office of management and budget will do in my administration
it will not only help design a budget and manage its implementation, but it's also going to make sure that our government   your government   is more efficient and more effective at serving the american people
and there is no better person to help lead this effort as director of the omb than my friend peter orszag
peter's been one of our nation's leading voices on budgetary issues
it's said that a nation's budget reflects its values and its priorities
i believe that's true
and i know that peter will bring to his work at the omb a set of priorities that i   and the american people   share
throughout his career, he's made significant contributions in our understanding of all the major economic challenges that we're now confronting   from reducing medical costs to saving social security to fighting global climate change to helping put the dream of a college degree within the reach for more students
as director of the congressional budget office, he reenergized and reinvigorated the agency, while shifting its focus to confront the health care crisis that is not only a cause of so much suffering for so many families, but a rapidly growing portion of our budget and a drag on our entire economy
but it's not simply that peter's past career makes him qualified for this new appointment
it's also that he has a vision for the future that i share
he believes, as i do, that even as we take steps to restore discipline to our budget, we also have to take   take the steps right now that are necessary to solve our immediate crisis
peter doesn't need a map to tell him where the bodies are buried in the federal budget
he knows what works and what doesn't, what's worthy of our precious tax dollars and what is not
just because a program, a special interest tax break, or corporate subsidy is hidden in this year's budget, does not mean that it will survive the next
the old ways of washington simply can't meet the challenges of today and tomorrow
and no one's more able or more qualified to assist peter in this work than deputy director of the omb that i am nominating, robert nabors
rob will bring to this post experience in the executive branch, at the omb, where he helped the clinton administration achieve balanced budgets, as well as in the legislative branch, where he led the appropriations committee staff as a driving force for a responsible budget
together, peter and rob will help steer our budget through congress so that i can sign it into law
now, let me be clear
these appointments, as well as the appointments that i announced yesterday, are not the sum of my economic team
these appointments are going to work closely with those that i have not ye announced   those including the secretaries of energy and labor, commerce, and health and human services, as well as others in my administration   to design a recovery path for both wall street and main street, and to put our economy on a path to long-term growth and prosperity
because at this moment, we must not only restore confidence in our markets
we also must restore the confidence of middle class families that their government is on their side, that it's working for them and on their behalf to meet their families' needs
that's what i intend to do as president of the united states
the news this past week, including this morning's news about citigroup, has made it even more clear that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions
our financial markets are under stress
new home purchases in october were the lowest in half-a-century
recently, more than half-a-million jobless claims were filed, the highest in 18 years
and if we do not act swiftly and boldly, most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year
while we can't underestimate the challenges that we face, we also can't underestimate our capacity to overcome them, to summon that spirit of determination and optimism that has always defined us, and to move forward in a new direction to create new jobs, reform our financial system, and fuel long-term economic growth
we know this won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight
we'll need to bring together the best minds in america to guide us, and that is what i've sought to do in assembling my economic team
i've sought leaders who could offer both sound judgment and fresh thinking, both a depth of experience and a wealth of bold, new ideas, and most of all who share my fundamental belief that we cannot have a thriving wall street without a thriving main street, that in this country we rise or fall as one nation, as one people
today, vice president-elect biden and i are pleased to announce the nomination of four individuals who meet these criteria to lead our economic team
timothy geithner, as secretary of treasury
lawrence summers, as the director of our national economic council
christina romer, as chair of the council of economic advisers
and melody barnes, as director of domestic   the domestic policy council
having served in senior roles at treasury, the imf, and the new york fed, tim geithner offers not just extensive experience shaping economic policy and managing financial markets, he also has an unparalleled understanding of our current economic crisis in all of its depth, complexity, and urgency
tim will waste no time getting up to speed
he will start his first day on the job with a unique insight into the failures of today's markets and a clear vision of the steps we must take to revive them
the reality is that the economic crisis we face is no longer just an american crisis
it's a global crisis
and we will need to reach out to countries around the world to craft a global response
tim's extensive international experience makes him uniquely suited to do that work
growing up partly in africa and having lived and worked throughout asia, having served as undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, one of the many roles in the international arena, and having studied both chinese and japanese, tim understands the language of today's international markets in more ways than one
tim served with distinction under both democrats and republicans and has a long history of working comfortably and as an honest broker on both sides of the aisle
with stellar performances and outstanding results at every stage of his career, tim has earned the confidence and respect of business, financial, and community leaders, members of congress, and political leaders around the world
and i know he will do so once again as america's next treasury secretary, the chief economic spokesman for my administration
now, like tim, larry summers also brings a singular combination of skill, intellect, and experience to the role he will play in our administration
as undersecretary, deputy secretary, and then secretary of the treasury, larry helped guide us through several major international financial crises and was a central architect of the policies that led to the longest economic expansion in american history, with record surpluses, rising family incomes, and more than 20 million new jobs
he also championed a range of measures, from tax credits to enhanced lending programs to consumer financial protections, that greatly benefited middle-income families
as a thought leader, larry has urged us to confront the problems of income inequality and the middle-class squeeze, consistently arguing that the key to a strong economy is a strong, vibrant, growing middle class
this idea is at the core of my own economic philosophy and will be the foundation of all of my economic policies
and as one of the great economic minds of our time, larry has earned a global reputation for being able to cut to the heart of the most complex and novel policy challenges
with respect to both our current financial crisis and other pressing economic issues of our time, his thinking, writing, and speaking have set the terms of the debate
i'm glad he will be by my side, playing the critical role of coordinating my administration's economic policy in the white house, and i will rely heavily on his advice as we navigate the uncharted waters of this economic crisis
as one of the most expert people in america on economic crises and how to solve them, my next nominee, christina romer, will bring a critically needed perspective to her work as chair of my council of economic advisors
christina is both a leading   both a leading macroeconomist and a leading economic historian, perhaps best known for her work on america's recovery from the great depression and the robust economic expansion that followed
since 2003, she's been co-director of the national bureau of economic research monetary economics program
she's also a member of the bureau's business cycle dating committee, the body charged with officially determining whether a recession has started and ended, experience which will serve her well as she advises me on our current economic challenges
christina has done groundbreaking research on many of the topics our administration will confront, from tax policy to fighting recessions
and her clear-eyed, independent analyses have received praise from both conservative and liberal thinkers alike
i look forward to her wise counsel in the white house
finally, we know that rebuilding our economy will require action on a great variety of fronts
from education and health care to energy and social security
without sound policies in these areas, we can neither enjoy sustained economic growth nor realize our full potential as a people
so i am extraordinarily pleased that melody barnes, one of the most respected policy experts in america, will serve as my director of domestic   the domestic policy council, and that she will be working hand in hand with my economic policy team to chart a course to economic recovery
an integral part of that course will be health care reform, and she will work closely with my secretary of health and human services on that issue
as executive vice president for policy at the center of   at the center for american progress, melody directed a network of policy experts dedicated to finding solutions for struggling middle-class families
she also served as chief counsel to the great senator ted kennedy on the state   senate judiciary committee, working on issues ranging from crime to immigration to bankruptcy, and fighting tirelessly to protect civil rights, women's rights, and religious freedom
melody's brilliant legal mind and her long experience working to secure the liberties on which this nation was founded, as well as to secure the opportunities for those who've been left behind, make her a perfect fit for dpc director
i'm grateful that tim, larry, christina, and melody have accepted my nomination, and i am looking forward to working closely with them in the months ahead
that work starts today, because the truth is, we do not have a minute to waste
right now, our economy is trapped in a vicious cycle
the turmoil on wall street means a new round of belt-tightening for families and businesses on main street, and as folks produce less and consume less, that just deepens the problems in our financial markets
these extraordinary stresses on our financial system require extraordinary policy responses
and my administration will honor the public commitments made by the current administration to address this crisis
further, beyond any immediate actions we may take, we need a recovery plan for both wall street and main street, a plan that stabilizes our financial system and gets credit flowing again, while at the same time addressing our growing foreclosure crisis, helping our struggling auto industry, and creating and saving 2
5 million jobs, jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, modernizing our schools, and creating the clean energy infrastructure of the 21st century
because at this moment, we need to restore both confidence in the markets and restore confidence of middle-class families, who find themselves working harder, earning less, and falling further and further behind
i've asked my economic team to develop recommendations for this plan and to consult with congress, the current administration, and the federal reserve on immediate economic developments over the next two months
i've requested that they brief me on these matters on a daily basis
and in the coming weeks, i will provide the american people and the incoming congress with an overview of their initial recommendations
it is my hope that the new congress will begin work on an aggressive economic recovery plan when they convene in early january so that our administration can hit the ground running
with our economy in distress, we cannot hesitate and we cannot delay
our families can't afford to keep on waiting and hoping for a solution
they can't afford to watch another month of unpaid bills pile up, another semester of tuition slip out of reach, another month where, instead of saving for retirement, they're dipping into their savings just to get by
and i want to repeat
this will not be easy
there are no shortcuts or quick fixes to this crisis, which has been many years in the making, and the economy is likely to get worse before it gets better
full recovery will not happen immediately
and to make the investments we need, we'll have to scour our federal budget, line by line, and make meaningful cuts and sacrifices, as well, something i'll be discussing further tomorrow
despite all of this, i am hopeful about the future
i have full confidence in the wisdom and ingenuity of my economic team and in the hard work, courage, and sacrifice of the american people
and most of all, i believe deeply in the resilience and the spirit of this nation
i know we can work our way out of this crisis because we've done it before
and i know we will succeed once again if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together
that's exactly what i intend to do as president of the united states
let me begin by thanking the bipartisan group of u
governors who convened this meeting
few challenges facing america   and the world   are more urgent than combating climate change
the science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear
sea levels are rising
coastlines are shrinking
we've seen record drought, spreading famine, and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season
climate change and our dependence on foreign oil, if left unaddressed, will continue to weaken our economy and threaten our national security
i know many of you are working to confront this challenge
in particular, i want to commend governor sebelius, governor doyle, governor crist, governor blagojevich and your host, governor schwarzenegger
all of you have shown true leadership in the fight to combat global warming
and we've also seen a number of businesses doing their part by investing in clean energy technologies
but too often, washington has failed to show the same kind of leadership
that will change when i take office
my presidency will mark a new chapter in america's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process
that will start with a federal cap and trade system
we'll establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80% by 2050
further, we'll invest 15 billion dollars each year to catalyze private sector efforts to build a clean energy future
we'll invest in solar power, wind power, and next-generation biofuels
we'll tap nuclear power, while making sure it's safe
and we'll develop clean coal technologies
this investment will not only help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil, making the united states more secure
and it will not only help us bring about a clean energy future, saving the planet
it will also help us transform our industries and steer our country out of this economic crisis by generating five million new green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced
the truth is, the united states can't meet this challenge alone
solving this problem will require all of us working together
i understand that your meeting is being attended by government officials from over a dozen countries, including the uk, canada, mexico, brazil and chile, poland and australia, india and indonesia
and i look forward to working with all nations to meet this challenge in the coming years
let me also say a special word to the delegates from around the world who will gather at poland next month
your work is vital to the planet
while i won't be president at the time of your meeting and while the united states has only one president at a time, i've asked members of congress who are attending the conference as observers to report back to me on what they learn there
and once i take office, you can be sure that the united states will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations, and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change
now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all
delay is no longer an option
denial is no longer an acceptable response
the stakes are too high
the consequences too serious
stopping climate change won't be easy and it won't happen overnight
but i promise you this
when i am president, any governor who's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the white house
any company that's willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in washington
and any nation that's willing to join the cause of combating climate change will have an ally in the united states of america
thank you
this morning we woke up to more sobering news about the state of our economy
the 240,000 jobs lost in october marks the 10th consecutive month that our economy has shed jobs
in total, we've lost nearly 1
2 million jobs this year, and more than 10 million americans are now unemployed
tens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes
their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime, and we're going to have to act swiftly to resolve it
now, the united states has only one government and one president at a time, and until january 20th of next year, that government is the current administration
i've spoken to president bush
i appreciate his commitment to ensuring that his economic policy team keeps us fully informed as developments unfold
and i'm also thankful for his invitation to the white house
immediately after i become president, i'm going to confront this economic crisis head-on by taking all necessary steps to ease the credit crisis, help hardworking families, and restore growth and prosperity
this morning i met with members of my transition economic advisory board, who are standing behind me, alongside my vice president-elect, joe biden
they will help to guide the work of my transition team, working with rahm emanuel, my chief of staff, in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis
we discussed in the earlier meeting several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus on in the days and weeks ahead
first of all, we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provide relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear
a particularly urgent priority is a further extension of   of unemployment insurance benefits for workers who cannot find work in the increasingly weak economy
a fiscal stimulus plan that will jump-start economic growth is long overdue
i've talked about it throughout this   the last few months of the campaign
we should get it done
second, we have to address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on the other sectors of our economy   small businesses that are struggling to meet their payrolls and finance their holiday inventories, and state and municipal governments facing devastating budget cuts and tax increases
we must also remember that the financial crisis is increasingly global and requires a global response
the news coming out of the auto industry this week reminds us of the hardship it faces   hardship that goes far beyond individual auto companies to the countless suppliers, small businesses, and communities throughout our nation who depend on a vibrant american auto industry
the auto industry is the backbone of american manufacturing and a critical part of our attempt to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
i would like to see the administration do everything it can to accelerate the retooling assistance that congress has already enacted
in addition, i have made it a high priority for my transition team to work on additional policy options to help the auto industry adjust, weather the financial crisis, and succeed in producing fuel-efficient cars here in the united states of america
and i was glad to be joined today by governor jennifer granholm, who obviously has great knowledge and great interest on this issue
i've asked my team to explore what we can do under current law and whether additional legislation will be needed for this purpose
third, we will review the implementation of this administration's financial program to ensure that the government's efforts are achieving their central goal of stabilizing financial markets while protecting taxpayers, helping homeowners, and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance
it is absolutely critical that the treasury work closely with the fdic, hud, and other government agencies to use the substantial authority that they already have to help families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes
finally, as we monitor and address these immediate economic challenges, we will be moving forward in laying out a set of policies that will grow our middle class and strengthen our economy in the long term
we cannot afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that i identified during the campaign, including clean energy, health care, education, and tax relief for middle-class families
my transition team will be working on each of these priorities in the weeks ahead, and i intend to reconvene this advisory board to discuss the best ideas for responding to these immediate problems
let me close by saying this
i do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead
we have taken some major action to date, and we will need further action during this transition and subsequent months
some of the choices that we make are going to be difficult
and i have said before and i will repeat again
it is not going to be quick and it is not going to be easy for us to dig ourselves out of the hole that we are in, but america is a strong and resilient country
and i know we will succeed if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together as one nation
that's what i intend to do
hello, chicago
if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible
who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time
who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer
it's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen
by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different
that their voices could be that difference
it's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, democrat and republican, black, white, hispanic, asian, native american, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled   americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states
we are, and always will be, the united states of america
it's the answer that   that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful about what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day
it's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to america
a little bit earlier this evening, i received an extraordinarily gracious call from senator mccain
senator mccain fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves
he has endured sacrifices for america that most of us cannot begin to imagine
we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader
i congratulate him
i congratulate governor palin for all that they've achieved, and i look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead
i want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of scranton and rode with on the train home to delaware, the vice president-elect of the united states, joe biden
and i would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady
michelle obama
sasha and malia, i love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the white house
and while she's no longer with us, i know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who i am
i miss them tonight, and i know that my debt to them is beyond measure
to my sister maya, my sister alma, all my other brothers and sisters   thank you so much for the support that you've given me
i am grateful to them
and to my campaign manager, david plouffe   the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best   the best political campaign, i think, in the history of the united states of america
to my chief strategist david axelrod   who's been a partner with me every step of the way
to the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics   you made this happen, and i am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done
but above all, i will never forget who this victory truly belongs to
it belongs to you
it belongs to you
i was never the likeliest candidate for this office
we didn't start with much money or many endorsements
our campaign was not hatched in the halls of washington
it began in the backyards of des moines and the living rooms of concord and the front porches of charleston
it was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give 5 dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to the cause
it grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep
it drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the earth
this is your victory
and i know you didn't do this just to win an election
and i know you didn't do it for me
you did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead
for even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime
two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century
even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave americans waking up in the deserts of iraq and the mountains of afghanistan to risk their lives for us
there are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education
there's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair
the road ahead will be long
our climb will be steep
we may not get there in one year or even in one term
but, america, i have never been more hopeful than i am tonight that we will get there
i promise you, we as a people will get there
there will be setbacks and false starts
there are many who won't agree with every decision or policy i make as president
and we know the government can't solve every problem
but i will always be honest with you about the challenges we face
i will listen to you, especially when we disagree
and, above all, i will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in america for 221 years   block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand
what began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night
this victory alone is not the change we seek
it is only the chance for us to make that change
and that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were
it can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice
so let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other
let us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving wall street while main street suffers
in this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people
let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long
let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the republican party to the white house, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity
those are values that we all share
and while the democratic party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress
as lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours
we are not enemies but friends
though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection
and to those americans who   whose support i have yet to earn, i may not have won your vote tonight, but i hear your voices
i need your help
and i will be your president, too
and to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of american leadership is at hand
to those   to those who would tear the world down
we will defeat you
to those who seek peace and security
we support you
and to all those who have wondered if america's beacon still burns as bright
tonight we've proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals
democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope
that's the true genius of america
that america can change
our union can be perfected
what we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow
this election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations
but one that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in atlanta
she's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing
ann nixon cooper is 106 years old
she was born just a generation past slavery
a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky
when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons
because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin
and tonight, i think about all that she's seen throughout her century in america   the heartache and the hope
the struggle and the progress
the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that american creed
yes we can
at a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot
yes we can
when there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a new deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose
yes we can
when the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved
yes we can
she was there for the buses in montgomery, the hoses in birmingham, a bridge in selma, and a preacher from atlanta who told a people that we shall overcome
yes we can
a man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination
and this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in america, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how america can change
yes we can
america, we have come so far
we have seen so much
but there is so much more to do
so tonight, let us ask ourselves   if our children should live to see the next century
if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as ann nixon cooper, what change will they see
what progress will we have made
this is our chance to answer that call
this is our moment
this is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids
to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace
to reclaim the american dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one
² that while we breathe, we hope
and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people
yes, we can
thank you
god bless you
and may god bless the united states of america
thank you very much, madam president
and thank you to the distinguished senator from connecticut not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work that he's put in over the last several days and, in fact, over a   a week
and i want to thank his counterparts on the other side, including senator gregg, for their hard work
now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greed and irresponsibility of wall street and some in washington is an outrage
it's an outrage to every american who works hard, pays their taxes, is doing their best every day to make a better life for themselves and their families
and understandably, people are frustrated and they're angry that wall street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk
and they should be
i'm frustrated and angry, too
but while there's plenty of blame to go around   and many in washington and wall street who deserve it, all of us   all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, because it affects the financial well-being of every single american
there will be time to punish those who set this fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in his bed, or leave the stove on
right now we want to put out that fire
and now's the time for us to come together and do that
when the house of representatives failed to act on monday, we saw the single largest decline in the stock market in two decades
over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time the markets closed
and it wasn't just the wealth of a few ceos or wall street executives
the 401(k)s and retirement accounts of millions became smaller
the state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars
hard-working americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it diminish and in some cases disappear
and while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now
we're in a very dangerous situation, where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money
and if all that meant was the failure of a few banks in new york, that would be one thing
but that's not what it means
what it means is, if we don't act, it will be harder for americans to get a mortgage for their home or loans they need to buy a car or send their children to college
what it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a new factory or make payroll for their workers
and if they can't make payroll on friday, then workers are laid off on monday
and if workers are laid off on monday, then they can't pay their bills or pay back their loans to somebody else
and it will go on and on and on, rippling through the entire economy
and potentially we could see thousands of businesses close, millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could follow
in other words, this is not just a wall street crisis
it's an american crisis
and it's the american economy that needs this rescue plan
i understand completely why people would be skeptical when this president asks for a blank check to solve this problem
i was, too, as was senator dodd and a whole bunch of us here
and that's why, over a week ago, i demanded that this plan include some specific proposals to protect taxpayers, protections that the administration eventually agreed to, and, thanks to the hard work of senator dodd and republican counterparts like senator gregg, we here in the senate have agreed to, and now hopefully the house will agree to, as well
let me just go over those principles
number one, i said we needed an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way
number two, i said that we cannot help banks on wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes
they deserve a plan, too
number three, i said that i would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for wall street executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess
and, finally, i said that, if american taxpayers are financing this solution, then they have to be treated like investors
they should get every penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers
now, this last part is important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorly communicated part of this plan
this is not a plan to just hand over 700 billion dollars of taxpayer money to a few banks
if this is managed correctly   and that's an important if   we will hopefully get most or all of our money back and possibly even turn a profit on the government's intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the american people
and if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for the losses that they caused
now, let me   let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is not perfect
democrats and republicans in congress have legitimate concerns about it
some of my closest colleagues, people i have the greatest respect for, still have problems with it and may choose to vote against this bill, and i think that we can respectfully disagree
i understand their frustrations
i also know that many   many americans share their concerns
but it's clear that, from my perspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe
it is conceivable   it's possible that if we did nothing everything would turn out okay
it's   there   there's a possibility that that's true
and there's no doubt that there may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months to develop, might be even more refined and might serve our purposes better
but we don't have that kind of time
and we can't afford to take a risk that the economy of the united states of america and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy could be plunged into a very, very deep hole
so to democrats and republicans who've opposed this plan, i say
step up to the plate
let's do what's right for the country at this time, because the time to act is now
i know many americans are wondering what happens next
and passing this bill can't be the end of our work to strengthen our economy
it must be the beginning
because one thing i   i think all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even if we get this in place, we could still have enormous problems and probably will have big problems in the economy over the next several months and potentially longer
because the fact is, is that we have seen some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time, and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole immediately
so this is not the end
this is the beginning
as soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need to move aggressively with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on main street who are struggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs
they've been in crisis a lot longer than wall street has
i've said it before and i say it again
we need to pass an economic stimulus package that will help ordinary americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can save one million jobs rebuilding our schools, and roads, and our infrastructure, and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increase, a   a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones
that's the right thing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down and we are in great danger of slipping into a big recession
we also must do more in this rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in their homes
i will continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms
i know my colleague from illinois, dick durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many
it is the right thing to do to change our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of staying in their homes and we're not seeing communities devastated all across the country
and we should encourage treasury to study the option of buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the 1930s
and finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared to take more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's necessary
now, just as families are planning for their future in tough times, washington's going to have to do the same
runaway spending and record deficits are not how families run their budgets
it can't be how washington handles people's tax dollars
so we're going to have to return to the fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s
and the next white house and the next congress is going to have to work together to make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid of programs that don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less
with less money flowing into the treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed
and some might be   need to be stretched out over a longer period of time
but there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because our economy is in turmoil
president, i've exceeded the time a little bit
i would like unanimous consent for a couple more minutes
senate president
is there objection
seeing no objection
senator obama
thank you
there are certain investments in our future that we can't delay precisely be   because the economy's in turmoil
we can't wait to help americans keep up with rising costs and shrinking paychecks, and we're going to do that by making sure that we are giving our workers a middle-class tax cut
we can't wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs
we can't wait to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and investing in broadband lines in rural communities, and fixing our electricity grid so we can get renewable energy to population centers that need them
and we need to develop an energy policy that prevents us from sending 700 billion dollars a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil
we can't wait to educate the next generation of americans with the skills and knowledge they need to compete with any workers anywhere in the world
these are the priorities we cannot delay
now, let me just close by saying this
i do not think this is going to be easy
it's not going to come without costs
we are all going to need to sacrifice
we're all going to need to pull our weight, because now, more than ever, we are all in this together
that's part of what this crisis has taught us   that in the end of the day, there's no real separation between wall street and main street
there's only the road we're traveling on as americans
and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation and as one people
i know that many americans are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, about their homes, about their life savings
but i also know this, that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis
we are   always have
during the great financial crisis of the last century, in his first fireside chat, fdr told his fellow americans that,
there is an element in the re-adjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people themselves
confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan
let us unite in banishing fear
together we cannot fail
we cannot fail, not now, not tomorrow, not next year
this is a nation that's faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats
and at each and every moment, we have risen to meet up these challenges, not as democrats, not as republicans, but as americans, with resolve and with confidence, with that fundamental belief that, here in america, our destiny is not written for us, it's written by us
and that's who we are
and that's the country i know we can be right now
i want to thank again the extraordinary leadership of chairman dodd and banking    the banking committee, as well as chairman baucus and majority leader reid
they have worked tirelessly
i want to thank the leadership in the house of representatives
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, understanding that this will not solve all our problems
it is a necessary but not sufficient step to make sure that this economy once again works on behalf of all americans in their pursuit of the american dream
thank you, mr
president
i yield the floor
thank you so much
thank you very much
thank you everybody
to   to chairman dean, and my great friend, dick durbin, and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation, with profound gratitude and great humility   i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
let me   let me express   let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest, a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and yours
hillary rodham clinton
to president clinton   to president bill clinton, who made last night the case for change as only he can make it, to ted kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service, and to the next vice president of the united states, joe biden, i thank you
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night, to the love of my life   the next first lady, michelle obama
and to mahlia and sasha, i love you so much and i am so proud of you
four years ago, i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in america, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
it is that promise that's always set this country apart   that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
it's why i stand here tonight
because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women, students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors   found the courage to keep it alive
we meet at one of those defining moments   a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the american promise has been threatened once more
tonight, more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
more of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit cards bills  you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach
these challenges are not all of government's making
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
bush
america, we are better than these last eight years
we are a better country than this
this country's more decent than one woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one disaster after a lifetime of hard work
we're a better country than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment that's he's worked on for twenty years and watch as its shipped off to china, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets, and families slide into poverty
that sits   that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
tonight   tonight i say to the people of america, to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land
enough
this moment   this moment   this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the american promise alive
because next week, in minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
and we are here   we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
on november 4th   on november 4th, we must stand up and say
eight is enough
now   now let me   let   let there be no doubt
the republican nominee, john mccain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and our respect
and next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
but the record's clear
john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
senator mccain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
i   i don't know about you, but i'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives   on health care and education and the economy, senator mccain has been anything but independent
he says that our economy has made great progress under this president
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong
and when one of his chief advisors   the man who wrote his economic plan   was talking about the anxieties that americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession, and that we've become   and i quote   a nation of whiners
a nation of whiners
tell that to the proud autoworkers at a michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up everyday and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burden silently as they watch their loved ones leave for there third or fourth or fifth tour of duty
these are not whiners
they work hard and they give back and they keep going without complaint
these are the americans i know
now, i don't believe that senator mccain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of americans
i just think he doesn't know
why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
it's not because john mccain doesn't care
it's because john mccain doesn't get it
for over two decades   for over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited republican philosophy
give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
in washington, they call this the ownership society, but what it really means is that you're on your own
out of work
tough luck, you're on your own
no health care
the market will fix it
you're on your own
born into poverty
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, even if you don't have boots
you are on your own
well, it's time for them to own their failure
it's time for us to change america
and that's why i'm running for president of the united states
you see   you see, we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president, when the average american family saw its income go up 7,500 dollars instead of go down 2,000 dollars, like it has under george bush
we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job, an economy that honors the dignity of work
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great, a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
because, in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan, i see my grandfather, who signed up after pearl harbor, marched in patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the g
bill
in the face of that young student, who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, i think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree, who once turned to food stamps, but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
when i   when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business or making her way in the world, i think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
she's the one who taught me about hard work
she's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life
she poured everything she had into me
and although she can no longer travel, i know that she's watching tonight and that tonight is her night, as well
now   now , i don't know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine
these are my heroes
theirs are the stories that shaped my life
and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
what   what is that american promise
it's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect
it's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs, to look out for american workers, and play by the rules of the road
ours   ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education
keep our water clean and our toys safe
invest in new schools, and new roads, and science, and technology
our government should work for us, not against us
it should help us, not hurt us
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every american who's willing to work
that's the promise of america, the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation, the fundamental belief that i am my brother's keeper, i am my sister's keeper
that's the promise we need to keep
that's the change we need right now
so   so let me   let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
you know, unlike john mccain, i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
i'll eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow
i will   listen now   i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for 95 percent of all working families, because, in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
and for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, i will set a clear goal as president
in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
we will do this
washington   washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years
and, by the way, john mccain has been there for 26 of them
and in that time, he has said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investment in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels
and today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day that senator mccain took office
now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution, not even close
as president   as president, i will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
i'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
and i'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy   wind power, and solar power, and the next generation of biofuels   an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced
america, now is not the time for small plans
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy
you know, michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education
and i will not settle for an america where some kids don't have that chance
i'll invest in early childhood education
i'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries, and give them more support
and in exchange, i'll ask for higher standards and more accountability
and we will keep our promise to every young american
if you commit to serving your community or our country, we will make sure you can afford a college education
now   now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single american
if you have health care   if you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums
if you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
and   and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their job and caring for a sick child or an ailing parent
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses, and the time to protect social security for future generations
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because i want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons
now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why i've laid out how i'll pay for every dime
by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help america grow
but i will also go through the federal budget line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less, because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy
and, democrats   democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling america's promise will require more than just money
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f
kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength
yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient
yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair
but we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents, that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework, that fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility, that's the essence of america's promise
and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep america's promise abroad
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate i'm ready to have
for   for while   while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11, i stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that we face
when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan, i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
you know, john mccain likes to say that he'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell, but he won't even follow him to the cave where he lives
and today   today, as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion dollars in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
that's not the judgment we need
that won't keep america safe
we need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
you don't defeat   you don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
you don't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington
you can't truly stand up for georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice, but that is not the change that america needs
we are the party of roosevelt
we are the party of kennedy
so don't tell me that democrats won't defend this country
don't tell me that democrats won't keep us safe
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans, democrats and republicans, have built, and we are here to restore that legacy
as commander-in-chief, i will never hesitate to defend this nation, but i will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts, but i will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century
terrorism and nuclear proliferation, poverty and genocide, climate change and disease
and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future
these   these are the policies i will pursue
and in the weeks ahead, i look forward to debating them with john mccain
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes, because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and each other's patriotism
the times are too serious
the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
so let us agree that patriotism has no party
i love this country, and so do you, and so does john mccain
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents, but they have fought together, and bled together, and some died together under the same proud flag
they have not served a red america or a blue america
they have served the united states of america
so i've got news for you, john mccain
we all put our country first
america, our work will not be easy
the challenges we face require tough choices
and democrats, as well as republicans, will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past, for part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose, and that's what we have to restore
we may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
the   the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
you know, passions may fly on immigration, but i don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
but this, too, is part of america's promise, the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk
they claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer, and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
and that's to be expected, because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters
if you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
you make a big election about small things
and you know what
it's worked before, because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government
when washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty
if your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know
i get it
i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
i don't fit the typical pedigree, and i haven't spent my career in the halls of washington
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
what the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me
it's about you
it's about you
for 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said, enough, to the politics of the past
you understand that, in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same, old politics with the same, old players and expect a different result
you have shown what history teaches us, that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from washington
change comes to washington
change happens   change happens because the american people demand it, because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time
america, this is one of those moments
i believe that, as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming, because i've seen it, because i've lived it
because i've seen it in illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work
i've seen it in washington, where we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans, and keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
and i've seen it in this campaign, in the young people who voted for the first time and the young at heart, those who got involved again after a very long time
in the republicans who never thought they'd pick up a democratic ballot, but did
i've seen it   i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day, even though they can't afford it, than see their friends lose their jobs
in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb
in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise
you know, this country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich
we have the most powerful military on earth, but that's not what makes us strong
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores
instead, it is that american spirit, that american promise, that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain
that binds us together in spite of our differences
that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend
that promise is our greatest inheritance
it's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night and a promise that you make to yours, a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west, a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot
and it is that promise that, 45 years ago today, brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington, before lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
the men and women who gathered there could've heard many things
they could've heard words of anger and discord
they could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred
but what the people heard instead   people of every creed and color, from every walk of life   is that, in america, our destiny is inextricably linked, that together our dreams can be one
we cannot walk alone, the preacher cried
and as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead
we cannot turn back
america, we cannot turn back, not with so much work to be done
not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for
not with an economy to fix, and cities to rebuild, and farms to save
not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
america, we cannot turn back
we cannot walk alone
at this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future
let us keep that promise, that american promise, and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess
thank you
god bless you
and god bless the united states of america
thank you to the citizens of berlin and   and thank you to the people of germany
let me thank chancellor merkel and foreign minister steinmeier for welcoming me earlier today
thank you mayor wowereit, the berlin senate, the police, and most of all thanks to all of you for this extraordinary welcome
thank you
i come to berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before
although tonight, i speak to you not as a candidate for president, but as a citizen   a proud citizen of the united states, and a fellow citizen of the world
i know that i don't look like the americans who've previously spoken in this great city
the journey that led me here is improbable
my mother was born in the heartland of america, but my father grew up herding goats in kenya
his father   his father   my grandfather   was a cook, a domestic servant to the british
at the height of the cold war, my father decided, like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world, that his yearning   his dream   required the freedom and opportunity promised by the west
and so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across america until somebody, somewhere answered his prayer for a better life
that is why i am here
and you are here because you too know that yearning
this city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom
and you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life
ours is a partnership that truly began 60 years ago this summer, on the day when the first american plane touched down at tempelhof
on that day   on that day much of this continent still lay in ruin
the rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall
the soviet shadow had swept across eastern europe, while in the west, america, britain, and france took their stock of their losses, and pondered how the world might be remade
this is where the two sides met
and on the twenty-fourth of june, 1948, the communists chose to blockade the western part of the city
they cut off food and supplies to more than two million germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in berlin
the size of our forces was no match for the larger soviet army
and yet retreat would have allowed communism to march across europe
where the last war had ended, another world war could have easily begun
and all that stood in the way was berlin
and that's when   that's when the airlift began, when the largest and most unlikely rescue in the history brought food and hope to the people of this city
the odds were stacked against success
in the winter, a heavy fog filled the sky above, and many planes were forced to turn back without dropping off the needed supplies
the streets where we stand were filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold
but in the darkest hours, the people of berlin kept the flame of hope burning
the people of berlin refused to give up
and on one fall day, hundreds of thousands of berliners came here, to the tiergarten, and heard the city's mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom
there is only one possibility, he said
for us to stand together united until this battle is won…the people of berlin have spoken
we have done our duty, he said, and we will keep on doing our duty
people of the world, now do your duty
people of the world, look at berlin
people of the world   look at berlin
look at berlin, where germans and americans learned to work together and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on the field of battle
look at berlin, where the determination of a people met the generosity of the marshall plan and created a german miracle
where a   where a victory over tyranny gave rise to nato, the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security
look at berlin, where the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber stones and pillars near the brandenburg gate insist that we never forget our common humanity
people of the world   look at berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again
history has led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and new peril
when you, the german people, tore down that wall   a wall that divided east and west
freedom and tyranny
fear and hope   walls came tumbling down around the world
from kiev to cape town, prison camps were closed, and the doors of democracy were opened
markets opened too, and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity
while the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st century has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history
the fall of the berlin wall brought new hope
but that very closeness has given rise to new dangers   dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean
think about it
the terrorists of september 11th plotted in hamburg and trained in kandahar and karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on american soil
as we speak, cars in boston and factories in beijing are melting the ice caps in the arctic, shrinking coastlines in the atlantic, and bringing drought to farms from kansas to kenya
poorly secured nuclear material in the former soviet union, or secrets from a scientist in pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in paris
the poppies in afghanistan come to berlin in the form of the heroin
the poverty and violence in somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow
the genocide in darfur shames the conscience of us all
in this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them
and that is why we cannot afford to be divided
no one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone
none of us can deny these threats, or escape responsi in meeting them
in the absence of soviet tanks and a terrible wall, it has become easy to forget this truth
and if we're honest with each other, we know that sometimes, on both sides of the atlantic, we have drifted apart, and forgotten our shared destiny
in europe, the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help us make it right, has become all too common
in america, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe's role in our security and our future
both views miss the truth
that europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world
and that just as american bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent, so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe
yes, there have been differences between america and europe
no doubt, there will be differences in the future
but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together
a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden
in this new century, americans and europeans alike will be required to do more   not less
partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice
it is the only way, the one way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another
the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand
the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand
the walls between races and tribes
natives and immigrants
christians and muslims and jews cannot stand
these now are the walls we must tear down
we know   we know that these walls have fallen before
after centuries of strife, the people of europe have formed a union of promise and prosperity
here, at the base of a column built to mark victory in war, we meet in the center of a europe at peace
not only have walls come down in berlin, but they've come down in belfast, where protestant and catholic found a way to live together
in the balkans, where our atlantic alliance ended wars and brought savage war criminals to justice
and in south africa, where the struggle of a courageous people defeated apartheid
so history reminds us that walls can be torn down
but the task is never easy
true partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice
they require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy
of peace and progress
they require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and, most of all, trust each other
that is why america cannot turn inward
that is why europe cannot turn inward
america has no better partner than europe
now   now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as strong as the one that binds us across the atlantic
now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation and strong institutions and shared sacrifice and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century
it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads, and people to assemble where we stand today
and this is the moment when our nations   and all nations   must summon that spirit anew
this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it
if we could create nato to face down the soviet union, we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman
in london and bali
in washington and new york
if we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope
this is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in afghanistan, and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets
no one welcomes war
i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan
but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that nato's first mission beyond europe's borders is a success
for the people of afghanistan, and for our shared security, the work must be done
america can't do this alone
the afghan people need our troops and your troops
our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaeda, to develop their economy, and to help them rebuild their nation
we have too much at stake to turn back now
this   this is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons
the two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love
with that wall gone, we need not stand idly by and watch the further spread of the deadly atom
it is time to secure all loose nuclear materials
to stop the spread of nuclear weapons
and to reduce the arsenals from another era
this is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons
this is the moment when every nation in europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow, free from the shadows of yesterday
in this century, we need a strong european union that deepens the security and prosperity of this continent, while extending a hand abroad
in this century   in this city of all cities   we must reject the cold war mind-set of the past, and resolve to work with russia when we can, to stand up for our values when we must, and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent
this is the moment when we must build on the wealth that opens  markets have created, and share its benefits more equitably
trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development
but we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many
together   together we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful protections for our people and our planet
this is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all
this is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the middle east
my country must stand with yours and with europe in sending a direct message to iran that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions
we must support the lebanese who've marched and bled for democracy, and the israelis and the palestinians who seek a secure and lasting peace
and despite   despite past differences, this is the moment when the world should support the millions of iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close
this   this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet
let us resolve that we will not leave our children to a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands
let us resolve that all nations   including my own   will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere
this   this is the moment to give our children back their future
this is the moment to stand as one
and this is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world
we must remember that the cold war born in this city was not a battle for land or treasure
sixty years ago, the planes that flew over berlin did not drop bombs
instead they delivered food, and coal, and candy to grateful children
and in that show of solidarity, those pilots won more than a military victory
they won hearts and minds
love and loyalty and trust   not just from the people in this city, but from all those who heard the story of what they did here
now the world will watch and remember what we do here   what we do with this moment
will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity, by security and justice
will we lift the child in bangladesh from poverty, and shelter the refugee in chad, and banish the scourge of aids in our time
will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in burma, the blogger in iran, or the voter in zimbabwe
will we give meaning to the words never again in darfur
will we acknowledge   will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world
will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law
will we   will we   will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination against those who don't look like us or worship like we do, and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people
people of berlin   people of the world   this is our moment
this is our time
i know my country has not perfected itself
at times, we've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people
we've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions
but i also know how much i love america
i know that for more than two centuries, we have strived   at great cost and great sacrifice   to form a more perfect union
to seek, with other nations, a more hopeful world
our allegiance has never been to any particular tribe or kingdom   indeed, every language is spoken in our country
every culture has left its imprint on ours
every point of view is expressed in our public squares
what has always united us, what has always driven our people, what drew my father to america's shores   is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people
that we can live free from fear and free from want
that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please
these are the aspiration that join the fates of all nations in this city
these aspirations are bigger than anything that drives us apart
it is because of these aspirations that the airlift began
it is because of these aspirations that all free people   everywhere   became citizens of berlin
it is in pursuit of these aspirations that a new generation   our generation   must make our mark on the world
people of berlin   and people of the world   the scale of our challenge is great
the road ahead will be long
but i come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom
we are a people of improbable hope
with an eye toward the future, with resolve in our heart, let us remember this history, and answer our destiny, and remake the world once again
thank you, berlin
god bless you
thank you
thank you
sixty-one years ago, george marshall announced the plan that would come to bear his name
much of europe lay in ruins
the united states faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination
this menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy life on an unimaginable scale
the soviet union didn't yet have an atomic bomb, but before long it would
the challenge facing the greatest generation of americans   the generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield   was how to contain this threat while extending freedom's frontiers
leaders like truman and acheson, kennan and marshall, knew that there was no single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom
we needed a new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and dangerous world
such a strategy would join overwhelming military strength with sound judgment
it would shape events not just through military force, but through the force of our ideas
through economic power, intelligence and diplomacy
it would support strong allies that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy
open markets and the rule of law
it would foster new international institutions like the united nations, nato, and the world bank, and focus on every corner of the globe
it was a strategy that saw clearly the world's dangers, while seizing its promise
as a general, marshall had spent years helping fdr wage war
but the marshall plan   which was just one part of this strategy   helped rebuild not just allies, but also the nation that marshall had plotted to defeat
in the speech announcing his plan, he concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations   but rather with questions and a call for perspective
the whole world of the future, marshall said, hangs on a proper judgment
to make that judgment, he asked the american people to examine distant events that directly affected their security and prosperity
he closed by asking
what is needed
what can best be done
what must be done
what is needed
what can best be done
what must be done
today's dangers are different, though no less grave
the power to destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the hands of terrorists
the future of our security   and our planet   is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas
from the cave- spotted mountains of northwest pakistan, to the centrifuges spinning beneath iranian soil, we know that the american people cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military alone
the attacks of september 11 brought this new reality into a terrible and ominous focus
on that bright and beautiful day, the world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our cold war victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble, and twisted steel, and clouds of smoke
but the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and determination of our nation
at blood banks and vigils
in schools and in the united states congress, americans were united   more united, even, than we were at the dawn of the cold war
the world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, as old allies, new friends, and even long-time adversaries stood by our side
it was time   once again   for america's might and moral suasion to be harnessed
it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an ever-changing world
imagine, for a moment, what we could have done in those days, and months, and years after 9/11
we could have deployed the full force of american power to hunt down and destroy osama bin laden, al qaida, the taliban, and all of the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in afghanistan
we could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world, and updated a 20th century non-proliferation framework to meet the challenges of the 21st
we could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in alternative sources of energy to grow our economy, save our planet, and end the tyranny of oil
we could have strengthened old alliances, formed new partnerships, and renewed international institutions to advance peace and prosperity
we could have called on a new generation to step into the strong currents of history, and to serve their country as troops and teachers, peace corps volunteers and police officers
we could have secured our homeland   investing in sophisticated new protection for our ports, our trains and our power plants
we could have rebuilt our roads and bridges, laid down new rail and broadband and electricity systems, and made college affordable for every american to strengthen our ability to compete
we could have done that
instead, we have lost thousands of american lives, spent nearly a trillion dollars, alienated allies and neglected emerging threats   all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks
our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we have given them
what's missing in our debate about iraq   what has been missing since before the war began   is a discussion of the strategic consequences of iraq and its dominance of our foreign policy
this war distracts us from every threat that we face and so many opportunities we could seize
this war diminishes our security, our standing in the world, our military, our economy, and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century
by any measure, our single-minded and open-ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe
i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction   to seize this moment's promise
instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face, i want to overcome them
instead of pushing the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military, i want to use all elements of american power to keep us safe, and prosperous, and free
instead of alienating ourselves from the world, i want america   once again   to lead
as president, i will pursue a tough, smart and principled national security strategy   one that recognizes that we have interests not just in baghdad, but in kandahar and karachi, in tokyo and london, in beijing and berlin
i will focus this strategy on five goals essential to making america safer
ending the war in iraq responsibly
finishing the fight against al qaida and the taliban
securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states
achieving true energy security
and rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century
my opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor, and we all respect his sacrifice
we both want to do what we think is best to defend the american people
but we've made different judgments, and would lead in very different directions
that starts with iraq
i opposed going to war in iraq
senator mccain was one of washington's biggest supporters for war
i warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism, and distract us from the fight against al qaida and the taliban
senator mccain claimed that we would be greeted as liberators, and that democracy would spread across the middle east
those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic question since the end of the cold war
now, all of us recognize that we must do more than look back   we must make a judgment about how to move forward
what is needed
what can best be done
what must be done
senator mccain wants to talk of our tactics in iraq
i want to focus on a new strategy for iraq and the wider world
it has been 18 months since president bush announced the surge
as i have said many times, our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence
general petraeus has used new tactics to protect the iraqi population
we have talked directly to sunni tribes that used to be hostile to america, and supported their fight against al qaida
shiite militias have generally respected a cease- fire
those are the facts, and all americans welcome them
for weeks, now, senator mccain has argued that the gains of the surge mean that i should change my commitment to end the war
but this argument misconstrues what is necessary to succeed in iraq, and stubbornly ignores the facts of the broader strategic picture that we face
in the 18 months since the surge began, the strain on our military has increased, our troops and their families have borne an enormous burden, and american taxpayers have spent another $200 billion in iraq
that's over $10 billion each month
that is a consequence of our current strategy
in the 18 months since the surge began, the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated
june was our highest casualty month of the war
the taliban has been on the offensive, even launching a brazen attack on one of our bases
al qaida has a growing sanctuary in pakistan
that is a consequence of our current strategy
in the 18 months since the surge began, as i warned at the outset   iraq's leaders have not made the political progress that was the purpose of the surge
they have not invested tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to rebuild their country
they have not resolved their differences or shaped a new political compact
that's why i strongly stand by my plan to end this war
now, prime minister maliki's call for a timetable for the removal of u
forces presents a real opportunity
it comes at a time when the american general in charge of training iraq's security forces has testified that iraq's army and police will be ready to assume responsibility for iraq's security in 2009
now is the time for a responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes iraq's leaders toward a political solution, rebuilds our military, and refocuses on afghanistan and our broader security interests
george bush and john mccain don't have a strategy for success in iraq   they have a strategy for staying in iraq
they said we couldn't leave when violence was up, they say we can't leave when violence is down
they refuse to press the iraqis to make tough choices, and they label any timetable to redeploy our troops surrender, even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government   not to a terrorist enemy
theirs is an endless focus on tactics inside iraq, with no consideration of our strategy to face threats beyond iraq's borders
at some point, a judgment must be made
iraq is not going to be a perfect place, and we don't have unlimited resources to try to make it one
we are not going to kill every al qaida sympathizer, eliminate every trace of iranian influence, or stand up a flawless democracy before we leave   general petraeus and ambassador crocker acknowledged this to me when they testified last april
that is why the accusation of surrender is false rhetoric used to justify a failed policy
in fact, true success in iraq   victory in iraq   will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down their arms
true success will take place when we leave iraq to a government that is taking responsibility for its future   a government that prevents sectarian conflict, and ensures that the al qaida threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not reemerge
that is an achievable goal if we pursue a comprehensive plan to press the iraqis stand up
to achieve that success, i will give our military a new mission on my first day in office
ending this war
let me be clear
we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months
that would be the summer of 2010   one year after iraqi security forces will be prepared to stand up
two years from now, and more than seven years after the war began
after this redeployment, we'll keep a residual force to perform specific missions in iraq
targeting any remnants of al qaida
protecting our service members and diplomats
and training and supporting iraq's security forces, so long as the iraqis make political progress
we will make tactical adjustments as we implement this strategy   that is what any responsible commander-in-chief must do
as i have consistently said, i will consult with commanders on the ground and the iraqi government
we will redeploy from secure areas first and volatile areas later
we will commit $2 billion to a meaningful international effort to support the more than 4 million displaced iraqis
we will forge a new coalition to support iraq's future   one that includes all of iraq's neighbors, and also the united nations, the world bank, and the european union   because we all have a stake in stability
and we will make it clear that the united states seeks no permanent bases in iraq
this is the future that iraqis want
this is the future that the american people want
and this is what our common interests demand
both america and iraq will be more secure when the terrorist in anbar is taken out by the iraqi army, and the criminal in baghdad fears iraqi police, not just coalition forces
both america and iraq will succeed when every arab government has an embassy open in baghdad, and the child in basra benefits from services provided by iraqi dinars, not american tax dollars
and this is the future we need for our military
we cannot tolerate this strain on our forces to fight a war that hasn't made us safer
i will restore our strength by ending this war, completing the increase of our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 marines, and investing in the capabilities we need to defeat conventional foes and meet the unconventional challenges of our time
so let's be clear
senator mccain would have our troops continue to fight tour after tour of duty, and our taxpayers keep spending $10 billion a month indefinitely
i want iraqis to take responsibility for their own future, and to reach the political accommodation necessary for long-term stability
that's victory
that's success
that's what's best for iraq, that's what's best for america, and that's why i will end this war as president
in fact   as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain   the central front in the war on terror is not iraq, and it never was
that's why the second goal of my new strategy will be taking the fight to al qaida in afghanistan and pakistan
it is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3,000 americans were killed on our soil, the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 are still at large
osama bin laden and ayman al-zawahari are recording messages to their followers and plotting more terror
the taliban controls parts of afghanistan
al qaida has an expanding base in pakistan that is probably no farther from their old afghan sanctuary than a train ride from washington to philadelphia
if another attack on our homeland comes, it will likely come from the same region where 9/11 was planned
and yet today, we have five times more troops in iraq than afghanistan
senator mccain said   just months ago   that afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to iraq
i could not disagree more
our troops and our nato allies are performing heroically in afghanistan, but i have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to iraq
that's what the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said earlier this month
and that's why, as president, i will make the fight against al qaida and the taliban the top priority that it should be
this is a war that we have to win
i will send at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan, and use this commitment to seek greater contributions   with fewer restrictions   from nato allies
i will focus on training afghan security forces and supporting an afghan judiciary, with more resources and incentives for american officers who perform these missions
just as we succeeded in the cold war by supporting allies who could sustain their own security, we must realize that the 21st century's front lines are not only on the field of battle   they are found in the training exercise near kabul, in the police station in kandahar, and in the rule of law in herat
moreover, lasting security will only come if we heed marshall's lesson, and help afghans grow their economy from the bottom up
that's why i've proposed an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance each year, with meaningful safeguards to prevent corruption and to make sure investments are made   not just in kabul   but out in afghanistan's provinces
as a part of this program, we'll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppy-growing for afghan farmers, just as we crack down on heroin trafficking
we cannot lose afghanistan to a future of narco-terrorism
the afghan people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring, because the security of afghanistan and the united states is shared
the greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into afghanistan
we cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and as president, i won't
we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan, pakistan and nato to secure the border, to take out terrorist camps, and to crack down on cross-border insurgents
we need more troops, more helicopters, more satellites, more predator drones in the afghan border region
and we must make it clear that if pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets like bin laden if we have them in our sights
make no mistake
we can't succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy
we must expect more of the pakistani government, but we must offer more than a blank check to a general who has lost the confidence of his people
it's time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the pakistani people
that's why i'm cosponsoring a bill with joe biden and richard lugar to triple non-military aid to the pakistani people and to sustain it for a decade, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaida
we must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience, or face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear-armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical islam
only a strong pakistani democracy can help us move toward my third goal   securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states
one of the terrible ironies of the iraq war is that president bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active nuclear program
but the fact that the president misled us into a misguided war doesn't diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction   in fact, it has only increased it
in those years after world war ii, we worried about the deadly atom falling into the hands of the kremlin
now, we worry about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium   some of it poorly secured   at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries
now, we worry about the breakdown of a non-proliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the cold war
now, we worry   most of all   about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world's deadliest weapons to the world's most dangerous people
terrorists who won't think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in tel aviv or moscow, in london or new york
we cannot wait any longer to protect the american people
i've made this a priority in the senate, where i worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials
i'll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term as president
and i'll develop new defenses to protect against the 21st century threat of biological weapons and cyber-terrorism   threats that i'll discuss in more detail tomorrow
beyond taking these immediate, urgent steps, it's time to send a clear message
america seeks a world with no nuclear weapons
as long as nuclear weapons exist, we must retain a strong deterrent
but instead of threatening to kick them out of the g-8, we need to work with russia to take u
and russian ballistic missiles off hair- trigger alert
to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material
to seek a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons
and to expand the u
-russian ban on intermediate-range missiles so that the agreement is global
by keeping our commitment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, we'll be in a better position to press nations like north korea and iran to keep theirs
in particular, it will give us more credibility and leverage in dealing with iran
we cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that support terror
preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons is a vital national security interest of the united states
no tool of statecraft should be taken off the table, but senator mccain would continue a failed policy that has seen iran strengthen its position, advance its nuclear program, and stockpile 150 kilos of low enriched uranium
i will use all elements of american power to pressure the iranian regime, starting with aggressive, principled and direct diplomacy   diplomacy backed with strong sanctions and without preconditions
there will be careful preparation
i commend the work of our european allies on this important matter, and we should be full partners in that effort
ultimately the measure of any effort is whether it leads to a change in iranian behavior
that's why we must pursue these tough negotiations in full coordination with our allies, bringing to bear our full influence   including, if it will advance our interests, my meeting with the appropriate iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing
we will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the iranian regime
instead, we will present a clear choice
if you abandon your nuclear program, support for terror, and threats to israel, there will be meaningful incentives
if you refuse, then we will ratchet up the pressure, with stronger unilateral sanctions
stronger multilateral sanctions in the security council, and sustained action outside the un to isolate the iranian regime
that's the diplomacy we need
and the iranians should negotiate now
by waiting, they will only face mounting pressure
the surest way to increase our leverage against iran in the long- run is to stop bankrolling its ambitions
that will depend on achieving my fourth goal
ending the tyranny of oil in our time
one of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil
we ship nearly $700 million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil
it pays for terrorist bombs going off from baghdad to beirut
it funds petro-diplomacy in caracas and radical madrasas from karachi to khartoum
it takes leverage away from america and shifts it to dictators
this immediate danger is eclipsed only by the long-term threat from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine
that means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty
africa, the middle east, and south asia
most disastrously, that could mean destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline
this is not just an economic issue or an environmental concern   this is a national security crisis
for the sake of our security   and for every american family that is paying the price at the pump   we must end this dependence on foreign oil
and as president, that's exactly what i'll do
small steps and political gimmickry just won't do
i'll invest $150 billion over the next ten years to put america on the path to true energy security
this fund will fast track investments in a new green energy business sector that will end our addiction to oil and create up to 5 million jobs over the next two decades, and help secure the future of our country and our planet
we'll invest in research and development of every form of alternative energy   solar, wind, and biofuels, as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe
and from the moment i take office, i will let it be known that the united states of america is ready to lead again
never again will we sit on the sidelines, or stand in the way of global action to tackle this global challenge
i will reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new global energy forum that will lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols
we will also build an alliance of oil-importing nations and work together to reduce our demand, and to break the grip of opec on the global economy
we'll set a goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050
and as we develop new forms of clean energy here at home, we will share our technology and our innovations with all the nations of the world
that is the tradition of american leadership on behalf of the global good
and that will be my fifth goal   rebuilding our alliances to meet the common challenges of the 21st century
for all of our power, america is strongest when we act alongside strong partners
we faced down fascism with the greatest war-time alliance the world has ever known
we stood shoulder to shoulder with our nato allies against the soviet threat, and paid a far smaller price for the first gulf war because we acted together with a broad coalition
we helped create the united nations   not to constrain america's influence, but to amplify it by advancing our values
now is the time for a new era of international cooperation
it's time for america and europe to renew our common commitment to face down the threats of the 21st century just as we did the challenges of the 20th
it's time to strengthen our partnerships with japan, south korea, australia and the world's largest democracy   india   to create a stable and prosperous asia
it's time to engage china on common interests like climate change, even as we continue to encourage their shift to a more open and market-based society
it's time to strengthen nato by asking more of our allies, while always approaching them with the respect owed a partner
it's time to reform the united nations, so that this imperfect institution can become a more perfect forum to share burdens, strengthen our leverage, and promote our values
it's time to deepen our engagement to help resolve the arab- israeli conflict, so that we help our ally israel achieve true and lasting security, while helping palestinians achieve their legitimate aspirations for statehood
and just as we renew longstanding efforts, so must we shape new ones to meet new challenges
that's why i'll create a shared security partnership program   a new alliance of nations to strengthen cooperative efforts to take down global terrorist networks, while standing up against torture and brutality
that's why we'll work with the african union to enhance its ability to keep the peace
that's why we'll build a new partnership to roll back the trafficking of drugs, and guns, and gangs in the americas
that's what we can do if we are ready to engage the world
we will have to provide meaningful resources to meet critical priorities
i know development assistance is not the most popular program, but as president, i will make the case to the american people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common security of the entire world
that was true with the marshall plan, and that must be true today
that's why i'll double our foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012, and use it to support a stable future in failing states, and sustainable growth in africa
to halve global poverty and to roll back disease
to send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, you matter to us
your future is our future
and our moment is now
this must be the moment when we answer the call of history
for eight years, we have paid the price for a foreign policy that lectures without listening
that divides us from one another   and from the world   instead of calling us to a common purpose
that focuses on our tactics in fighting a war without end in iraq instead of forging a new strategy to face down the true threats that we face
we cannot afford four more years of a strategy that is out of balance and out of step with this defining moment
none of this will be easy, but we have faced great odds before
when general marshall first spoke about the plan that would bear his name, the rubble of berlin had not yet been built into a wall
but marshall knew that even the fiercest of adversaries could forge bonds of friendship founded in freedom
he had the confidence to know that the purpose and pragmatism of the american people could outlast any foe
today, the dangers and divisions that came with the dawn of the cold war have receded
now, the defeat of the threats of the past has been replaced by the transnational threats of today
we know what is needed
we know what can best be done
we know what must done
now it falls to us to act with the same sense of purpose and pragmatism as an earlier generation, to join with friends and partners to lead the world anew
thank you
thank you
what a   what a wonderful reception
thank you, saint paul
thank you, minnesota
thank you, joann syverson, for the wonderful introduction
thank you, michelle obama and malia obama and sasha obama
thank you to my brothers and sisters
thank you to   thank you to my staff
thank you to our volunteers
thank you to my political team
thank you to our campaign manager, david plouffe, who never gets any credit, but has built the best political organization in the country
thank you to my grandmother, who helped raise me, and is sitting in hawaii somewhere right now because she can't travel, but who poured everything she had into me, and who helped to make me the man i am today
tonight is for her
tonight, minnesota, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end
sixteen   sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield, illinois
thousands of miles have been traveled
millions of voices have been heard
and because of what you said, because you decided that change must come to washington, because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest, because   because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears, but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another, a journey   a journey that will bring a new and better day to america
because of you, tonight i can stand here and say that i will be the democratic nominee for the president of the united states of america
i want to   i want to thank   i want to thank   i want to thank all those in montana and south dakota who stood up for change today
i want to thank every american who stood with us over the course of this campaign, through the good days and the bad, from the snows of cedar rapids to the sunshine of sioux falls
and, tonight, i also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for president
you know, at this defining moment   at this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for office
i have not just competed with them as rivals
i've learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love america and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better
they are leaders of this party and leaders that america will turn to for years to come
and that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else
senator hillary clinton has made history in this campaign
she has made history not   not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight
i congratulate her on her victory in south dakota, and i congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest
we've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months
but as someone who's shared a stage with her many times, i can tell you that what gets hillary clinton up in the morning   even in the face of tough odds   is exactly what sent her and bill clinton to sign up for their first campaign in texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the children's defense fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the united states senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency
an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be
and you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country   and we will win that fight   she will be central to that victory
when we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen
our party and our country are better off because of her, and i am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with hillary rodham clinton
there are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided
well, i say that, because of this primary, there are millions of americans who've cast their ballot for the very first time
there are   there are independents and republicans who understand this election isn't just about a change of party in washington, but also about the need to change washington
there are   there are young people, and african-americans, and hispanic-americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation
all of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply
but at the end of the day, we aren't the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard
you didn't do that   you didn't do that because of me or senator clinton or anyone else
you did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what we've been doing
we owe our children a better future
we owe our country a better future
and for all those who dream of that future tonight, i say
let us begin the work together
let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for america
in just   in just a few short months, the republican party will arrive in st
paul with a very different agenda
they will   they will come here to nominate john mccain, a man who has served this country heroically
i honor, we honor the service of john mccain, and i respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine
my   my differences with him   my differences with him are not personal
they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while john mccain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign
it's not change when john mccain decided to stand with george bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the senate last year
it's not change when he offers four more years of bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average american family, and widened the gap between wall street and main street, and left our children with a mountain of debt
it's not change when he promises to continue a policy in iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the american people any safer
so   so, i'll say this
there are many words to describe john mccain's attempt to pass off his embrace of george bush's policies as bipartisan and new, but change is not one of them
change is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesn't begin and end with a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged
i won't stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in iraq, but what's not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to america is being ignored
we   we must be   we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in, but we   but start leaving we must
it's time for iraqis to take responsibility for their future
it's time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home
it's time   it's time to refocus our efforts on al qaida's leadership and afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century
terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease
that's what change is
change   change, minnesota, is realizing that meetings  today's threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy
tough   tough, direct diplomacy, where the president of the united states isn't afraid to let any petty dictator know where america stands and what we stand for
we must once again have the courage and the conviction to lead the free world
that is the legacy of roosevelt and truman and kennedy
that's what the american people demand
that's what change is
change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it
it's understanding that the struggles facing working families can't be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy ceos, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation
it's understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when bill clinton was president
john mccain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy   cities in michigan, and ohio, and right here in minnesota   he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for
maybe if he went to iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill, he'd understand she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy
she needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every american who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it
that's the change we need, minnesota
maybe   maybe if john mccain went to pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he'd understand we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators
that man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced
that's the change we need, minnesota
and maybe if john mccain spent some time in the schools of south carolina or st
paul, minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in new orleans, louisiana, he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for no child left behind
that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education
and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support
and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every american
that's the change we need in america
that's why i'm running for president of the united states
now   now, the other side will come here in september and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a good thing
that is a debate i look forward to
it is a debate that the american people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country and the future for our children
but what you don't deserve is another election that's governed by fear, and innuendo, and division
what you won't hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon
what you won't see from this campaign or this party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves democrats and republicans, but we are americans first
we are always americans first
despite   despite what the good senator from arizona may have said tonight, i've seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and i've brought many together myself
i've walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the south side of chicago and watched tensions fade as black and white and latino fought together for good jobs and good schools
i've sat across the table from law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent 13 innocent people to death row
i've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the american people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and to reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in washington
in our country   in our country, i have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in washington, americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes
and every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again
so it was for that band of patriots who declared in a philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and for all those who gave on the fields of gettysburg and antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union
so it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity
so it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines, the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children who braved a selma bridge for freedom's cause
so it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that's better and kinder and more just
and so it must be for us
america, this is our moment
this is our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past, our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love
the journey will be difficult
the road will be long
i face this challenge   i face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but i also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the american people
because if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then i am absolutely certain that, generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless
this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
this was the moment when we ended a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth
this was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals
thank you, minnesota
god bless you
god bless the united states of america
thank you so much
thank you
thank you
thank you so much
thank you
thank you
let me begin by thanking harris wofford for his contributions to this country
in so many different ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word citizen
and so we are very grateful to him for all the work he has done
and i'm thankful for the gracious and thoughtful introduction
we the people, in order to form a more perfect union
two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched america's improbable experiment in democracy
farmers and scholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787
the document they produced was eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished
it was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations
of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution   a constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law
a constitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time
and yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the united states
what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part   through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk   to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time
this was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign
to continue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring, and more prosperous america
i chose to run for president at this moment in history because i believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes
that we may not look the same and may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction
towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren
and this belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the american people
but it also comes from my own story
i'm the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas
i was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a depression to serve in patton's army during world war ii, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at fort leavenworth while he was overseas
i've gone to some of the best schools in america and i've lived in one of the world's poorest nations
i am married to a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters
i have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents
and for as long as i live, i will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible
it's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional of candidates
but it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts   that out of many, we are truly one
now throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the american people were for this message of unity
despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country
in south carolina, where the confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of african americans and white americans
this is not to say that race has not been an issue in this campaign
at various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either too black or not black enough
we saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the south carolina primary
the press has scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well
and yet, it's only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn
on one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action
that it's based solely on the desire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap
on the other end, we've heard my former pastor, jeremiah wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white and black alike
now i've already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of reverend wright that have caused such controversy, and in some cases, pain
for some, nagging questions remain
did i know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of american domestic and foreign policy
of course
did i ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while i sat in the church
yes
did i strongly disagree with many of his political views
absolutely, just as i'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagree
but the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial
they weren't simply a religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice
instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america
a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam
as such, reverend wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity
racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems
two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis, and potentially devastating climate change   problems that are neither black or white or latino or asian, but rather problems that confront us all
given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough
why associate myself with reverend wright in the first place, they may ask
why not join another church
and i confess that if all that i knew of reverend wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television sets and youtube, if trinity united church of christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that i would react in much the same way
but the truth is, that isn't all that i know of the man
the man i met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor
he is a man who served his country as a united states marine, and who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who over 30 years has led a church that serves the community by doing god's work here on earth   by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from hiv/aids
in my first book, dreams from my father, i described the experience of my first service at trinity, and it goes as follows
people began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up to the rafters
and in that single note   hope   i heard something else
at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath, moses and pharaoh, the christians in the lion's den, ezekiel's field of dry bones
those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our stories, my story
the blood that spilled was our blood
the tears our tears
until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world
our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black
in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about   memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild
that has been my experience at trinity
like other predominantly black churches across the country, trinity embodies the black community in its entirety   the doctor and the welfare mom, the model student and the former gang-banger
like other black churches, trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor
they are full of dancing and clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear
the church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and, yes, the bitterness and biases that make up the black experience in america
and this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with reverend wright
as imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me
he strengthens my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children
not once in my conversations with him have i heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect
he contains within him the contradictions   the good and the bad   of the community that he has served diligently for so many years
i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community
i can no more disown him than i can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
these people are part of me
and they are part of america, this country that i love
now, some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable
i can assure you it is not
and i suppose the politically safe thing to do would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork
we can dismiss reverend wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed geraldine ferraro in the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deep   deep-seated bias
but race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
we would be making the same mistake that reverend wright made in his offending sermons about america
to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality
the fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect
and if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every american
understanding   understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point
as william faulkner once wrote, the past isn't dead and buried
in fact, it isn't even past
we do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country
but we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the african-american community and the larger american community today can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools
we still haven't fixed them, 50 years after brown versus board of education
and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students
legalized discrimination, where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to african-american business owners, or black homeowners could not access fha mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or the fire department meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations
that history helps explain the wealth and income gap between blacks and whites and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in so many of today's urban and rural communities
a lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion of black families, a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened
and the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods   parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pick-up, building code enforcement   all helped create a cycle of violence, blight, and neglect that continues to haunt us
this is the reality in which reverend wright and other african-americans of his generation grew up
they came of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted
what's remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame the odds, how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them
but for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the american dream, there were many who didn't make it   those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination
that legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations   those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future
even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their world view in fundamental ways
for the men and women of reverend wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years
that anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, but it does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table
at times, that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politician's own failings
and occasionally it finds voice in the church on sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews
the fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of reverend wright's sermons simply reminds us of that old truism that the most segregated hour of american life occurs on sunday morning
that   that anger is not always productive
indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems
it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the african-american community in our own condition
it prevents the african-american community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change
but the anger is real
it is powerful, and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races
in fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community
most working and middle-class white americans don't feel that they've been particularly privileged by their race
their experience is the immigrant experience
as far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything
they built it from scratch
they've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor
they are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away
and in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense
so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town, when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time
like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company
but they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation
anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the reagan coalition
politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends
talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism
and just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze
a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed
a washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests
economic policies that favor the few over the many
and yet, to wish away the resentments of white americans, to label them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns, this, too, widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding
this is where we are right now
it's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years
and contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidate, particularly   particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
but i have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people, that, working together, we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice   we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union
for the african-american community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past
it means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of american life
but it also means binding our particular grievances, for better health care and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all americans   the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family
and it means also taking full responsibility for our own lives   by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism
they must always believe   they must always believe that they can write their own destiny
ironically, this quintessentially american   and, yes, conservative   notion of self-help found frequent expression in reverend wright's sermons
but what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change
the profound mistake of reverend wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society
it's that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had been made, as if this country   a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, latino, asian, rich, poor, young and old   is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past
what we know, what we have seen, is that america can change
that is true genius of this nation
what we have already achieved gives us hope   the audacity to hope   for what we can and must achieve tomorrow
now, in the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the african-american community does not just exist in the minds of black people
that the legacy of discrimination   and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past   that these things are real and must be addressed
not just with words, but with deeds   by investing in our schools and our communities
by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system
by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations
it requires all americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams, that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of america prosper
in the end, then, what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world's great religions demand
that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us
let us be our brother's keeper, scripture tells us
let us be our sister's keeper
let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well
for we have a choice in this country
we can accept a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism
we can tackle race only as spectacle, as we did in the o
trial
or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of katrina
or as fodder for the nightly news
we can play reverend wright's sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the american people think that i somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words
we can pounce on some gaffe by a hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card
or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to john mccain in the general election regardless of his policies
we can do that
but if we do, i can tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other distraction, and then another one, and then another one
and nothing will change
that is one option
or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, not this time
this time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and asian children and hispanic children and native-american children
this time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn
that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem
the children of america are not those kids,   they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st-century economy
not this time
this time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and hispanics who do not have health care, who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in washington, but who can take them on if we do it together
this time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life
this time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job
it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit
this time   this time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag
we want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged
and we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism by caring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits that they have earned
i would not be running for president if i didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of americans want for this country
this union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected
and today, whenever i find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation   the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election
there's one story in particular that i'd like to leave you with today, a story i told when i had the great honor of speaking on dr
king's birthday at his home church, ebenezer baptist, in atlanta
there's a young, 23-year-old woman, a white woman named ashley baia, who organized for our campaign in florence, south carolina
she'd been working to organize a mostly african-american community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there
and ashley said that when she was 9 years old, her mother got cancer
and because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care
they had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom
she knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches   because that was the cheapest way to eat
that's the mind of a 9 year old
she did this for a year until her mom got better
and so ashley told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she had joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too
now, ashley might have made a different choice
perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or hispanics who were coming into the country illegally
but she didn't
she sought out allies in her fight against injustice
anyway, ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign
they all have different stories and different reasons
many bring up a specific issue
and finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time
and ashley asks him why he's there
and he doesn't bring up a specific issue
he does not say health care or the economy
he does not say education or the war
he does not say that he was there because of barack obama
he simply says to everyone in the room, i am here because of ashley
i'm here because of ashley
now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough
it is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children
but it is where we start
it is where our union grows stronger
and as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the 221 years since a band of patriots signed that document right here in philadelphia, that is where perfection begins
thank you very much, everyone
thank you
thank you, south carolina
thank you to the rock of my life, michelle obama
thank you to malia and sasha obama, who haven't seen their daddy in a week
thank you to pete skidmore for his outstanding service to our country and being such a great supporter of this campaign
you know, over two weeks ago we saw the people of iowa proclaim that our time for change has come
but there were those who doubted this country's desire for something new, who said iowa was a fluke, not to be repeated again
well, tonight the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of south carolina
after four great contests in every corner of this country, we have the most votes, the most delegates   and the most diverse coalition of americans that we've seen in a long, long time
you can see it in the faces here tonight
there are young and old, rich and poor
they are black and white, latino and asian and native american
they are democrats from des moines and independents from concord and, yes, some republicans from rural nevada
and we've got young people all across this country who've never had a reason to participate until now
and in nine days, in nine short days, nearly half the nation will have the chance to join us in saying that we are tired of business as usual in washington
we are hungry for change, and we are ready to believe again
but if there's anything, though, that we've been reminded of since iowa, it's that the kind of change we seek will not come easy
now, partly because we have fine candidates in this field, fierce competitors who are worthy of our respect and our admiration   and as contentious as this campaign may get, we have to remember that this is a contest for the democratic nomination and that all of us share an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration
but there are real differences between the candidates
we are looking for more than just a change of party in the white house
we're looking to fundamentally change the status quo in washington
it's a status quo that extends beyond any particular party
and right now that status quo is fighting back with everything it's got, with the same old tactics that divide and distract us from solving the problems people face, whether those problems are health care that folks can't afford or a mortgage they cannot pay
so this will not be easy
make no mistake about what we're up against
we're up against the belief that it's all right for lobbyists to dominate our government, that they are just part of the system in washington
but we know that the undue influence of lobbyists is part of the problem, and this election is our chance to say that we are not going to let them stand in our way anymore
we're up against the conventional thinking that says your ability to lead as president comes from longevity in washington or proximity to the white house
but we know that real leadership is about candor and judgment and the ability to rally americans from all walks of life around a common purpose, a higher purpose
we're up against decades of bitter partisanship that cause politicians to demonize their opponents instead of coming together to make college affordable or energy cleaner
it's the kind of partisanship where you're not even allowed to say that a republican had an idea, even if it's one you never agreed with
that's the kind of politics that is bad for our party
it is bad for our country
and this is our chance to end it once and for all
we're up against the idea that it's acceptable to say anything and do anything to win an election
but we know that this is exactly what's wrong with our politics
this is why people don't believe what their leaders say anymore
this is why they tune out
and this election is our chance to give the american people a reason to believe again
but let me say this, south carolina
what we've seen in these last weeks is that we're also up against forces that are not the fault of any one campaign but feed the habits that prevent us from being who we want to be as a nation
it's a politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon, a politics that tells us that we have to think, act, and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us, the assumption that young people are apathetic, the assumption that republicans won't cross over, the assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor and that the poor don't vote, the assumption that african-americans can't support the white candidate, whites can't support the african-american candidate, blacks and latinos cannot come together
we are here tonight to say that that is not the america we believe in
i did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white south carolina or a black south carolina
i saw south carolina   because in the end, we're not up just against the ingrained and destructive habits of washington
we're also struggling with our own doubts, our own fears, our own cynicism
the change we seek has always required great struggle and great sacrifice
and so this is a battle in our own hearts and minds about what kind of country we want and how hard we're willing to work for it
so let me remind you tonight that change will not be easy
change will take time
there will be setbacks and false starts, and sometimes we'll make mistakes
but as hard as it may seem, we cannot lose hope, because there are people all across this great nation who are counting on us, who can't afford another four years without health care
they can't afford another four years without good schools
they can't afford another four years without decent wages because our leaders couldn't come together and get it done
theirs are the stories and voices we carry on from south carolina   the mother who can't get medicaid to cover all the needs of her sick child
she needs us to pass a health care plan that cuts costs and makes health care available and affordable for every single american
that's what she's looking for
the teacher who works another shift at dunkin' donuts after school just to make ends meet   she needs us to reform our education system so that she gets better pay and more support and that students get the resources that they need to achieve their dreams
the maytag worker who's now competing with his own teenager for a $7-an-hour job at the local wal-mart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors   he needs us to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working americans who deserve it   and put them in the pockets of struggling homeowners who are having a tough time, and looking after seniors who should retire with dignity and respect
that woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for iraq, or the soldier who doesn't know his child because he's on his third or fourth or even fifth tour of duty   they need us to come together and put an end to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged
so understand this, south carolina
the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders
it's not about rich versus poor, young versus old, and it is not about black versus white
this election is about the past versus the future
it's about whether we settle for the same divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today or whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation, a politics of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity
there are those who will continue to tell us that we can't do this, that we can't have what we're looking for, that we can't have what we want, that we're peddling false hopes
but here's what i know
i know that when people say we can't overcome all the big money and influence in washington, i think of that elderly woman who sent me a contribution the other day, an envelope that had a money order for $3
01   along with a verse of scripture tucked inside the envelope
so don't tell us change isn't possible
that woman knows change is possible
when i hear the cynical talk that blacks and whites and latinos can't join together and work together, i'm reminded of the latino brothers and sisters i organized with and stood with and fought with side by side for jobs and justice on the streets of chicago
so don't tell us change can't happen
when i hear that we'll never overcome the racial divide in our politics, i think about that republican woman who used to work for strom thurmond, who's now devoted to educating inner-city children, and who went out into the streets of south carolina and knocked on doors for this campaign
don't tell me we can't change
yes, we can
yes, we can change
yes, we can
yes, we can heal this nation
yes, we can seize our future
and as we leave this great state with a new wind at our backs, and we take this journey across this great country, a country we love, with the message we've carried from the plains of iowa to the hills of new hampshire, from the nevada desert to the south carolina coast, the same message we had when we were up and when we were down, that out of many we are one, that while we breathe we will hope, and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the american people in three simple words
yes, we can
thank you, south carolina
i love you
scripture tells us that when joshua and the israelites arrived at the gates of jericho, they could not enter
the walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb
they were too strong to be taken down by brute force
and so, the people sat for days, unable to pass on through
but god had a plan for his people
he told them to stand together and march together around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard the sound of the ram's horn, they should speak with one voice
and, at the chosen hour when the horn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together, the mighty walls of jericho came tumbling down
that's what scripture tells us
and there are many lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to take from this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church
as i was thinking about which ones we needed to remember at this hour, my mind went back to the very beginning of the modern civil rights era
because before memphis and the mountaintop, before the bridge in selma and the march on washington, before birmingham and the beatings, the fire hoses, and the loss of those four little girls, before there was king the icon and his magnificent dream, there was king the young preacher and a people who found themselves suffering under the yolk of oppression
and on the eve of the bus boycotts in montgomery, at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a time when there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each other, but mistrusted themselves   king inspired with words not of anger, but of an urgency, a fierce urgency that still speaks to us today
unity, he said, is the great need of the hour
unity is the great need of the hour
unity is how we shall overcome
what dr
king understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri the bus, those walls of oppression would not be moved
but maybe if a few more decided to walk, those foundations might start to shake
if just a few women were willing to do what rosa parks had been willing to do, maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show
if teenagers took rides from north to south, maybe a few bricks would come loose
maybe if white folks marched because they'd come to understand that their freedom was wrapped up in the freedom of others, that they too had a stake in the impending battle, the walls would begin to sway, and if enough americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined together north and south, rich and poor, jew and gentile, then perhaps that wall would come tumbling down, and justice would flow like waters of righteousness, like a mighty stream
unity is the great need of the hour
that's what dr
king said
it is the great need of this hour as well, not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, but because it's the only way we can overcome the essential deficit that exits in this country
i'm not talking about the budget deficit
i'm not talking about the trade deficit
talking about the moral deficit in this country
i'm talking about an empathy deficit, the inability to recognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper, that in the words of dr
king, we are all tied together in a single garment of destiny
we have an empathy deficit when we're still sending our children down corridors of shame, schools in the forgotten corners of america where the color of your skin still affects the content of your education
we have a deficit when ceos are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers are making in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous lenders can make a profit, when mothers can't afford a doctor when their children are stricken with illness
we have a deficit in this country when we have scooter libby justice for some and jena justice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from a school yard tree today, in the present, in the 21st century
we have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities, when innocents are slaughtered in the deserts of darfur, when young americans serve tour after tour after tour after tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged
we have an empathy deficit in this country that has to be closed
we have a deficit when it takes a breach in the levees to reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terrible storm to reveal the hungry that god calls on us to feed, the sick that he calls on us to care for, the least of these that he commands that we treat as our own
so, we have a deficit to close
we have walls, barriers to justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, we know that unity is the great need of the hour
however, all too often, when we talk about unity in this country, we've come to believe that it can be purchased on the cheap
we've come to believe that racial reconciliation can come easily
that it's just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past, and that if the demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply go away then all our problems will be solved
all too often, we seek to ignore the profound structural and institutional barriers that stand in the way of insuring opportunity for all of our children, or decent jobs for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick
we offer unity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required
of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased
it starts with a change in attitudes
it starts with changing our hearts, and changing our minds, broadening our spirit
it's not easy to stand in somebody else's shoes
it's not easy to see past our own differences
we've all encountered this in our own lives
what makes it even more difficult is that we have a politics in this country that seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us
we are told that those who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, that our problems are the fault of those who don't think like us or look like us or come from where we do
the welfare queen, she's taking our money
the immigrant, he's taking our jobs
the believer condemns the nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for being intolerant
and for most of this country's history, we in the african-american community have been at the receiving end of man's inhumanity to man
and all of us understand insidious   all of us understand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays on the job and in the schools, in our health care system, and in our criminal justice system
and yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean
if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to king's vision of a beloved community
if we're honest with ourselves, we have to admit that there have been times when we've scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them
the scourge of anti-semitism has at times revealed itself in our community
for too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as competitors for jobs instead of companions in the fight for opportunity
everyday our politics fuels and exploits this kind of division across all races and regions, across gender and party
it is played out on television
it is sensationalized by the media
last week, it crept into the campaign for president with charges and countercharges that serve to obscure the issues instead of illuminating the critical choices we face as a nation
none of our hands are clean
so let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds
the divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease with which we blame the plight of ourselves on others   all of that distracts us from the common challenges that we face, war and poverty, inequality and injustice
we can no longer afford to build ourselves up by tearing each other down
we can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear or hate
it's the poison that we must purge from our politics, the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late
because if dr
king could love his jailer, if he could call on the faithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs and fire hoses upon them, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time and bind up our wounds and erase the sympathy deficit that exists in our hearts
but if changing our hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there
it's not enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain unwilling to push our elected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools
it's not enough to decry the disparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies to block real reform in our health care system
it's not enough   it's not enough for us to abhor the costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue to allow ourselves to be driven by a politics of fear that sees the threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to come together in a common effort
scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word but by deed
and if we are truly to bring about the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, we have to find it within ourselves to act on what we know, to understand that living up to this country's ideals and its possibilities is going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and stamina
we can't pass a law called no child left behind and then leave the money behind
that is not a serious effort in bringing about the unity that is needed
we can't celebrate dr
king's dream, and yet still have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised at the beginning of this nation
that is what is at stake in this great debate we are having today
changes that are needed are not just a matter of tinkering around the edges
they will not come if politicians simply tell us what we want to hear
all of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice
none of us will be exempt from responsibility
we've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have to challenge ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put away the video game, and our men have to be home with our children
that, too, is part of the challenge that we must make
we will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have to acknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own communities, in too many of the hearts of our young people, and we have to break the grip of that violence wherever we see it
that's how we're going to bring about the change that we seek
that's how dr
king led this country through the wilderness
he did it with words, words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children of slave owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just christian but also jew and muslim and buddhists and atheists, not just the southerner but also the northerner
he led with words, but he also led with deeds
he also led by example
he led by marching and going to jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family
he led by taking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity
he led by challenging our economic structures, understanding that it would cause discomfort
king understood that unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it through great effort and determination
that's the unity, the hard earned unity that we need right now
that is the effort, the determination that can transform blind optimism into hope
you know people have remarked on the fact that i talk about hope a lot in my campaign
you know they   they tease me a little bit
some have been scornful
they say, ah, he's talking about hope again
he's so idealistic
he's so naïve
he's a hope monger
that's okay
it's true
i talk about hope
i talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here today are so small, so remote that i couldn't of gotten here without some hope
you know my   my daddy left me when i was two years old
i needed some hope to get here
i was raised by a single mother
i needed some hope to get here
i got in trouble when i was a teenager, did some things folks now like to talk about
i needed some hope to get here
i wasn't born into money, or great wealth, or great privilege, or status
i was given love, an education, and some hope
that's what i got
that's my birthright
so i talk about hope
i   i put hope on my campaign signs
it doesn't even have my name on them sometimes   just says hope
folks don't know who they're voting for, but it makes them feel good
say, you know, huh
i spoke about hope at the democratic convention
i   i wrote a book called the audacity of hope
and so i   so i'm puzzled when   when some people, some of the other candidates make a mockery of the idea
they say i'm pedaling false hopes
get a reality check, they tell me
and i have to   i have to try to understand what they're saying
the implication is is that if you are hopeful, that you somehow must be engaging in wishful thinking
your   your head must be in the clouds
that you must be passive and just sit back and wait for things to happen to you
that seems to be the implication
and so i have to explain to people that's not what hope is
hope is not blind optimism
hope is not ignorance of the barriers and hurdles and hazards that stand in your way
hope's just the opposite
i know how hard it will be to provide health care to every single american
the insurance companies, drug companies, they don't want to give up their profits
i know it won't be easy to have a energy policy that makes sense for america because the oil companies like writing the energy bills
i know that alleviating poverty, or making sure all our children can learn, or eliminating the scourge of racism in our society   none of those things lend themselves to simple solutions
i know because i fought on the streets as a community organizer in poor neighborhoods on the southside of chicago alongside those without jobs or without prospects for the future
i have fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney for those who had been denied opportunity on the job or denied access to the ballot box
i've seen good legislation die because   well, i've seen that too   i've seen good legislation die because good intentions weren't enough, because they weren't fortified with a political majority and political will
i've seen this country   this country's judgment clouded by fear
i know how easily a country can be misled when it is afraid
i know how hard it is
everybody here understands how difficult it is to bring about true change, change that we can believe in
but i also know this   that nothing in this country worthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere decided to hope
that's how this country was founded because a group of patriots decided they were going to take on the british empire
nobody was putting their money on them
that's how slaves and abolitionists resisted that evil system
that's how a new president was able to chart a course to insure that this nation would no longer remain half slave and half free
that's how the greatest generation defeated fascism and overcame a great depression
that's how women won the right to vote
that's how workers won the right to organize
that's how young people and old people and middle-aged folks were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, and folks came down on freedom rides
they marched, and they sat in, and they were beaten and fire houses were sent on them, and dogs were sent on them, and some went to jail, and some died for freedom's cause
that's what hope is
imagining and then fighting for and struggling for and sometimes dying for what didn't seem possible before
there's nothing naïve about that
there are no false hopes in that
i don't believe in false hopes
imagine if john f
kennedy had looked up at the moon and said, well, that's too far
false hopes, we can't go there
if dr
king had stood on the lincoln memorial and said, y'all go home
we can't overcome
there's no such thing as false hopes, but what i know deep in my heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified, unless we do it together
change does not happen from the top down   in america or anywhere else
it happens from the bottom up
it happens because ordinary people dream extraordinary things
it's because all of you decide that change must come
that i know
it wasn't just one voice   it wasn't just one voice that shouted out before the walls of jericho
all the voices came together, a chorus of voices
that's what gives me hope
not just those who ascend to high office, but the changes that are happening in ordinary places
the stories that give me my hope don't happen in the spotlight
when i think about dr
king, i suspect he was sustained not by having dinner with presidents
not by getting the nobel peace prize
but coming back to church and seeing the mothers of the church and the deacons
those who maintained their dignity were standing up straight in the face of injustice
that's where he drew his hope
he saw god in their faces
those stories don't happen on a presidential stage
they happen in the quiet quarters of our lives
they happen in the moments we least expect
so, let me close by giving an example of one of those stories
there is a young woman, 23 years old, white woman, named ashley baia, who organizes for our campaign in florence, south carolina
ashley has been working to organize mostly black folks
she's in florence, south carolina
she's been doing it since the beginning of the campaign, and the other day she
set up a round table discussion where everyone around was telling their story about who they were and why they were there
and so, ashley explained, she started things off, by explaining why she was there
and she explained that when she was nine years old her mother got cancer, and because she had to miss a day of work she was let go
and she lost her health care
and then she had to file for bankruptcy
they were on hard times, and that's when ashley, nine-years-old at the time, decided she had to do something to help her mom, and she knew that food was one of their most expensive costs
they didn't have a lot of money
ashley lived in a poor household
and so ashley convinced her mother that she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else mustard and relish sandwiches
she had heard that condiments like mustard and relish were cheap
and she   she concocted in her own mind at the age of nine that she would convince her mother that that's the only thing she wanted to eat everyday, because she figured that would be a way of saving money for the family and helping them alleviate their hardships
so she did this for a year until her mom got better
and in that round table she told everyone that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too
she had heard me speak about my mother having cancer and having to worry about maybe not getting the health care she needed because of a preexisting condition, and she had connected with that
she thought, maybe barack would fight for my mother
and if he would fight for my mother, then maybe i will fight alongside him
that's what had brought her to florence
so ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign
they all have different stories and different reasons
some bring up specific issues
some talk about, upset about, affirmative action
some talk about, you know, i want to see more jobs in the community
some are frustrated about trade
some just like me
so they all got a bunch of different reasons, and finally, at the end of this discussion, they come to this elderly black man
he's been sitting there quiet the whole time, hasn't been saying a word
and ashley asks him why is he there
and he doesn't bring up a specific issue
he does not say healthcare or the economy
he doesn't talk about the iraq war
he doesn't say anything about education
he doesn't say that he's there because he likes barack obama, or he's proud of the possibility of the first african american president
he simply says to everyone in the room, i am here because of ashley
i am here because of this young girl, and the fact that she's willing to fight for what she believes in
and that reminds me that i still have some fight left in me, and i'm going stand up for what i believe in
now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man, that's not enough to change a country
by itself, it's not enough to give health care to the sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children, but it is where we begin
it's why i believe that the walls in that room began to shake at that moment
and if they can shake in that room, then they can shake here in atlanta, and if they can shake in atlanta, then they can shake in the state of georgia, and if they can shake in georgia, they can shake all across america
and if enough of our voices join together, if we see each other in each other's eyes, we can bring those walls tumbling down
the walls of jericho can finally come tumbling down
that is our hope, but only if we pray together, if we work together, and if we march together
ebenezer, we cannot walk alone
brothers and sisters, we cannot walk alone
in the struggle for justice and for equality, we cannot walk alone
in the struggle for opportunity and justice, we cannot walk alone
in the struggle to heal this nation and repair the world, we cannot walk alone
so i ask you to walk with me and march with me and join your voices with mine, and together we will sing the song that tears down the walls that divide us and lift up an america that is truly indivisible with liberty and justice for all
may god bless the memory of the great pastor of this church
and may god bless the united states of america
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you, new hampshire
i love you back
thank you
thank you
well, thank you so much
i am still fired up and ready to go
thank you
thank you
well, first of all, i want to congratulate senator clinton on a hard-fought victory here in new hampshire
she did an outstanding job
give her a big round of applause
you know, a few weeks ago, no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here tonight in new hampshire
no one could have imagined it
for most of this campaign, we were far behind
we always knew our climb would be steep
but in record numbers, you came out, and you spoke up for change
and with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election, there is something happening in america
there is something happening when men and women in des moines and davenport, in lebanon and concord, come out in the snows of january to wait in lines that stretch block after block because they believe in what this country can be
there is something happening
there's something happening when americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different
there's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to, but the hopes that they hold in common
and whether we are rich or poor, black or white, latino or asian, whether we hail from iowa or new hampshire, nevada or south carolina, we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction
that's what's happening in america right now
change is what's happening in america
you, all of you who are here tonight, all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign, you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness
democrats, independents and republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded washington, who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable, who understand that, if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better, there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill
our new american majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time
we can bring doctors and patients, workers and businesses, democrats and republicans together, and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that, while they get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair, not this time, not now
our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working americans who deserve it
we can stop sending our children to schools with corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success
we can stop talking about how great teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness by giving them more pay and more support
we can do this with our new majority
we can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists, citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return
and when i am president of the united states, we will end this war in iraq and bring our troops home
we will end this war in iraq
we will bring our troops home
we will finish the job   we will finish the job against al qaida in afghanistan
we will care for our veterans
we will restore our moral standing in the world
and we will never use 9/11 as a way to scare up votes, because it is not a tactic to win an election
it is a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the 21st century
terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease
all of the candidates in this race share these goals
all of the candidates in this race have good ideas and all are patriots who serve this country honorably
but the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because it's not just about what i will do as president
it is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the united states of america, can do to change it
that's what this election is all about
that's why tonight belongs to you
it belongs to the organizers, and the volunteers, and the staff who believed in this journey and rallied so many others to join the cause
we know the battle ahead will be long
but always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change
we have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics
and they will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks and months to come
we've been asked to pause for a reality check
we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope
but in the unlikely story that is america, there has never been anything false about hope
for when we have faced down impossible odds, when we've been told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't, generations of americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people
yes we can
yes we can
yes we can
it was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation
yes, we can
it was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights
yes, we can
it was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness
yes, we can
it was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land
yes, we can, to justice and equality
yes we can   to opportunity and prosperity
yes we can heal this nation
yes we can repair this world
yes we can
and so, tomorrow, as we take the campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in las vegas, that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of l
, we will remember that there is something happening in america, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation
and, together, we will begin the next great chapter in the american story, with three words that will ring from coast to coast, from sea to shining sea
yes, we can
thank you, new hampshire
thank you
thank you
thank you, iowa
you know, they said   they said   they said this day would never come
they said our sights were set too high
they said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose
but on this january night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do
you have done what the state of new hampshire can do in five days
you have done what america can do in this new year, 2008
in lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns and in big cities, you came together as democrats, republicans, and independents, to stand up and say that we are one nation
we are one people
and our time for change has come
you said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that's consumed washington
to end the political strategy that's been all about division, and instead make it about addition
to build a coalition for change that stretches through red states and blue states
because that's how we'll win in november, and that's how we'll finally meet the challenges that we face as a nation
we are choosing hope over fear
we're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerful message that change is coming to america
you said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influence speak louder than our voices that they don't own this government   we do
and we are here to take it back
the time has come for a president who will be honest about the choices and the challenges we face, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to know
and in new hampshire, if you give me the same chance that iowa did tonight, i will be that president for america
i'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable and available to every single american, the same way i expanded health care in illinois, by   by bringing democrats and republicans together to get the job done
i'll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working americans who deserve it
i'll be a president who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all
and i'll be a president who ends this war in iraq and finally brings our troops home, who restores our moral standing, who understands that 9/11 is not a way to scare up votes but a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the 21st century   common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease
tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of america because of what you did here in iowa
and so i'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains, the volunteers and the staff who made this all possible
and while i'm at it on thank you's, i think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life, the rock of the obama family, the closer on the campaign trail
give it up for michelle obama
i know you didn't do this for me
you did this   you did this because you believed so deeply in the most american of ideas   that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it
i know this
i know this because while i may be standing here tonight, i'll never forget that my journey began on the streets of chicago doing what so many of you have done for this campaign and all the campaigns here in iowa
organizing and working and fighting to make people's lives just a little bit better
i know how hard it is
it comes with little sleep, little pay, and a lot of sacrifice
there are days of disappointment
but sometimes, just sometimes, there are nights like this
a night   a night that, years from now, when we've made the changes we believe in, when more families can afford to see a doctor, when our children   when malia and sasha and your children inherit a planet that's a little cleaner and safer, when the world sees america differently, and america sees itself as a nation less divided and more united, you'll be able to look back with pride and say that this was the moment when it all began
this was the moment when the improbable beat what washington always said was inevitable
this was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long
when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause
when we finally gave americans who had never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so
this was the moment when we finally beat back the poli of fear and doubt and cynicism, the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up
this was the moment
years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the place where america remembered what it means to hope
for many months, we've been teased, even derided for talking about hope
but we always knew that hope is not blind optimism
it's not ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path
it's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight
hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it
hope is what i saw in the eyes of the young woman in cedar rapids who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill   a young woman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams
hope is what i heard in the voice of the new hampshire woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since her nephew left for iraq   who still goes to bed each night praying for his safe return
hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire, what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation, what led young women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through selma and montgomery for freedom's cause
hope   hope is what led me here today
with a father from kenya, a mother from kansas, and a story that could only happen in the united states of america
hope is the bedrock of this nation   the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, but by us, by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, who have the courage to remake the world as it should be
that is what we started here in iowa and that is the message we can now carry to new hampshire and beyond
the same message we had when we were up and when we were down
the one that can save this country, brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand by calloused hand
that together, ordinary people can do extraordinary things
because we are not a collection of red states and blue states
we are the united states of america
and in this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe again
thank you, iowa
thank you so much
thank you so much
to   to the great governor of iowa and lieutenant governor of iowa
to my dear friend tom harkin for the outstanding work that he does
to the congressional delegation of iowa that is doing outstanding work
and to nancy pelosi, madam speaker, thank you all for the wonderful welcome and the wonderful hospitality
i love you back
a little less than one year from today, you will go into the voting booth and you will select the president of the united states of america
now, here's the good news   the name george w
bush will not be on the ballot
the name of my cousin dick cheney will not be on the ballot
we've been trying to hide that for a long time
everybody has a black sheep in the family
the era of scooter libby justice, and brownie incompetence, and karl rove politics will finally be over
but the question you're going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in january and you vote in november is, what's next for america
we are in a defining moment in our history
our nation is at war
the planet is in peril
the dream that so many generations fought for feels as if it's slowly slipping away
we are working harder for less
we've never paid more for health care or for college
it's harder to save and it's harder to retire
and most of all we've lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it
we were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was katrina and wiretaps
we were promised a uniter, and we got a president who could not even lead the half of the country that voted for him
we were promised a more ethical and more efficient government, and instead we have a town called washington that is more corrupt and more wasteful than it was before
and the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood to take this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged
it is because of these failures that america is listening, intently, to what we say here today   not just democrats, but republicans and independents who've lost trust in their government, but want to believe again
and it is because of these failures that we not only have a moment of great challenge, but also a moment of great opportunity
we have a chance to bring the country together in a new majority   to finally tackle problems that george bush made far worse, but that had festered long before george bush ever took office   problems that we've talked about year after year after year after year
and that is why the same old washington textbook campaigns just won't do in this election
that's why not answering questions ‘cause we are afraid our answers won't be popular just won't do
that's why telling the american people what we think they want to hear instead of telling the american people what they need to hear just won't do
triangulating and poll-driven positions because we're worried about what mitt or rudy might say about us just won't do
if we are really serious about wining this election democrats, we can't live in fear of losing it
this party   the party of jefferson and jackson, of roosevelt and kennedy   has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the american people when we led, not by polls, but by principle
not by calculation, but by conviction
when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose   a higher purpose
and i run for the presidency of the united states of america because that's the party america needs us to be right now
a party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership
a party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should
a party that doesn't just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change   change that america can believe in
that's why i'm in this race
that's why i am running for the presidency of the united states of america   to offer change that we can believe in
i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over
i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists   and won
they have not funded my campaign, they will not get a job in my white house, and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president
i'm in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseas and put them in the pockets of hard working americans who deserve it
and i won't raise the minimum wage every ten years   i will raise it to keep pace so that workers don't' fall behind
that is why i am in it
to protect the american worker
to fight for the american worker
i'm in this race because i want to stop talking about the outrage of 47 million americans without health care and start actually doing something about it
i expanded health care in illinois by bringing democrats and republicans together
by taking on the insurance industry
and that is how i will make certain that every single american in this country has health care they can count on and i won't do it twenty years from now, i won't do it ten years from now, i will do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states of america
i run for president to make sure that every american child has the best education that we have to offer   from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college
and i won't just talk about how great teachers are   as president i will reward them for their greatness   by raising salaries and giving them more support
that's why i'm in this race
i am running for president because i am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the only way to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting like george bush republicans
when i am this party's nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that i voted for the war in iraq
or that i gave george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran
or that i supported bush-cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we don't like
and he will not be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for america to torture   because it is never ok
that's why i am in it
as president, i will end the war in iraq
we will have our troops home in sixteen months
i will close guantanamo
i will restore habeas corpus
i will finish the fight against al qaeda
and i will lead the world to combat the common threats of the 21st century   nuclear weapons and terrorism
climate change and poverty
genocide and disease
and i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, you matter to us
your future is our future
and our moment is now
america, our moment is now
our moment is now
i don't want to spend the next year or the next four years re-fighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s
i don't want to pit red america against blue america, i want to be the president of the united states of america
and if those republicans come at me with the same fear-mongering and swift-boating that they usually do, then i will take them head on
because i believe the american people are tired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions
we can make this election not about fear, but about the future
and that won't just be a democratic victory
that will be an american victory
and that is a victory america needs right now
i am not in this race to fulfill some long-held ambitions or because i believe it's somehow owed to me
i never expected to be here, i always knew this journey was improbable
i've never been on a journey that wasn't
i am running in this race because of what dr
king called the fierce urgency of now
because i believe that there's such a thing as being too late
and that hour is almost upon us
i don't want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of americans still lack health care because we couldn't take on the insurance industry
i don't want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches
the planet has reached a point of no return because we couldn't find a way to stop buying oil from dictators
i don't want to see more american lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or the courage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight
i don't want to see homeless veterans on the streets
i don't want to send another generation of american children to failing schools
i don't want that future for my daughters
i don't want that future for your sons
i do not want that future for america
i'm in this race for the same reason that i fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for the hopeless on the streets of chicago
for the same reason i fought for justice and equality as a civil rights lawyer
for the same reason that i fought for illinois families for over a decade
because i will never forget that the only reason that i'm standing here today is because somebody, somewhere stood up for me when it was risky
stood up when it was hard
stood up when it wasn't popular
and because that somebody stood up, a few more stood up
and then a few thousand stood up
and then a few million stood up
and standing up, with courage and clear purpose, they somehow managed to change the world
that's why i'm running, iowa   to give our children and grandchildren the same chances somebody gave me
that's why i'm running, democrats   to keep the american dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity, who still thirst for equality
that's why i'm asking you to stand with me, that's why i'm asking you to caucus for me, that's why i am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept
in this election   in this moment   let us reach for what we know is possible
a nation healed
a world repaired
an america that believes again
thank you very much everybody
thank you very much, mr
president
president, on thursdays senator durbin and i hold a constituent coffee so we can hear from the folks back home
a young man came a few months ago who was about 25, 26 years old
he had been in iraq for a year   the first   he had been back from iraq for a year
the first six months of that year had been spent in a coma
an explosion had shattered his face, blinded him in both eyes, has left him without the use of one arm
he talked to us about how he was going through rehab
he introduced us to his family
he has a wife and two young daughters like i do, and his wife talked for a bit about the adjustments they were making at home since dad got hurt
and i found myself looking at not just him, but his wife, who loves him so much
and i thought about how their lives were forever changed because of the decision that was carried out four years ago
the sacrifices of war are immeasurable
i first made this point in the fall of 2002, at the end of the speech that i gave opposing the invasion of iraq
i said then that i certainly do not oppose all wars
rather, i oppose dumb wars, rash wars, wars that are based on passion as opposed to wars based on a sober assessment of our national security interests, because there's no decision more profound than the one we make to send our brave men and women into harm's way
i've thought about these words from time to time since that speech, but never so much as the day i saw that young man and his wife, and understood the degree to which their lives had been turn upside down
the sacrifices of war are immeasurable
too many have returned from iraq with that soldier's story   with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not heal
too many of our best have come home shrouded in the flag they loved
too many moms and dads and husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that's hardest for any loved one to hear
and the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories and dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of a brutal civil war that goes on and on and on to this day
the sacrifices of war, mr
president, are immeasurable
it was not impossible to see back then that we might arrive at the place we're at today
i said then that a war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics would lead to a u
occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences
i believed that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale or strong international support would only strengthen the recruitment arm of al-qaeda and erode the good standing and moral authority that took our country generations to build
there were other experts and leaders and everyday americans who believed this too
i wish i had been wrong
i wish we weren't here talking about this at the beginning of the war's fifth year   because the consequences of this war have been profound
and the sacrifices have been immeasurable
president, those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the american people
but the american people have been extraordinarily resolved
they've seen their sons and daughters killed and wounded on the streets of fallujah
they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort   money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland and our competitive standing as a nation
it is not a failure of resolve that has led us into this chaos but a failed strategy   a strategy that has only strengthened iran's strategic position, increased threats posed by terrorist organizations, reduced u
credibility and influence around the world, and placed israel and other nations  to the united states in the region in greater peril
iraq has not been a failure of resolve
it has been a failure of strategy   and that strategy must change
it is time to bring a responsible end to u
involvement in this conflict is now
it's become apparent, mr
president, that there's no military solution to this war
no amount of u
soldiers   not 10,000 more, not 20,000 more, not almost 30,000 more than we know   that we know we are sending   can solve the grievances that lay at the heart of someone else's civil war
our troops cannot serve as their diplomats, and we can no longer referee their civil war
we must begin a phased withdrawal of our forces starting may 1st, with the goal of removing all combat forces by march 30th, 2008
we also must make sure that we're not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in, and that's why this withdrawal should be gradual, and maintain some u
troops in the region to prevent a wider war in the region, while they can also work on going after al qaeda and other terrorists
but this phased withdrawal, mr
president, must begin soon
letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the iraqis to take ownership of their country and bring an end to their conflict
it is time for our troops to start coming home
history will not judge, mr
president, the architects of this war kindly
but the books have yet to be written on our effort to right the wrongs we see in iraq
the story has yet to be told about how we turned from this moment, found our way out of the desert, and took to heart the lessons of war that too many refused to heed back then
for it is of little use or comfort to recall past advice and warnings if we do not allow them to guide us in the challenges that lie ahead
president, threats loom large in an age where terrorist networks thrive, and there will certainly be times when we have to call on our brave servicemen and women to risk their lives again
but before we make that most profound of all decisions, before we send our best off to battle, we must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow
we must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy
we must not embark on a war based on untested theories, political agendas, or wishful thinking that has basis   that has little basis in fact or reality
we must focus our efforts on the threats we know exist, and we must evaluate those threats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political reasons
president, we must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense
it is a choice we sometimes have to make, but one  must be made rarely and always reluctantly
that's because america's standing in the world is a precious resource not easily rebuilt
we value the cooperation and goodwill of other nations not because it makes us feel good, but because it makes all the world safer
because the only way to battle 21st century threats that race across the borders   threats like terror and disease and nuclear proliferation   is to enlist the resources and support of all nations
to win our wider struggle, we must let people across this planet know that there is another, more hopeful alternative to the hateful ideologies the terrorists espouse   and renewed   and a renewed america will reflect and champion that vision
president, we must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war
iraq was not just a failure of conception but a failure of execution, and so when a conflict does arise that requires our involvement, we must understand that country's history, its politics, its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil
we must understand that setting up ballot boxes does not a democracy make   that real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force, and a legitimate government, and ensuring that people have food, and water, and electricity, and basic services
and we must be honest about how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people themselves
finally, mr
president, we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women to war, we make sure we give them the training they need, and the equipment that will keep them safe, and a mission that they can accomplish
we must respect our commanders' advice not just when its politically convenient, but even when it's not what we want to hear
and when our troops come home, it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they come home to the services, and the benefits, and the care they deserve
as we stand at the beginning of the fifth year of this war, mr
president, let us remember   let us remember that young man from illinois, and his wife, and his daughters, and the thousands upon thousands of families who are living the very real consequences and immeasurable sacrifices that have come from our decision to invade iraq
we are so blessed in this country to have so many men and women like this   americans willing to put on that uniform, and say the hard goodbyes, and risk their lives in a far off land because they know that such consequences and sacrifices are sometimes necessary to defend our country and achieve a lasting peace
that is why we have no greater responsibility than to ensure the decision to place them in harm's way is the right one
and that is why we must learn the lessons of iraq
it is what we owe our soldiers
it is what we owe their families
and it is what we owe our country   now, and all the days and months to come
thank you, mr
president
i yield the floor
president, i rise, first, to offer strong words of support for the statement that was just offered by the distinguished senator from massachusetts
i, as well, rise today to speak in support of the iraq resolution that the senate will consider tomorrow
president, the news from iraq is very bad
last week, a suicide bomber stood outside a bookstore and killed 20 people
other attacks killed 118 shia pilgrims
on sunday, a car bomb went off in central baghdad, and more than 30 people died
and the road from the airport into baghdad is littered with smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and the memories of our sons and daughters
president, the civil war in iraq rages on
the insurgents have started to change their tactics
they hide in buildings and along the streets and wait for our helicopters
they've shot down at least eight u
helicopters in the last month
more of our soldiers are dying and coming home with their bodies broken and their nerves shattered at a va system completely unprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives
president, it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve
the american people have been extraordinarily resolved
they've seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of fallujah
they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort   money that they know could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation
the failure has not been a failure of resolve
that's not what's led us into chaos
it's been a failure of strategy
and it's time that the strategy change
there is no military solution, mr
president, to the civil war that rages on in iraq
and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solution becomes possible
the news from iraq is very bad, and it's been that way for at least four years
we all wish the   that the land the president and the vice president speak of exists
we wish that there was an iraq where the insurgency was in the last throes, where the people work with security, where children play outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky
we wish for those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about in the news, to what we've experienced these long four years
i repeat, mr
president, there is no military solution to this war
at this point, no amount of soldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone else's civil war
the iraqi people   shia, sunni, and kurd   must come to the table and reach a political settlement themselves
if they want peace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it
our failed strategy in iraq has strengthened iran's strategic position, reduced u
credibility and influence around the world, placed israel and other nations friendly to the united states in the region in greater peril
these are not the signs of a well-laid plan
it's time for a profound change
this is what we're trying to do here today
we're saying it is time to start making plans to redeploy our troops so that they can focus on the wider struggle against terrorism, win the war in afghanistan, strengthen our position in the middle east, and pressure the iraqis to reach a political settlement
even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to accomplish what the american people asked for last november
i'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus
and i want to commend senator reid for his efforts
he took the time to listen   so many of us from both chambers of congress could help develop this plan
the decision in particular to begin a phased redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all our combat forces by march 31st, 2008, is the right step
it's a measure the iraq study group spoke of, an idea i borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill i introduced, now has more than 60 cosponsors from house and senate and from both sides of the aisle
they've supported this plan since i announced a similar plan in january
the decision allows some u
forces to remain in iraq with a clear mission to protect u
and coalition personnel, conduct counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip iraqi forces
and that is a smart decision
president al-maliki spoke at a conference and warned that the violence in iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked
by maintaining a strong presence in iraq and the middle east, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, we can ensure that the chaos does not spread
i should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment within 120 days is a practical one
our military options have been exhausted
it's time to seek a political solution to this war, and with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they need to arrive at an accommodation
president, while i strongly believe that this war never should have been authorized, i believe we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless getting in
while i prefer my approach, as reflected in my bill, i believe that this new resolution does begin to point u
policy in iraq and the region in the right direction
an end to the war, and achieving a political solution to iraq's civil war, will not happen unless we demand it
peace with stability doesn't just happen because we wish for it
it comes when we never give in and never give up and never tire of working towards a life on earth worthy of our human dignity
the decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads   a moment of great peril, mr
president
we have a choice
we can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility and damaged our strategic interests in the region or we can turn toward the future
the road won't be smooth, and i have to say, mr
president, that there will be risks with any approach
but this approach is our last best hope to end this war so we can begin to bring our troops home and begin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the threats that we face
the president has said he will continue down the road towards more troops and more of the same failed policies
the president sought and won authorization from congress to wage this war from the start
but he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the american people, that is tired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount
president, the news from iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this chamber say enough
let this day be the day that begins the painful and difficult work of moving from this crossroad
let this be the day that we begin pulling towards the future with a responsible conclusion to this painful chapter in our nation's history
president, let this be the day when we finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored
thank you, mr
president
i yield the floor
thank you
giving all praise and honor to god for bringing us here today
i must begin because at the unity breakfast this morning i was saving for last and the list was so long i left him out after that introduction
so i'm going to start by saying how much i appreciate the friendship and the support and the outstanding work that he does each and every day, not just in capitol hill but also back here in the district
please give a warm round of applause for your congressman artur davis
it is a great honor to be here
reverend jackson, thank you so much
to the family of brown a
e, to the good bishop kirkland, thank you for your wonderful message and your leadership
i want to acknowledge one of the great heroes of american history and american life, somebody who captures the essence of decency and courage, somebody who i have admired all my life and were it not for him, i'm not sure i'd be here today, congressman john lewis
i'm thankful to him
to all the distinguished guests and clergy, i'm not sure i'm going to thank reverend lowery because he stole the show
i was mentioning earlier, i know we've got c
vivian in the audience, and when you have to speak in front of somebody who martin luther king said was the greatest preacher he ever heard, then you've got some problems
and i'm a little nervous about following so many great preachers
but i'm hoping that the spirit moves me and to all my colleagues who have given me such a warm welcome, thank you very much for allowing me to speak to you here today
you know, several weeks ago, after i had announced that i was running for the presidency of the united states, i stood in front of the old state capitol in springfield, illinois
where abraham lincoln delivered his speech declaring, drawing in scripture, that a house divided against itself could not stand
and i stood and i announced that i was running for the presidency
and there were a lot of commentators, as they are prone to do, who questioned the audacity of a young man like myself, haven't been in washington too long
and i acknowledge that there is a certain presumptuousness about this
but i got a letter from a friend of some of yours named reverend otis moss jr
in cleveland, and his son, otis moss iii is the pastor at my church and i must send greetings from dr
jeremiah a
wright jr
but i got a letter giving me encouragement and saying how proud he was that i had announced and encouraging me to stay true to my ideals and my values and not to be fearful
and he said, if there's some folks out there who are questioning whether or not you should run, just tell them to look at the story of joshua because you're part of the joshua generation
so i just want to talk a little about moses and aaron and joshua, because we are in the presence today of a lot of moseses
we're in the presence today of giants whose shoulders we stand on, people who battled, not just on behalf of african americans but on behalf of all of america
that battled for america's soul, that shed blood , that endured taunts and formant and in some cases gave   torment and in some cases gave the full measure of their devotion
like moses, they challenged pharaoh, the princes, powers who said that some are atop and others are at the bottom, and that's how it's always going to be
there were people like anna cooper and marie foster and jimmy lee jackson and maurice olette, c
vivian, reverend lowery, john lewis, who said we can imagine something different and we know there is something out there for us, too
thank god, he's made us in his image and we reject the notion that we will for the rest of our lives be confined to a station of inferiority, that we can't aspire to the highest of heights, that our talents can't be expressed to their fullest
and so because of what they endured, because of what they marched
they led a people out of bondage
they took them across the sea that folks thought could not be parted
they wandered through a desert but always knowing that god was with them and that, if they maintained that trust in god, that they would be all right
and it's because they marched that the next generation hasn't been bloodied so much
it's because they marched that we elected councilmen, congressmen
it is because they marched that we have artur davis and keith ellison
it is because they marched that i got the kind of education i got, a law degree, a seat in the illinois senate and ultimately in the united states senate
it is because they marched that i stand before you here today
i was mentioning at the unity breakfast this morning, my   at the unity breakfast this morning that my debt is even greater than that because not only is my career the result of the work of the men and women who we honor here today
my very existence might not have been possible had it not been for some of the folks here today
i mentioned at the unity breakfast that a lot of people been asking, well, you know, your father was from africa, your mother, she's a white woman from kansas
i'm not sure that you have the same experience
and i tried to explain, you don't understand
you see, my grandfather was a cook to the british in kenya
grew up in a small village and all his life, that's all he was   a cook and a house boy
and that's what they called him, even when he was 60 years old
they called him a house boy
they wouldn't call him by his last name
sound familiar
he had to carry a passbook around because africans in their own land, in their own country, at that time, because it was a british colony, could not move about freely
they could only go where they were told to go
they could only work where they were told to work
yet something happened back here in selma, alabama
something happened in birmingham that sent out what bobby kennedy called, ripples of hope all around the world
something happened when a bunch of women decided they were going to walk instead of ride the bus after a long day of doing somebody else's laundry, looking after somebody else's children
when men who had phd's decided that's enough and we're going to stand up for our dignity
that sent a shout across oceans so that my grandfather began to imagine something different for his son
his son, who grew up herding goats in a small village in africa could suddenly set his sights a little higher and believe that maybe a black man in this world had a chance
what happened in selma, alabama and birmingham also stirred the conscience of the nation
it worried folks in the white house who said, you know, we're battling communism
how are we going to win hearts and minds all across the world
if right here in our own country, john, we're not observing the ideals set fort in our constitution, we might be accused of being hypocrites
so the kennedy's decided we're going to do an air lift
we're going to go to africa and start bringing young africans over to this country and give them scholarships to study so they can learn what a wonderful country america is
this young man named barack obama got one of those tickets and came over to this country
he met this woman whose great great-great-great-grandfather had owned slaves
but she had a good idea there was some craziness going on because they looked at each other and they decided that we know that the world as it has been it might not be possible for us to get together and have a child
there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma, alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge
so they got together and barack obama jr
was born
so don't tell me i don't have a claim on selma, alabama
don't tell me i'm not coming home to selma, alabama
i'm here because somebody marched
i'm here because you all sacrificed for me
i stand on the shoulders of giants
i thank the moses generation
but we've got to remember, now, that joshua still had a job to do
as great as moses was, despite all that he did, leading a people out of bondage, he didn't cross over the river to see the promised land
god told him your job is done
you'll see it
you'll be at the mountain top and you can see what i've promised
what i've promised to abraham and isaac and jacob
you will see that i've fulfilled that promise but you won't go there
we're going to leave it to the joshua generation to make sure it happens
there are still battles that need to be fought
some rivers that need to be crossed
like moses, the task was passed on to those who might not have been as deserving, might not have been as courageous, find themselves in front of the risks that their parents and grandparents and great grandparents had taken
that doesn't mean that they don't still have a burden to shoulder, that they don't have some responsibilities
the previous generation, the moses generation, pointed the way
they took us 90% of the way there
we still got that 10% in order to cross over to the other side
so the question, i guess, that i have today is what's called of us in this joshua generation
what do we do in order to fulfill that legacy
to fulfill the obligations and the debt that we owe to those who allowed us to be here today
now, i don't think we could ever fully repay that debt
i think that we're always going to be looking back, but there are at least a few suggestions that i would have in terms of how we might fulfill that enormous legacy
the first is to recognize our history
john lewis talked about why we're here today
but i worry sometimes   we've got black history month, we come down and march every year, once a year
we occasionally celebrate the various events of the civil rights movement, we celebrate dr
king's birthday, but it strikes me that understanding our history and knowing what it means, is an everyday activity
moses told the joshua generation
don't forget where you came from
i worry sometimes, that the joshua generation in its success forgets where it came from
thinks it doesn't have to make as many sacrifices
thinks that the very height of ambition is to make as much money as you can, to drive the biggest car and have the biggest house and wear a rolex watch and get your own private jet, get some of that oprah money
and i think that's a good thing
there's nothing wrong with making money, but if you know your history, then you know that there is a certain poverty of ambition involved in simply striving just for money
materialism alone will not fulfill the possibilities of your existence
you have to fill that with something else
you have to fill it with the golden rule
you've got to fill it with thinking about others
and if we know our history, then we will understand that that is the highest mark of service
second thing that the joshua generation needs to understand is that the principles of equality that were set fort and were battled for have to be fought each and every day
it is not a one-time thing
i was remarking at the unity breakfast on the fact that the single most significant concern that this justice department under this administration has had with respect to discrimination has to do with affirmative action
that they have basically spent all their time worrying about colleges and universities around the country that are given a little break to young african americans and hispanics to make sure that they can go to college, too
i had a school in southern illinois that set up a program for phd's in math and science for african americans
and the reason they had set it up is because we only had less than 1% of the phd's in science and math go to african americans
at a time when we are competing in a global economy, when we're not competing just against folks in north carolina or florida or california, we're competing against folks in china and india and we need math and science majors, this university thought this might be a nice thing to do
and the justice department wrote them a letter saying we are going to threaten to sue you for reverse discrimination unless you cease this program
and it reminds us that we still got a lot of work to do, and that the basic enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, the injustice that still exists within our criminal justice system, the disparity in terms of how people are treated in this country continues
it has gotten better
and we should never deny that it's gotten better
but we shouldn't forget that better is not good enough
that until we have absolute equality in this country in terms of people being treated on the basis of their color or their gender, that that is something that we've got to continue to work on and the joshua generation has a significant task in making that happen
third thing   we've got to recognize that we fought for civil rights, but we've still got a lot of economic rights that have to be dealt with
we've got 46 million people uninsured in this country despite spending more money on health care than any nation on earth
it makes no sense
as a consequence, we've got what's known as a health care disparity in this nation because many of the uninsured are african american or latino
life expectancy is lower
almost every disease is higher within minority communities
the health care gap
blacks are less likely in their schools to have adequate funding
we have less-qualified teachers in those schools
we have fewer textbooks in those schools
we got in some schools rats outnumbering computers
that's called the achievement gap
you've got a health care gap and you've got an achievement gap
you've got katrina still undone
i went down to new orleans three weeks ago
it still looks bombed out
still not rebuilt
when 9/11 happened, the federal government had a special program of grants to help rebuild
they waived any requirement that manhattan would have to pay 10% of the cost of rebuilding
when hurricane andrew happened in florida, 10% requirement, they waived it because they understood that some disasters are so devastating that we can't expect a community to rebuild
new orleans   the largest national catastrophe in our history, the federal government says where's your 10%
there is an empathy gap
there is a gap in terms of sympathizing for the folks in new orleans
it's not a gap that the american people felt because we saw how they responded
but somehow our government didn't respond with that same sense of compassion, with that same sense of kindness
and here is the worst part, the tragedy in new orleans happened well before the hurricane struck because many of those communities, there were so many young men in prison, so many kids dropping out, so little hope
a hope gap
a hope gap that still pervades too many communities all across the country and right here in alabama
so the question is, then, what are we, the joshua generation, doing to close those gaps
are we doing every single thing that we can do in congress in order to make sure that early education is adequately funded and making sure that we are raising the minimum wage so people can have dignity and respect
are we ensuring that, if somebody loses a job, that they're getting retrained
and that, if they've lost their health care and pension, somebody is there to help them get back on their feet
are we making sure we're giving a second chance to those who have strayed and gone to prison but want to start a new life
government alone can't solve all those problems, but government can help
it's the responsibility of the joshua generation to make sure that we have a government that is as responsive as the need that exists all across america
that brings me to one other point, about the joshua generation, and that is this   that it's not enough just to ask what the government can do for us  it's important for us to ask what we can do for ourselves
one of the signature aspects of the civil rights movement was the degree of discipline and fortitude that was instilled in all the people who participated
imagine young people, 16, 17, 20, 21, backs straight, eyes clear, suit and tie, sitting down at a lunch counter knowing somebody is going to spill milk on you but you have the discipline to understand that you are not going to retaliate because in showing the world how disciplined we were as a people, we were able to win over the conscience of the nation
i can't say for certain that we have instilled that same sense of moral clarity and purpose in this generation
bishop, sometimes i feel like we've lost it a little bit
i'm fighting to make sure that our schools are adequately funded all across the country
with the inequities of relying on property taxes and people who are born in wealthy districts getting better schools than folks born in poor districts and that's now how it's supposed to be
that's not the american way
but i'll tell you what   even as i fight on behalf of more education funding, more equity, i have to also say that , if parents don't turn off the television set when the child comes home from school and make sure they sit down and do their homework and go talk to the teachers and find out how they're doing, and if we don't start instilling a sense in our young children that there is nothing to be ashamed about in educational achievement, i don't know who taught them that reading and writing and conjugating your verbs was something white
we've got to get over that mentality
that is part of what the moses generation teaches us, not saying to ourselves we can't do something, but telling ourselves that we can achieve
we can do that
we got power in our hands
folks are complaining about the quality of our government, i understand there's something to be complaining about
i'm in washington
i see what's going on
i see those powers and principalities have snuck back in there, that they're writing the energy bills and the drug laws
we understand that, but i'll tell you what
i also know that, if cousin pookie would vote, get off the couch and register some folks and go to the polls, we might have a different kind of politics
that's what the moses generation teaches us
take off your bedroom slippers
put on your marching shoes
go do some politics
change this country
that's what we need
we have too many children in poverty in this country and everybody should be ashamed, but don't tell me it doesn't have a little to do with the fact that we got too many daddies not acting like daddies
don't think that fatherhood ends at conception
i know something about that because my father wasn't around when i was young and i struggled
those of you who read my book know
i went through some difficult times
i know what it means when you don't have a strong male figure in the house, which is why the hardest thing about me being in politics sometimes is not being home as much as i'd like and i'm just blessed that i've got such a wonderful wife at home to hold things together
don't tell me that we can't do better by our children, that we can't take more responsibility for making sure we're instilling in them the values and the ideals that the moses generation taught us about sacrifice and dignity and honesty and hard work and discipline and self-sacrifice
that comes from us
we've got to transmit that to the next generation and i guess the point that i'm making is that the civil rights movement wasn't just a fight against the oppressor
it was also a fight against the oppressor in each of us
sometimes it's easy to just point at somebody else and say it's their fault, but oppression has a way of creeping into it
reverend, it has a way of stunting yourself
you start telling yourself, bishop, i can't do something
i can't read
i can't go to college
i can't start a business
i can't run for congress
i can't run for the presidency
people start telling you  you can't do something, after a while, you start believing it and part of what the civil rights movement was about was recognizing that we have to transform ourselves in order to transform the world
mahatma gandhi, great hero of dr
king and the person who helped create the nonviolent movement around the world
he once said that you can't change the world if you haven't changed
if you want to change the world, the change has to happen with you first and that is something that the greatest and most honorable of generations has taught us, but the final thing that i think the moses generation teaches us is to remind ourselves that we do what we do because god is with us
you know, when moses was first called to lead people out of the promised land, he said i don't think i can do it, lord
i don't speak like reverend lowery
i don't feel brave and courageous and the lord said i will be with you
throw down that rod
pick it back up
i'll show you what to do
the same thing happened with the joshua generation
joshua said, you know, i'm scared
i'm not sure that i am up to the challenge, the lord said to him, every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, i have given you
be strong and have courage, for i am with you wherever you go
be strong and have courage
it's a prayer for a journey
a prayer that kept a woman in her seat when the bus driver told her to get up, a prayer that led nine children through the doors of the little rock school, a prayer that carried our brothers and sisters over a bridge right here in selma, alabama
be strong and have courage
when you see row and row of state trooper facing you, the horses and the tear gas, how else can you walk
towards them, unarmed, unafraid
when they come start beating your friends and neighbors, how else can you simply kneel down, bow your head and ask the lord for salvation
when you see heads gashed open and eyes burning and children lying hurt on the side of the road, when you are john lewis and you've been beaten within an inch of your life on sunday, how do you wake up monday and keep on marching
be strong and have courage, for i am with you wherever you go
we've come a long way in this journey, but we still have a long way to travel
we traveled because god was with us
it's not how far we've come
that bridge outside was crossed by blacks and whites, northerners and southerners, teenagers and children, the beloved community of god's children, they wanted to take those steps together, but it was left to the joshua's to finish the journey moses had begun and today we're called to be the joshua's of our time, to be the generation that finds our way across this river
there will be days when the water seems wide and the journey too far, but in those moments, we must remember that throughout our history, there has been a running thread of ideals that have guided our travels and pushed us forward, even when they're just beyond our reach, liberty in the face of tyranny, opportunity where there was none and hope over the most crushing despair
those ideals and values beckon us still and when we have our doubts and our fears, just like joshua did, when the road looks too long and it seems like we may lose our way, remember what these people did on that bridge
keep in your heart the prayer of that journey, the prayer that god gave to joshua
be strong and have courage in the face of injustice
be strong and have courage in the face of prejudice and hatred, in the face of joblessness and helplessness and hopelessness
be strong and have courage, brothers and sisters, those who are gathered here today, in the face of our doubts and fears, in the face of skepticism, in the face of cynicism, in the face of a mighty river
be strong and have courage and let us cross over that promised land together
thank you so much everybody
god bless you
hello springfield
look at all of you
look at all of you
goodness
thank you so much
thank you so much
giving all praise and honor to god for bringing us here today
thank you so much
i am   i am so grateful to see all of you
you guys are still cheering back there
let me   let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today
i know it's a little chilly   but i'm fired up
you know, we all made this journey for a reason
it's humbling to see a crowd like this, but in my heart i know you didn't just come here for me
you
came here because you believe in what this country can be
in the face of war, you believe there can be peace
in the face of despair, you believe there can be hope
in the face of a politics that shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe that we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union
that's the journey we're on today
but let me tell you how i came to be here
as most of you know, i'm not a native of this great state
i   i moved to illinois over two decades ago
i was a young man then, just a year out of college
i knew no one in chicago when i arrived, was without money or family connections
but a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for the grand sum of 13,000 dollars a year
and i accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea
that i might play a small part in building a better america
my work took me to some of chicago's poorest neighborhoods
i joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings
i saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature, that the decisions to close a steel mill was made by distant executives, that the lack of textbooks and computers in a school could be traced to skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away, and that when a child turns to violence   i came to realize that   there's a hole in that boy's heart that no government alone can fill
it was in these neighborhoods that i received the best education that i ever had, and where i learned the meaning of my christian faith
after three years of this work, i went to law school, because i wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need
i became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, i came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate
it was with these ideas in mind that i arrived in this capital city as a state senator
it   it was here, in springfield, where i saw all that is america converge   farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard
i made lasting friendships here, friends that i see here in the audience today
it was here   it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable
that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised
and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
that's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken
that's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need
that's why we made the tax system right here in springfield more fair and just for working families
and that's why we passed ethics reform that the cynics said could never, ever be passed
it was here, in springfield, where north, south, east, and west come together that i was reminded of the essential decency of the american people   where i came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful america
and that is why, in the shadow of the old state capitol, where lincoln once called on a house divided to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still live, i stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the united states of america
now   now, listen, i   i
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
look, i   i
recognize that there is a certain presumptuousness in this, a certain audacity, to this announcement
i know that i haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington
but i've been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change
the genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed
and we should take heart, because we've changed this country before
in the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an empire to its knees
in the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free
in the face of depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty
we welcomed immigrants to our shores
we opened railroads to the west
we landed a man on the moon
and we heard a king's call to let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream
we've done this before
each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done
today we are called once more, and it is time for our generation to answer that call
for that is our unyielding faith   that in   in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it
that's what abraham lincoln understood
he had his doubts
he had his defeats
he had his skeptics
he had his setbacks
but through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people
it's because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we're no longer divided, north and south, slave and free
it's because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people   as americans
all of us know what those challenges are today
a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can
we know the challenges
we've heard them
we've talked about them for years
what's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans
what's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness   the smallness of our politics   the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle the big problems of america
for the past six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter
we've been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion
we've been told that climate change is a hoax
we've been told that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight
and when all else fails, when katrina happens, or the death toll in iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault
we're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants
and as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void
the cynics, the lobbyists, the special interests   who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play
they write the checks and you get stuck with the bill
they get the access while you get to write a letter
they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back
the time for that kind of politics is over
it is through
it's time to turn the page   right here and right now
now look
okay
alright
thank you
thank you
thank you
look, look, we have made some progress already
i was proud to help lead the fight in congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reforms since watergate
but washington has a long way to go, and it won't be easy
that's why we'll have to set priorities
we'll have to make hard choices
and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes that we need, more money and programs alone will not get us to where we need to go
each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility   for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice
so let us begin
let us begin this hard work together
let us transform this nation
let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age
let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed
let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability
let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america
we can do that
and as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity
let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised
let's make it possible for hardworking americans to save for retirement
let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again
we can do that
let's be the generation that ends poverty in america
every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids can have a safe place to go when they work
we can do this
and let's be the generation that finally, after all these years, tackles our health care crisis
we can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy
let's be the generation that says right here, right now
we will have universal health care in america by the end of the next president's first term
we can do that
let's be the generation that finally frees america from the tyranny of oil
we can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars
we can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases
we can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world
let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here
most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that september day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got
politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore
we can work together to keep our country safe
i've worked with the republican senator dick lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest weapons
we can work together to track down terrorists with a stronger military
we can tighten the net around their finances
we can improve our intelligence capabilities and finally get homeland security right
but let's also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will only come by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions of people around the globe
we can do those things
but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq
most of you know   most of you know that i opposed this war from the start
i thought it was a tragic mistake
today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been
america, it is time to start bringing our troops home
it's time   it's time to admit that no amount of american lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war
that's why i have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by march of 2008
let the iraqis know   letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the sunni and shia to come to the table and find peace
and there's one other thing that it's not too late to get right about this war, and that is the homecoming of the men and women, our veterans, who have sacrificed the most
let us honor their courage by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love
let us be the generation that begins that work
i know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things
i understand the skepticism
after all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and i expect this year will be no different
all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches
all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead this country
but too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own
that's why this campaign can't only be about me
it must be about us
it must be about what we can do together
this campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams
it will take your time, your energy, and your advice to push us forward when we're doing right, and let us know when we're not
this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
by ourselves, this change will not happen
divided, we are bound to fail
but the life of a tall, gangly, self-made springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible
he tells us that there is power in words
he tells us that there's power in conviction
that beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people
he tells us that there's power in hope
as lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say this
of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through
that is our purpose here today
that is why i am in this race   not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation
i want   i want to win that next battle   for justice and opportunity
i want to win that next battle   for better schools, and better jobs, and better health care for all
i want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better america
and if you will join with me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as i see, the future of endless possibility stretching out before us
if you sense, as i sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fears, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then i am ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you   today
together we can finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth
thank you very much everybody   let's get to work
i love you
thank you
as many of you know, over the last few months i've been thinking hard about my plans for 2008
running for the presidency is a profound decision   a decision no one should make on the basis of media hype or personal ambition alone   and so before i committed myself and my family to this race, i wanted to be sure that this was right for us and, more importantly, right for the country
i certainly didn't expect to find myself in this position a year ago
but as i've spoken to many of you in my travels across the states these past months, as i've read your emails and read your letters, i've been struck by how hungry we all are for a different kind of politics
so i've spent some time thinking about how i could best advance the cause of change and progress that we so desperately need
the decisions that have been made in washington these past six years, and the problems that have been ignored, have put our country in a precarious place
our economy is changing rapidly, and that means profound changes for working people
many of you have shared with me your stories about skyrocketing health care bills, the pensions you've lost and your struggles to pay for college for your kids
our continued dependence on oil has put our security and our very planet at risk
and we're still mired in a tragic and costly war that should have never been waged
but challenging as they are, it's not the magnitude of our problems that concerns me the most
it's the smallness of our politics
america's faced big problems before
but today, our leaders in washington seem incapable of working together in a practical, common sense way
politics has become so bitter and partisan, so gummed up by money and influence, that we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions
and that's what we have to change first
we have to change our politics, and come together around our common interests and concerns as americans
this won't happen by itself
a change in our politics can only come from you   from people across our country who believe there's a better way and are willing to work for it
years ago, as a community organizer in chicago, i learned that meaningful change always begins at the grassroots, and that engaged citizens working together can accomplish extraordinary things
so even in the midst of the enormous challenges we face today, i have great faith and hope about the future   because i believe in you
and that's why i wanted to tell you first that i'll be filing papers today to create a presidential exploratory committee
for the next several weeks, i'm going to talk with people from around the country, listening and learning more about the challenges we face as a nation, the opportunities that lie before us, and the role that a presidential campaign might play in bringing our country together
and on february 10th, at the end of these discussions and in my home state of illinois, i'll share my plans with my friends, neighbors, and fellow americans
in the meantime, i want to thank all of you for your time, your suggestions, your encouragement, and your prayers
and i look forward to continuing our conversation in the weeks and months to come
thank you lee, for hosting me here at the wilson center, and for your leadership of both the 9/11 commission and the iraq study group
you have been a steady voice of reason in an unsteady time
let me also say that my thoughts and prayers are with your colleague, haleh esfandiari, and her family
i have made my position known to the iranian government
it is time for haleh to be released
it is time for haleh to come home
thanks to the 9/11 commission, we know that six years ago this week president bush received a briefing with the headline
bin ladin determined to strike in u
it came during what the commission called the summer of threat, when the system was blinking red about an impending attack
but despite the briefing, many felt the danger was overseas, a threat to embassies and military installations
the extremism, the resentment, the terrorist training camps, and the killers were in the dark corners of the world, far away from the american homeland
then, one bright and beautiful tuesday morning, they were here
i was driving to a state legislative hearing in downtown chicago when i heard the news on my car radio
a plane had hit the worldtrade center
by the time i got to my meeting, the second plane had hit, and we were told to evacuate
people gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the sears tower, transformed from a workplace to a target
we feared for our families and our country
we mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens
back at my law office, i watched the images from new york
a plane vanishing into glass and steel
men and women clinging to windowsills, then letting go
tall towers crumbling to dust
it seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud, blocking out the september sun
what we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats, we are no longer protected by our own power
and what we saw that morning was a challenge to a new generation
the history of americais one of tragedy turned into triumph
and so a war over secession became an opportunity to set the captives free
an attack on pearl harbor led to a wave of freedom rolling across the atlanticand pacific
an iron curtain was punctured by democratic values, new institutions at home, and strong international partnerships abroad
after 9/11, our calling was to write a new chapter in the american story
to devise new strategies and build new alliances, to secure our homeland and safeguard our values, and to serve a just cause abroad
we were ready
americans were united
friends around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us
we had the might and moral-suasion that was the legacy of generations of americans
the tide of history seemed poised to turn, once again, toward hope
but then everything changed
we did not finish the job against al qaeda in afghanistan
we did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy, or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorists' base of support
we did not reaffirm our basic values, or secure our homeland
instead, we got a color-coded politics of fear
patriotism as the possession of one political party
the diplomacy of refusing to talk to other countries
a rigid 20th century ideology that insisted that the 21st century's stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state
a deliberate strategy to misrepresent 9/11 to sell a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11
and so, a little more than a year after that bright september day, i was in the streets of chicagoagain, this time speaking at a rally in opposition to war in iraq
i did not oppose all wars, i said
i was a strong supporter of the war in afghanistan
but i said i could not support a dumb war, a rash war in iraq
i worried about a  u
occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences in the heart of the muslim world
i pleaded that we finish the fight with bin ladin and al qaeda
the political winds were blowing in a different direction
the president was determined to go to war
there was just one obstacle
the u
congress
nine days after i spoke, that obstacle was removed
congress rubber-stamped the rush to war, giving the president the broad and open-ended authority he uses to this day
with that vote, congress became co-author of a catastrophic war
and we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield, with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create, and no plan for how to get out
because of a war in iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged, we are now less safe than we were before 9/11
according to the national intelligence estimate, the threat to our homeland from al qaeda is persistent and evolving
iraqis a training ground for terror, torn apart by civil war
afghanistan is more violent than it has been since 2001
al qaeda has a sanctuary in pakistan
israel is besieged by emboldened enemies, talking openly of its destruction
iranis now presenting the broadest strategic challenge to the united states in the middle east in a generation
groups affiliated with or inspired by al qaeda operate worldwide
six years after 9/11, we are again in the midst of a summer of threat, with bin ladin and many more terrorists determined to strike in theunited states
what's more, in the dark halls of abu ghraib and the detention cells ofguantanamo, we have compromised our most precious values
what could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power
a tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us
it is time to turn the page
it is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11
just because the president misrepresents our enemies does not mean we do not have them
the terrorists are at war with us
the threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world's 1
3 billion muslims, but the threat is real
they distort islam
they kill man, woman and child
christian and hindu, jew and muslim
they seek to create a repressive caliphate
to defeat this enemy, we must understand who we are fighting against, and what we are fighting for
the president would have us believe that every bomb in baghdadis part of al qaeda's war against us, not an iraqi civil war
he elevates al qaeda in iraq – which didn't exist before our invasion – and overlooks the people who hit us on 9/11, who are training new recruits inpakistan
he lumps together groups with very different goals
al qaeda and iran, shiite militias and sunni insurgents
he confuses our mission
and worse – he is fighting the war the terrorists want us to fight
bin ladin and his allies know they cannot defeat us on the field of battle or in a genuine battle of ideas
but they can provoke the reaction we've seen in iraq
a misguided invasion of a muslim country that sparks new insurgencies, ties down our military, busts our budgets, increases the pool of terrorist recruits, alienates america, gives democracy a bad name, and prompts the american people to question our engagement in the world
by refusing to end the war in iraq, president bush is giving the terrorists what they really want, and what the congress voted to give them in 2002
a u
occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences
it is time to turn the page
when i am president, we will wage the war that has to be won, with a comprehensive strategy with five elements
getting out of iraq and on to the right battlefield in afghanistan and pakistan
developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the world's most deadly weapons
engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism
restoring our values
and securing a more resilient homeland
the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq, and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan
i introduced a plan in january that would have already started bringing our troops out of iraq, with a goal of removing all combat brigades by march 31, 2008
if the president continues to veto this plan, then ending this war will be my first priority when i take office
there is no military solution in iraq
only iraq's leaders can settle the grievances at the heart of iraq's civil war
we must apply pressure on them to act, and our best leverage is reducing our troop presence
and we must also do the hard and sustained diplomatic work in the region on behalf of peace and stability
in ending the war, we must act with more wisdom than we started it
that is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al qaeda within iraq
but we must recognize that al qaeda is not the primary source of violence in iraq, and has little support – not from shia and kurds who al qaeda has targeted, or sunni tribes hostile to foreigners
on the contrary, al qaeda's appeal within iraq is enhanced by our troop presence
ending the war will help isolate al qaeda and give iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out
it will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to afghanistan
our troops have fought valiantly there, but iraq has deprived them of the support they needand deserve
as a result, parts of afghanistan are falling into the hands of the taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country
as president, i would deploy at least two additional brigades toafghanistan to re-enforce our counter-terrorism operations and support nato's efforts against the taliban
as we step up our commitment, our european friends must do the same, and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered nato's efforts
we must also put more of an afghan face on security by improving the training and equipping of the afghan army and police, and including afghan soldiers in u
and nato operations
we must not, however, repeat the mistakes of iraq
the solution in afghanistan is not just military – it is political and economic
as president, i would increase our non-military aid by $1 billion
these resources should fund projects at the local level to impact ordinary afghans, including the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers
and we must seek better performance from the afghan government, and support that performance through tough anti-corruption safeguards on aid, and increased international support to develop the rule of law across the country
above all, i will send a clear message
we will not repeat the mistake of the past, when we turned our back on afghanistan following soviet withdrawal
as 9/11 showed us, the security of afghanistan and america is shared
and today, that security is most threatened by the al qaeda and taliban sanctuary in the tribal regions of northwestpakistan
al qaeda terrorists train, travel, and maintain global communications in this safe-haven
the taliban pursues a hit and run strategy, striking in afghanistan, then skulking across the border to safety
this is the wild frontier of our globalized world
there are wind-swept deserts and cave-dotted mountains
there are tribes that see borders as nothing more than lines on a map, and governments as forces that come and go
there are blood ties deeper than alliances of convenience, and pockets of extremism that follow religion to violence
it's a tough place
but that is no excuse
there must be no safe-haven for terrorists who threaten america
we cannot fail to act because action is hard
as president, i would make the hundreds of millions of dollars inu
military aid to pakistan conditional, and i would make our conditions clear
pakistanmust make substantial progress in closing down the training camps, evicting foreign fighters, and preventing the taliban from using pakistan as a staging area for attacks inafghanistan
i understand that president musharraf has his own challenges
but let me make this clear
there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 americans
they are plotting to strike again
it was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al qaeda leadership meeting in 2005
if we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and president musharraf won't act, we will
and pakistan needs more than f-16s to combat extremism
as the pakistani government increases investment in secular education to counter radical madrasas, my administration will increase america's commitment
we must helppakistan invest in the provinces along the afghan border, so that the extremists' program of hate is met with one of hope
and we must not turn a blind eye to elections that are neither free nor fair – our goal is not simply an ally in pakistan, it is a democratic ally
beyondpakistan, there is a core of terrorists – probably in the tens of thousands – who have made their choice to attack america
so the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down, capture or kill terrorists around the world, and to deny them the world's most dangerous weapons
i will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to america
this requires a broader set of capabilities, as outlined in the army and marine corps's new counter-insurgency manual
i will ensure that our military becomes more stealth, agile, and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists
we need to recruit, train, and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists, and to help foreign militaries to do the same
this must include a program to bolster our ability to speak different languages, understand different cultures, and coordinate complex missions with our civilian agencies
to succeed, we must improve our civilian capacity
the finest military in the world is adapting to the challenges of the 21st century
but it cannot counter insurgent and terrorist threats without civilian counterparts who can carry out economic and political reconstruction missions – sometimes in dangerous places
as president, i will strengthen these civilian capacities, recruiting our best and brightest to take on this challenge
i will increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats, development experts, and other civilians who can work alongside our military
we can't just say there is no military solution to these problems
we need to integrate all aspects of american might
one component of this integrated approach will be new mobile development teams that bring together personnel from the state department, the pentagon, and usaid
these teams will work with civil society and local governments to make an immediate impact in peoples' lives, and to turn the tide against extremism
where people are most vulnerable, where the light of hope has grown dark, and where we are in a position to make a real difference in advancing security and opportunity – that is where these teams will go
i will also strengthen our intelligence
this is about more than an organizational chart
we need leadership that forces our agencies to share information, and leadership that never – ever – twists the facts to support bad policies
but we must also build our capacity to better collect and analyze information, and to carry out operations to disrupt terrorist plots and break up terrorist networks
this cannot just be an american mission
al qaeda and its allies operate in nearly 100 countries
the united states cannot steal every secret, penetrate every cell, act on every tip, or track down every terrorist – nor should we have to do this alone
this is not just about our security
it is about the common security of all the world
as president, i will create a shared security partnership program to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks from the remote islands ofindonesia, to the sprawling cities of africa
this program will provide $5 billion over three years for counter-terrorism cooperation with countries around the world, including information sharing, funding for training, operations, border security, anti-corruption programs, technology, and targeting terrorist financing
and this effort will focus on helping our partners succeed without repressive tactics, because brutality breeds terror, it does not defeat it
we must also do more to safeguard the world's most dangerous weapons
we know al qaeda seeks a nuclear weapon
we know they would not hesitate to use one
yet there is still about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium, some of it poorly secured, at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries
there are still about 15,000 to 16,00 nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium scattered across 11 time zones in the former soviet union
that is why i worked in the senate with dick lugar to pass a law that would help the united statesand our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction
that is why i am introducing a bill with chuck hagel that seeks to prevent
nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons
and that is why, as president, i will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years
while we work to secure existing stockpiles, we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material
and i won't hesitate to use the power of american diplomacy to stop countries from obtaining these weapons or sponsoring terror
the lesson of the bush years is that not talking does not work
go down the list of countries we've ignored and see how successful that strategy has been
we haven't talked to iran, and they continue to build their nuclear program
we haven't talked to syria, and they continue support for terror
we tried not talking to north korea, and they now have enough material for 6 to 8 more nuclear weapons
it's time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action
it's time to turn the page on washington's conventional wisdom that agreement must be reached before you meet, that talking to other countries is some kind of reward, and that presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear
president kennedy said it best
let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate
only by knowing your adversary can you defeat them or drive wedges between them
as president, i will work with our friend and allies, but i won't outsource our diplomacy in tehran to the europeans, or our diplomacy inpyongyang to the chinese
i will do the careful preparation needed, and let these countries know whereamerica stands
they will no longer have the excuse of american intransigence
they will have our terms
no support for terror and no nuclear weapons
but america must be about more than taking out terrorists and locking up weapons, or else new terrorists will rise up to take the place of every one we capture or kill
that is why the third step in my strategy will be drying up the rising well of support for extremism
when you travel to the world's trouble spots as a united states senator, much of what you see is from a helicopter
so you look out, with the buzz of the rotor in your ear, maybe a door gunner nearby, and you see the refugee camp in darfur, the flood near djibouti, the bombed out block in baghdad
you see thousands of desperate faces
al qaeda's new recruits come from africa and asia, the middle eastand europe
many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world
and it makes you stop and wonder
when those faces look up at an american helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate
we know where extremists thrive
in conflict zones that are incubators of resentment and anarchy
in weak states that cannot control their borders or territory, or meet the basic needs of their people
from africato central asia to the pacific rim– nearly 60
countries stand on the brink of conflict or collapse
the extremists encourage the exploitation of these hopeless places on their hate-filled websites
and we know what the extremists say about us
america is just an occupying army in muslim lands, the shadow of a shrouded figure standing on a box at abu ghraib, the power behind the throne of a repressive leader
they say we are at war with islam
that is the whispered line of the extremist who has nothing to offer in this battle of ideas but blame – blameamerica, blame progress, blame jews
and often he offers something along with the hate
a sense of empowerment
maybe an education at a madrasa, some charity for your family, some basic services in the neighborhood
and then
a mission and a gun
we know we are not who they say we are
america is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil
we are not at war with islam
americais a compassionate nation that wants a better future for all people
the vast majority of the world's 1
3 billion muslims have no use for bin ladin or his bankrupt ideas
but too often since 9/11, the extremists have defined us, not the other way around
when i am president, that will change
we will author our own story
we do need to stand for democracy
and i will
but democracy is about more than a ballot box
americamust show – through deeds as well as words – that we stand with those who seek a better life
that child looking up at the helicopter must see america and feel hope
as president, i will make it a focus of my foreign policy to roll back the tide of hopelessness that gives rise to hate
freedom must mean freedom from fear, not the freedom of anarchy
i will never shrug my shoulders and say – as secretary rumsfeld did – freedom is untidy
i will focus our support on helping nations build independent judicial systems, honest police forces, and financial systems that are transparent and accountable
freedom must also mean freedom from want, not freedom lost to an empty stomach
so i will make poverty reduction a key part of helping other nations reduce anarchy
i will double our annual investments to meet these challenges to $50 billion by 2012
and i will support a $2 billion global education fund to counter the radical madrasas – often funded by money from within saudi arabia– that have filled young minds with messages of hate
we must work for a world where every child, everywhere, is taught to build and not to destroy
and as we lead we will ask for more from our friends in europe and asia as well – more support for our diplomacy, more support for multilateral peacekeeping, and more support to rebuild societies ravaged by conflict
i will also launch a program of public diplomacy that is a coordinated effort across my administration, not a small group of political officials at the state department explaining a misguided war
we will open america houses in cities across the islamic world, with internet, libraries, english lessons, stories of america's muslims and the strength they
add to our country, and vocational programs
through a new  america's voice corps we will recruit, train, and send out into the field talented young americans who can speak with – and listen to – the people who today hear about us only from our enemies
as president, i will lead this effort
in the first 100 days of my administration, i will travel to a major islamic forum and deliver an address to redefine our struggle
i will make clear that we are not at war with islam, that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future, and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence
i will speak directly to that child who looks up at that helicopter, and my message will be clear
you matter to us
your future is our future
and our moment is now
this brings me to the fourth step in my strategy
i will make clear that the days of compromising our values are over
major general paul eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country
it included training the iraqi army
after abu ghraib, his senior iraqi advisor came into his office and said
you have no idea how this will play out on the streets of baghdad and the rest of the arab world
how can this be
this was not the america he had looked up to
as the counter-insurgency manual reminds us, we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the people on our side
but because the administration decided to take the low road, our troops have more enemies
because the administration cast aside international norms that reflect american values, we are less able to promote our values
when i am president, america will reject torture without exception
america is the country that stood against that kind of behavior, and we will do so again
i also will reject a legal framework that does not work
there has been only one conviction at guantanamo
it was for a guilty plea on material support for terrorism
the sentence was 9 months
there has not been one conviction of a terrorist act
i have faith in america's courts, and i have faith in our jags
as president, i will close guantanamo, reject the military commissions act, and adhere to the geneva conventions
our constitution and our uniform code of military justice provide a framework for dealing with the terrorists
this administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand
i will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our constitution and our freedom
that means no more illegal wire-tapping of american citizens
no more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime
no more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war
no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient
that is not who we are
and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists
the fisa court works
the separation of powers works
our constitution
works
we will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers, and that justice is not arbitrary
this administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security
it is not
there are no short-cuts to protecting america, and that is why the fifth part of my strategy is doing the hard and patient work to secure a more resilient homeland
too often this administration's approach to homeland security has been to scatter money around and avoid hard choices, or to scare americans without telling them what to be scared of, or what to do
a department set up to make americans feel safer didn't even show up when bodies drifted through the streets in new orleans
that's not acceptable
my administration will take an approach to homeland security guided by risk
i will establish a quadrennial review at the department of homeland security – just like at the pentagon – to undertake a top to bottom review of the threats we face and our ability to confront them
and i will develop a comprehensive national infrastructure protection plan that draws on both local know-how and national priorities
we have to put resources where our infrastructure is most vulnerable
that means tough and permanent standards for securing our chemical plants
improving our capability to screen cargo and investing in safeguards that will prevent the disruption of our ports
and making sure our energy sector – our refineries and pipelines and power grids – is protected so that terrorists cannot cripple our economy
we also have to get past a top-down approach
folks across america are the ones on the front lines
on 9/11, it was citizens – empowered by their knowledge of theworld trade center attacks – who protected our government by heroically taking action on flight 93 to keep it from reaching our nation's capital
when i have information that can empower americans, i will share it with them
information sharing with state and local governments must be a two-way street, because we never know where the two pieces of the puzzle are that might fit together – the tip from afghanistan, and the cop who sees something suspicious on michigan avenue
i will increase funding to help train police to gather information and connect it to the intelligence they receive from the federal government
i will address the problem in our prisons, where the most disaffected and disconnected americans are being explicitly targeted for conversion by al qaeda and its ideological allies
and my administration will not permit more lives to be lost because emergency responders are not outfitted with the communications capability and protective equipment their job requires, or because the federal government is too slow to respond when disaster strikes
we've been through that on 9/11
we've been through it during katrina
i will ensure that we have the resources and competent federal leadership we need to support our communities when american lives are at stake
but this effort can't just be about what we ask of our men and women in uniform
it can't just be about how we spend our time or our money
it's about the kind of country we are
we are in the early stages of a long struggle
yet since 9/11, we've heard a lot about what americacan't do or shouldn't do or won't even try
we can't vote against a misguided war iniraq because that would make us look weak, or talk to other countries because that would be a reward
we can't reach out to the hundreds of millions of muslims who reject terror because we worry they hate us
we can't protect the homeland because there are too many targets, or secure our people while staying true to our values
we can't get past the america of red and blue, the politics of who's up and who's down
that is not the americathat i know
theamerica i know is the last, best hope for that child looking up at a helicopter
it's the country that put a man on the moon
that defeated fascism and helped rebuildeurope
it's a country whose strength abroad is measured not just by armies, but rather by the power of our ideals, and by our purpose to forge an ever more perfect union at home
that's the americai know
we just have to act like it again to write that next chapter in the american story
if we do, we can keep americasafe while extending security and opportunity around the world
we can hold true to our values, and in doing so advance those values abroad
and we can be what that child looking up at a helicopter needs us to be
the relentless opponent of terror and tyranny, and the light of hope to the world
to make this story reality, it's going to take americans coming together and changing the fundamental direction of this country
it's going to take the service of a new generation of young people
it's going to take facing tragedy head-on and turning it into the next generation's triumph
that is a challenge that i welcome
because when we do make that change, we'll do more than win a war – we'll live up to that calling to make america, and the world, safer, freer, and more hopeful than we found it
president, i rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express my support for renewal of the expiring provisions of the voting rights act of 1965
i want to thank the many people inside and outside congress who have worked so hard over the past year to get us here
we owe a great debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle
and we owe special thanks to chairmen sensenbrenner and specter, ranking members conyers and leahy, and representative mel watt
without their work and dedication, and the support of voting rights advocates across the country, i doubt that this bill would have come before us so soon
i want to thank both chambers and both sides of the aisle, as well, for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the original act 40 years ago
at a time when americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of bipartisanship we're seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together
nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965
look at the registration numbers
only two years after the passage of the original act, registration numbers for minority voters in some states doubled
soon after, not a single state covered by the voting rights act had registered less than half of its minority voting age population
look at the influence of african-american elected officials at every single level of government
there are african-american members of congress
since 2001, our nation's top diplomat1 has been african american
in fact, most of america's elected african-american officials come from states covered by section 5 of the voting rights act   states like mississippi, and alabama, louisiana, and georgia
but to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this building in my dear friend congressman john lewis, who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, risking life and limb for freedom
and on march 7th, 1965, he led 600 peaceful protesters, demanding the right to vote, across the edmund pettus bridge in selma, alabama
now, i've often thought about the people on the edmund pettus bridge that day, not only john lewis and hosea williams, who led the march, but the hundreds of everyday americans who left their homes and their churches to join it   blacks and whites, teenagers, children, teachers, bankers, shopkeepers   what dr
king called a beloved community of god's children ready to stand for freedom
and i wonder sometimes   where did they find that kind of courage
you know, when you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback, armed with billy clubs and tear gas   when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the lord for salvation
but the most amazing thing of all is that after that day, after john lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned, and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them   after all that, they went back and marched again
they marched again
they crossed the bridge
they awakened a nation's conscience
and not five months later the voting rights act of 1965 was signed into law
it was reauthorized in 1970, in 1975, and 1982
now, in 2006 john lewis, the physical scars of those marches still visible, is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the voting rights act
and he was joined last week by 389 of his house colleagues in voting for its passage
there were some in the house, and there may be some in the senate, who argue that the act is no longer needed, that the protections of section 5's preclearance'' requirement   a requirement that ensures certain states are upholding the right to vote   are targeting the wrong states
unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion
of the 1100 objections issued by the department of justice since 1965, 56  occurred since the last reauthorization in 1982
over half have occurred since 1982
so despite the progress these states have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist
now, there are others who would argue that we shouldn't renew section 203's protection of language minorities
these arguments have been tied to debates over immigration and they tend to muddle a noncontroversial issue   protecting the right to vote   with one of today's most contentious debates
but let's remember, you can't request language assistance if you're not a voter
and you can't be a voter if you are not a citizen
and while voters, as citizens, must be proficient in english, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors
it's not an unreasonable assumption
a representative of the southwestern voter registration project is quoted as saying, (quote)
citizens who prefer spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process
they also feel they trust the process more when they  understand it
these sentiments, connection to and trust in our democratic process, are exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation
our challenges, of course, don't end at reauthorizing the voting rights act
we have to prevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again
we've seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceive voters about the time, location, and rules of elections
and unfortunately, these efforts have been directed primarily at minority voters   the disabled, low-income individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups
the help america vote act, or hava, was a big step in the right direction
but we've got to do more
we need to fully fund hava if we're going to move forward in the next stage of securing the right to vote for every citizen
we need to enforce critical requirements like statewide registration databases
we need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably and equipment actually works
and we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election day
we need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of some deplorable intimidation tactics when they do go to the polls
you know, in 2004 native american voters in south dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement
these hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps and followed voters to their cars to record their license plates
in lake county, ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus board of election letterhead, informing voters who registered through democratic and naacp drives that they could not vote
in wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the milwaukee black voters league was circulated in predominantly african-american neighborhoods with the following message
if you've already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election
if you violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you
now, think about that
we've got a lot more work to do
this occasion is a cause for celebration
but it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights
as congressman lewis said last week
it's clear that we've come a great distance, but we still have a great distance to go
5,6 now, the memory of selma still lives on in the spirit of the voting rights act
since that day, the voting rights act has been a critical tool in ensuring that all americans not only have the right to vote but have the right to have their vote counted
and those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill
we need to take advantage of this rare, united front and continue to fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls of all americans
in other words, we need to take the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country
you know, two weeks after the first march was turned back, dr
king spoke, and he told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members   he said that they should not despair because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice
the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice
that's because of the work that each of us do that it bends toward justice
it's because of people like john lewis and fannie lou hamer and coretta scott king and rosa parks   all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand   that we are beneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice
that's why i stand here today
i would not be in the united states senate had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice
i hope we continue to see that spirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all our work here in the senate
thank you, mr
president
i yield the floor
thank you very much, mr
president
today, we mourn the passing of coretta scott king
and when i think about coretta scott king, i think about the little girl who walked five miles to school on those rural alabama roads and felt the heat of racism each day she passed the door of the whites-only school, so much closer to home
it didn't matter, because she studied and succeeded and excelled beyond most of her classmates, black and white
she earned a college degree, and an acceptance to a prestigious graduate school up north
and one day she met a young preacher from atlanta, and she fell in love with him
and he told her his dreams   and she believed in those dreams
and she decided that she would help to make them real   not just as a wife or as a friend, but as a partner in freedom's cause
over the next years, coretta scott king did that in so many ways we can't even imagine
she raised a family, she marched through the streets, she inspired through song, she led through speech   even dodged the countless attempts on her family's life
and one of   when one of those attempts finally took her love from this world, she made the selfless decision to carry on
with no time to even cry or mourn, to wallow in anger or vengeance, coretta scott king took to the streets just four days after the assassination and led 50,000 through the streets of memphis in a march for the kind of justice that her husband had given his life for
she spent the rest of here marching for that same justice   leading the king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta, and spreading her family's message of hope to every corner of this world
you know, i had the great honor of   of knowing mrs
king, and the occasion to visit with her in atlanta last year
she was an extraordinarily gracious woman
we sat and chatted in her living room
we   she showed me an album of photographs of her and dr
king and the children
and then she told me what her husband had said to her once, at a time when she was feeling burdened, understandably, by all the stress and strain that had been placed on the family as a consequence of his role in the civil rights movement
she said her husband suggested that
when you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cause, you will never be alone because you will have divine companionship and the support of good people
that was her husband's advice to her   that when you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cause, you will never be alone
coretta scott king died in her sleep last night
she certainly was not alone
she was joined by the companionship and support of a loving family and a grateful nation   inspired by her cause, dedicated to her work, and mournful of her passing
my thoughts, condolences today are with her children
and i ask that she and her husband now rest together in eternal peace
thank you very much, mr
president
you know, four years ago, following the most devastating attack in our history, this body passed the usa patriot act in order to give our nation's law enforcement the tools they needed to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over the world
terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out attacks that may be even deadlier than those that took place on september 11th
we all agree that we need legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to go undetected in this country
and we all agree that we needed to make it harder for them to organize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders
americans everywhere wanted to do that
but soon after the patriot act passed, a few years before i even arrived here in the senate, i began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law, the very purpose of which was to protect us, was also threatening to violate some of the rights and freedoms that we hold most dear
that it didn't just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe but powers that it didn't need to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion
now, in washington, this issue has tended to degenerate into the typical either/or debate
either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles
i would suggest, mr
president, that this is a false choice
it asks too little of us and it assumes too little about america
that's why, as it's come to time to reauthorize the usa patriot act, we've been working in a bipartisan way to do both   to show american people that we can track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties, to show the american people that the federal government will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to do so, not because it can do so
what we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a bipartisan group of senators is some accountability in this process to get answers and see evidence where there is suspicion
several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit
the judiciary committee and the u
senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, while i can't say is perfect, was able to address some of the most serious problems in the existing law
unfortunately, that strong bipartisan legislation has been tossed aside in conference
instead, we've been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address the concerns of members of both parties as well as the american people
this is legislation that puts our own justice department above the law
when national security letters are issued, they allow federal agents to conduct any search on any american, no matter how extensive, how wide ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove that the search is necessary
all that is needed is a signoff from a local fbi agent
that's it
once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched, they are prohibited from telling anyone about it and they're even prohibited from challenging this automatic gag order in court
even though judges have already found that similar restrictions violate the first amendment, this conference report disregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order
if you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on
you will have to tell the fbi that you've done so
think about that
you want to talk to a lawyer about whether or not your actions are going to be causing you to get into trouble, you've got to tell the fbi that you're consulting a lawyer
this is unheard of
there is no such requirement in any other area of the law
i see no reason why it's justified here
and if someone wants to know why their own government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document, through the library books that you read, the phone calls that you've made, the e-mails that you've sent, this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law
no judge will hear your plea
no jury will hear your case
this is just plain wrong
and there are republican senators as well as democratic senators that recognize that it's plain wrong
giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activities is one thing and it's the right thing
but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all americans and the ideals america stands for
now, supporters of this conference report have argued we should just hold our noses and support this legislation because it's not going to get any better
that is not a good argument
we can do better
we've got time to do better
it doesn't convince me that i should support this report
i believe we owe it to the nation, we owe it to those who fought for our civil liberties, we owe it to the future and our children to make sure that we craft the kind of legislation that would make us proud, not just legislation that we would settle for because we're in a rush
we don't have to settle for a patriot act that sacrifices our liberties or our safety
we can have one that secures both
now, there have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of congress to extend the patriot act for three months so that we can reach an agreement on this bill that is well thought through
i support these efforts and will oppose cloture on what i consider to be this unacceptable conference report
president, i thank you
i yield the floor
good morning president taylor, board of trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, the community of galesburg, the class of 1955   which i understand was out partying last night, and yet still showed up here on time   and most of all, the class of 2005
congratulations on your graduation, and thank you   thank you for the honor of allowing me to be a part of it
thank you also, mr
president, for this honorary degree
it was only a couple of years ago that i stopped paying my student loans in law school
had i known it was this easy, i would have ran  for the united states senate earlier
you know, it has been about six months now since you sent me to washington as your united states senator
i recognize that not all of you voted for me, so for those of you muttering under your breath i didn't send you anywhere, that's ok too
maybe we'll hold   what do you call it
a little pumphandle after the ceremony
change your mind for the next time
it has been a fascinating journey thus far
each time i walk onto the senate floor, i'm reminded of the history, for good and for ill, that has been made there
but there have been a few surreal moments
for example, i remember the day before i was sworn in, myself and my staff, we decided to hold a press conference in our office
now, keep in mind that i am ranked 99th in seniority
i was proud that i wasn't ranked dead last until i found out that it's just because illinois is bigger than colorado
so i'm 99th in seniority, and all the reporters are crammed into the tiny transition office that i have, which is right next to the janitor's closet in the basement of the dirksen office building
it's my first day in the building, i have not taken a single vote, i have not introduced one bill, had not even sat down in my desk, and this very earnest reporter raises his hand and says
senator obama, what is your place in history
i did what you just did, which is laugh out loud
i said, place in history
i thought he was kidding
at that point, i wasn't even sure the other senators would save a place for me at the cool kids' table
but as i was thinking about the words to share with this class, about what's next, about what's possible, and what opportunities lay ahead, i actually think it's not a bad question for you, the class of 2005, to ask yourselves
what will be your place in history
in other eras, across distant lands, this question could be answered with relative ease and certainty
as a servant in rome, you knew you'd spend your life forced to build somebody else's empire
as a peasant in 11th century china, you knew that no matter how hard you worked, the local warlord might come and take everything you had   and you also knew that famine might come knocking at the door
as a subject of king george, you knew that your freedom of worship and your freedom to speak and to build your own life would be ultimately limited by the throne
and then america happened
a place where destiny was not a destination, but a journey to be shared and shaped and remade by people who had the gall, the temerity to believe that, against all odds, they could form a more perfect union on this new frontier
and as people around the world began to hear the tale of the lowly colonists who overthrew an empire for the sake of an idea, they started to come
across oceans and the ages, they settled in boston and charleston, chicago and st
louis, kalamazoo and galesburg, to try and build their own american dream
this collective dream moved forward imperfectly   it was scarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, clouded by the subjugation of women, shaken by war and depression
and yet, brick by brick, rail by rail, calloused hand by calloused hand, people kept dreaming, and building, and working, and marching, and petitioning their government, until they made america a land where the question of our place in history is not answered for us
it's answered by us
have we failed at times
absolutely
will you occasionally fail when you embark on your own american journey
you surely will
but the test is not perfection
the true test of the american ideal is whether we're able to recognize our failings and then rise together to meet the challenges of our time
whether we allow ourselves to be shaped by events and history, or whether we act to shape them
whether chance of birth or circumstance decides life's big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, at the very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams
we have faced this choice before
at the end of the civil war, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities to work in the big factories that were sprouting up all across america, we had to decide
do we do nothing and allow captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over the economy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worst working conditions
or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic rules for the market, instituting the first public schools, busting up monopolies, letting workers organize into unions
we chose to act, and we rose together
when the irrational exuberance of the roaring twenties came crashing down with the stock market, we had to decide
do we follow the call of leaders who would do nothing, or the call of a leader who, perhaps because of his physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis
we chose to act   regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding bargaining rights to include health care and a secure retirement   and together we rose
when world war ii required the most massive home front mobilization in history and we needed every single american to lend a hand, we had to decide
do we listen to skeptics who told us it wasn't possible to produce that many tanks and planes
or, did we build roosevelt's arsenal for democracy and grow our economy even further by providing our returning heroes with a chance to go to college and own their own home
again, we chose to act, and again, we rose together
today, at the beginning of this young century, we have to decide again
but this time, it is your turn to choose
here in galesburg, you know what this new challenge is
you've seen it
all of you, your first year in college saw what happened at 9/11
it's already been noted, the degree to which your lives will be intertwined with the war on terrorism that currently is taking place
but what you've also seen, perhaps not as spectacularly, is the fact that when you drive by the old maytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore
i saw it during the campaign when i met union guys who worked at the plant for 20, 30 years and now wonder what they're gonna do at the age of 55 without a pension or health care
when i met the man who's son needed a new liver but because he'd been laid off, didn't know if he could afford to provide his child the care that he needed
it's as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no wonder   no one bothered to tell these folks
and, in reality, the rules have changed
it started with technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete
when was the last time anybody here stood in line for the bank teller instead of going to the atm, or talked to a switchboard operator
then it continued when companies like maytag were able to pick up and move their factories to some under developed country where workers were a lot cheaper than they are in the united states
as tom friedman points out in his new book, the world is flat, over the last decade or so, these forces   technology and globalization   have combined like never before
so that while most of us have been paying attention to how much easier technology has made our own lives   sending e-mails back and forth on our blackberries, surfing the web on our cell phones, instant messaging with friends across the world   a quiet revolution has been breaking down barriers and connecting the world's economies
now business not only has the ability to move jobs wherever there's a factory, but wherever there's an internet connection
countries like india and china realized this
they understand that they no longer need to be just a source of cheap labor or cheap exports
they can compete with us on a global scale
the one resource they needed were skilled, educated workers
so they started schooling their kids earlier, longer, with a greater emphasis on math and science and technology, until their most talented students realized they don't have to come to america to have a decent life   they can stay right where they are
the result
china is graduating four times the number of engineers that the united states is graduating
not only are those maytag employees competing with chinese and indian and indonesian and mexican workers, you are too
today, accounting firms are e-mailing your tax returns to workers in india who will figure them out and send them back to you as fast as any worker in illinois or indiana could
when you lose your luggage in boston at an airport, tracking it down may involve a call to an agent in bangalore, who will find it by making a phone call to baltimore
even the associated press has outsourced some of their jobs to writers all over the world who can send in a story at a click of a mouse
as prime minister tony blair has said, in this new economy, talent is the 21st century wealth
if you've got the skills, you've got the education, and you have the opportunity to upgrade and improve both, you'll be able to compete and win anywhere
if not, the fall will be further and harder than it ever was before
so what do we do about this
how does america find its way in this new, global economy
what will our place in history be
like so much of the american story, once again, we face a choice
once again, there are those who believe that there isn't much we can do about this as a nation
that the best idea is to give everyone one big refund on their government   divvy it up by individual portions, in the form of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own education, and so on
in washington, they call this the ownership society
but in our past there has been another term for it   social darwinism   every man or woman for him or herself
it's a tempting idea, because it doesn't require much thought or ingenuity
it allows us to say that those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford   tough luck
it allows us to say to the maytag workers who have lost their job   life isn't fair
it let's us say to the child who was born into poverty   pull yourself up by your bootstraps
and it is especially tempting because each of us believes we will always be the winner in life's lottery, that we're the one who will be the next donald trump, or at least we won't be the chump who donald trump says
you're fired
but there is a problem
it won't work
it ignores our history
it ignores the fact that it's been government research and investment that made the railways possible and the internet possible
it's been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools that allowed us all to prosper
our economic dependence depended on individual initiative
it depended on a belief in the free market
but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity
that's what's produced our unrivaled political stability
and so if we do nothing in the face of globalization, more people will continue to lose their health care
fewer kids will be able to afford the diploma you're about to receive
more companies like united airlines won't be able to provide pensions for their employees
and those maytag workers will be joined in the unemployment line by any worker whose skills can be bought and sold on the global market
so today i'm here to tell you what most of you already know
this is not us   the option that i just mentioned
doing nothing
it's not how our story ends   not in this country
america is a land of big dreamers and big hopes
it is this hope that has sustained us through revolution and civil war, depression and world war, a struggle for civil and social rights and the brink of nuclear crisis
and it is because our dreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united, more prosperous, and more admired than before
so let's dream
instead of doing nothing or simply defending 20th century solutions, let's imagine together what we could do to give every american a fighting chance in the 21st century
what if we prepared every child in america with the education and skills they need to compete in the new economy
if we made sure that college was affordable for everyone who wanted to go
if we walked up to those maytag workers and we said your old job is not coming back, but a new job will be there because we're going to seriously retrain you and there's life-long education that's waiting for you   the sorts of opportunities that knox has created with the strong futures scholarship program
what if no matter where you worked or how many times you switched jobs, you had health care and a pension that stayed with you always, so you all had the flexibility to move to a better job or start a new business
what if instead of cutting budgets for research and development and science, we fueled the genius and the innovation that will lead to the new jobs and new industries of the future
right now, all across america, there are amazing discoveries being made
if we supported these discoveries on a national level, if we committed ourselves to investing in these possibilities, just imagine what it could do for a town like galesburg
ten or twenty years down the road, that old maytag plant could re-open its doors as an ethanol refinery that turned corn into fuel
down the street, a biotechnology research lab could open up on the cusp of discovering a cure for cancer
and across the way, a new auto company could be busy churning out electric cars
the new jobs created would be filled by american workers trained with new skills and a world-class education
all of that is possible but none of it will come easy
every one of us is going to have to work more, read more, train more, think more
we will have to slough off some bad habits   like driving gas guzzlers that weaken our economy and feed our enemies abroad
our children will have to turn off the tv set once in a while and put away the video games and start hitting the books
we'll have to reform institutions, like our public schools, that were designed for an earlier time
republicans will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even as democrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend old programs
it won't be easy, but it can be done
it can be our future
we have the talent and the resources and brainpower
but now we need the political will
we need a national commitment
and we need each of you
now, no one can force you to meet these challenges
if you want, it will be pretty easy for you to leave here today and not give another thought to towns like galesburg and the challenges they face
there is no community service requirement in the real world
no one is forcing you to care
you can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house, and the nice suits, and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that you should aspire to, that you can buy
but i hope you don't walk away from the challenge
focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition
it asks too little of yourself
you need to take up the challenges that we face as a nation and make them your own
not because you have a debt to those who helped you get here, although you do have that debt
not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate than you, although i do think you do have that obligation
it's primarily because you have an obligation to yourself
because individual salvation has always depended on collective salvation
because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
and i know that all of you are wondering how you'll do this, the challenges seem so big
they seem so difficult for one person to make a difference
but we know it can be done
because where you're sitting, in this very place, in this town, it's happened before
nearly two centuries ago, before civil rights, before voting rights, before abraham lincoln, before the civil war, before all of that, america was stained by the sin of slavery
in the sweltering heat of southern plantations, men and women who looked like me could not escape the life of pain and servitude in which they were sold
and yet, year after year, as this moral cancer ate away at the american ideals of liberty and equality, the nation was silent
but its people didn't stay silent for long
one by one, abolitionists emerged to tell their fellow americans that this would not be our place in history   that this was not the america that had captured the imagination of the world
this resistance that they met was fierce, and some paid with their lives
but they would not be deterred, and they soon spread out across the country to fight for their cause
one man from new york went west, all the way to the prairies of illinois to start a colony
and here in galesburg, freedom found a home
here in galesburg, the main depot for the underground railroad in illinois, escaped slaves could roam freely on the streets and take shelter in people's homes
and when their masters or the police would come for them, the people of this town would help them escape north, some literally carrying them in their arms to freedom
think about the risks that involved
if they were caught abetting a fugitive, you could've been jailed or lynched
it would have been simple for these townspeople to turn the other way
to go live their lives in a private peace
and yet, they didn't do that
why
because they knew that we were all americans
that we were all brothers and sisters
the same reason that a century later, young men and women your age would take freedom rides down south, to work for the civil rights movement
the same reason that black women would walk instead of ride a bus after a long day of doing somebody else's laundry and cleaning somebody else's kitchen
because they were marching for freedom
today, on this day of possibility, we stand in the shadow of a lanky, raw-boned man with little formal education who once took the stage at old main and told the nation that if anyone did not believe the american principles of freedom and equality, that those principles were timeless and all-inclusive, they should go rip that page out of the declaration of independence
my hope for all of you is that as you leave here today, you decide to keep these principles alive in your own life and in the life of this country
you will be tested
you won't always succeed
but know that you have it within your power to try
that generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time
and that through our collective labor, and through god's providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other's burdens, america will continue on its precious journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day
thank you so much class of 2005, and congratulations on your graduation
thank you
senator obama
thank you very much, mr
president
ladies and gentlemen of the senate
i have to say that i didn't anticipate speaking today, but the importance, i think, of this issue is one in which i feel it's important for me to address this body
you know, during the election i had the occasion of meeting a woman who had supported me in my campaign
and she decided to come to shake my hand and take a photograph
a wonderful woman, she wasn't asking for anything, and i was very grateful that she took time to come by
it was a unexceptional moment except for the fact that she was born in 1894
and her name was marguerite lewis, an african-american woman who had been born in louisiana, born in the shadow of slavery, born at a time when lynchings were commonplace, born at a time when african-americans and women could not vote
and yet, over the course of decades she had participated in broadening our democracy and ensuring that, in fact, at some point, if not herself, then her children and her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren would be in a position in which they could, too, call themselves citizens of the united states and make certain that this government works not just on behalf of the mighty and the powerful but also on behalf of people like her
and so the fact that she voted and that her vote was counted in this election was of supreme importance to her and it is the memory of talking to her and shaking her hand that causes me to rise on this occasion
i am absolutely convinced that the president of the united states, george bush, won this election
i also believe that he got more votes in ohio
i think, as has already been said by some of the speakers in this body, he is not some   this is not an issue in which we are challenging the outcome of the election
and i think it's important for us to separate out the issue of the election outcome with the election process
i was not in this body four years ago, but what i observed as a voter, as a citizen of illinois four years ago, were troubling evidence of the fact that not every vote was being counted
and i think that it is unfortunate four years later that we continue to see circumstances in which people who believe that they have the right to vote   who show up at the polls   still continue to confront the sort of problems that have been documented as taking place, not just in ohio, but  places all across the country
i would strongly urge that this chamber, as well as the house of representatives, take it upon itself once and for all to reform this system
there is no reason, at a time when we have enormous battles taking place ideologically all across the globe, at a time when we're try to make certain that we encourage democracy in iraq and afghanistan and other places throughout the world, that we have the legitimacy of our elections challenged, rightly or wrongly, by people who are not certain as to whether our processes are fair and just
this is something that we can fix
we have experts on both sides of the aisle who know how to fix it
what we've lacked is the political will
i would strongly urge that, in a circumstance in which too many voters have stood in long lines for hours, in which too many voters have cast votes on machines that jam or malfunction or suck the votes without a trace, in which too many voters try to register to vote only to discover that their names don't appear on the roles, or that partisan political interests and those that serve them have worked hard to throw up every barrier to recognize them as lawful, in which too many voters will know that there are different elections for different parts of the country and that these differences turn shamefully on differences of wealth or of race, in which too many voters have to contend with state officials, servants of the public, who put partisan or personal political interests ahead of the public in administering our elections   in such circumstances, we have an obligation to fix the problem
and i have to add that this is not a problem unique to this election, and it is not a partisan problem
keep in mind, i come from cook county, from chicago, in which there is a long record of these kinds of problems taking place and disadvantaging republicans as well as democrats
so i would ask that all of us rise up and use this occasion
senate president
senator's time has expired
senator obama
to amend this problem
thank you
thank you so much
thank you
thank you
thank you so much
thank you so much
thank you
thank you
thank you, dick durbin
you make us all proud
on behalf of the great state of illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention
tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely
my father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in kenya
he grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack
his father   my grandfather   was a cook, a domestic servant to the british
but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son
through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, america, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before
while studying here, my father met my mother
she was born in a town on the other side of the world, in kansas
her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the depression
the day after pearl harbor my grandfather signed up for duty
joined patton's army, marched across europe
back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line
after the war, they studied on the g
bill, bought a house through f
, and later moved west all the way to hawaii in search of opportunity
and they, too, had big dreams for their daughter
a common dream, born of two continents
my parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation
they would give me an african name, barack, or blessed, believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success
they imagined   they imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous america you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential
they're both passed away now
and yet, i know that on this night they look down on me with great pride
they stand here   and i stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters
i stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger american story, that i owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible
tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation   not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy
our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago
we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
that is the true genius of america, a faith   a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles
that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm
that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door
that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe
that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted   at least most of the time
this year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations
and fellow americans, democrats, republicans, independents, i say to you tonight
we have more work to do    more work to do for the workers i met in galesburg, illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the maytag plant that's moving to mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour
more to do for the father that i met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on
more to do for the young woman in east st
louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college
now, don't get me wrong
the people i meet   in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks   they don't expect government to solve all their problems
they know they have to work hard to get ahead,  and they want to
go into the collar counties around chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by the pentagon
go in   go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn
they know that parents have to teach, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white
they know those things
people don't expect   people don't expect government to solve all their problems
but they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in america has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all
they know we can do better
and they want that choice
in this election, we offer that choice
our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer
and that man is john kerry
john kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life
from his heroic service to vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the united states senate, he's devoted himself to this country
again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available
his values and his record affirm what is best in us
john kerry believes in an america where hard work is rewarded
so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home
john kerry believes in an america where all americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in washington have for themselves
john kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields
john kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us
and john kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option
you know, a while back   awhile back i met a young man named shamus in a v
hall in east moline, illinois
he was a good-looking kid   six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile
he told me he'd joined the marines and was heading to iraq the following week
and as i listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, i thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child
but then i asked myself, are we serving shamus as well as he is serving us
i thought of the 900 men and women   sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns
i thought of the families i've met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists
when we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world
now   now let me be clear
let me be clear
we have real enemies in the world
these enemies must be found
they must be pursued
and they must be defeated
john kerry knows this
and just as lieutenant kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in vietnam, president kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep america safe and secure
john kerry believes in america
and he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper   for alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the american saga,  a belief that we're all connected as one people
if there is a child on the south side of chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child
if there is a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent
if there's an arab american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties
it is that fundamental belief   it is that fundamental belief
i am my brother's keeper
i am my sister's keeper that makes this country work
it's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one american family
e pluribus unum
out of many, one
now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us   the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes
well, i say to them tonight, there is not a liberal america and a conservative america   there is the united states of america
there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america   there's the united states of america
the pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states
red states for republicans, blue states for democrats
but i've got news for them, too
we worship an awesome god in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states
we coach little league in the blue states and yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states
there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in iraq
we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the united states of america
in the end   in the end   in the end, that's what this election is about
do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope
john kerry calls on us to hope
john edwards calls on us to hope
i'm not talking about blind optimism here   the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it
that's not what i'm talking about
i'm talking about something more substantial
it's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs
the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores
the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the mekong delta
the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds
the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him, too
hope   hope in the face of difficulty
hope in the face of uncertainty
the audacity of hope
in the end, that is god's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation
a belief in things not seen
a belief that there are better days ahead
i believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity
i believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across america from violence and despair
i believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us
america
tonight, if you feel the same energy that i do, if you feel the same urgency that i do, if you feel the same passion that i do, if you feel the same hopefulness that i do   if we do what we must do, then i have no doubt that all across the country, from florida to oregon, from washington to maine, the people will rise up in november, and john kerry will be sworn in as president, and john edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come
thank you very much everybody
god bless you
thank you
vice president, madam speaker, mr
prime minister, members of lok sabha and rajya sabha, and most of all, the people of india
i thank you for the great honor of addressing the representatives of more than one billion indians and the world's largest democracy
i bring the greetings and friendship of the world's oldest democracy   the united states of america, including nearly three million proud and patriotic indian-americans
over the past three days, my wife michelle and i have experienced the   and dynamism of india and its people   from the majesty of humayun's tomb to the advanced technologies that are empowering farmers and women who are the backbone of indian society
from the diwali celebrations with schoolchildren to the innovators who are fueling india's economic rise
from the university students who will chart india's future, to you   leaders who helped to bring india to this moment of extraordinary promise
at every stop, we have been welcomed with the hospitality for which indians have always been known
so, to you and the people of india, on behalf of me, michelle and the american people, please accept my deepest thanks
bahoot dhanyavad
now, i am not the first american president to visit india
nor will i be the last
but i am proud to visit india so early in my presidency
it's no coincidence that india is my first stop on a visit to asia, or that this has been my longest visit to another country since becoming president
for in asia and around the world, india is not simply emerging
india has emerged
and it is my firm belief that the relationship between the united states and india   bound by our shared interests and our shared values   will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century
this is the partnership i've come here to build
this is the vision that our nations can realize together
my confidence in our shared future is grounded in my respect for india's treasured past   a civilization that's been shaping the world for thousands of years
indians unlocked the intricacies of the human body and the vastness of our universe
it's no exaggeration to say that our information age is rooted in indian innovations   including the number zero
of course, india not only opened our minds, she expanded our moral imaginations   with religious texts that still summon the faithful to lives of dignity and discipline, with poets who imagined a future where the mind is without fear and the head is held high   and with a man whose message of love and justice endures   the father of your nation, mahatma gandhi
for me and michelle, this visit has, therefore, held special meaning
see, throughout my life, including my work as a young man on behalf of the urban poor, i've always found inspiration in the life of gandhiji and his simple and profound lesson to be the change we seek in the world
and just as he summoned indians to seek their destiny, he influenced champions of equality in my own country, including a young preacher named martin luther king
after making his pilgrimage to india a half-century ago, dr
king called gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance the only logical and moral approach in the struggle for justice and progress
so we were honored to visit the residence where gandhi and king both stayed   mani bhavan
and we were humbled to pay our respects at raj ghat
and i am mindful that i might not be standing before you today, as president of the united states, had it not been for gandhi and the message he shared and inspired  with america and the world
an ancient civilization of science and innovation
a fundamental faith in human progress   this is the sturdy foundation upon which you have built ever since that stroke of midnight when the tricolor was raised over a free and independent india
and despite the skeptics who said this country was simply too poor, or too vast, or too diverse to succeed, you surmounted overwhelming odds and became a model to the world
instead of slipping into starvation, you launched a green revolution that fed millions
instead of becoming dependent on commodities and exports, you invested in science and technology and in your greatest resource   the indian people
and the world sees the results, from the supercomputers you build to the indian flag that you put on the moon
instead of resisting the global economy, you became one of its engines   reforming the licensing raj and unleashing an economic marvel that has lifted tens of millions of people from poverty and created one of the world's largest middle classes
instead of succumbing to division, you have shown that the strength of india   the very idea of india   is its embrace of all colors, all castes, all creeds
it's the diversity represented in this chamber today
it's the richness of faiths celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of chicago more than a century ago   the renowned swami vivekananda
he said that, holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character
and instead of being lured by the false notion that progress must come at the expense of freedom, you built the institutions upon which true democracy depends   free and fair elections, which enable citizens to choose their own leaders without recourse to arms   an independent judiciary and the rule of law, which allows people to address their grievances
and a thriving free press and vibrant civil society which allows every voice to be heard
this year, as india marks 60 years with a strong and democratic constitution, the lesson is clear
india has succeeded, not in spite of democracy
india has succeeded because of democracy
now, just as india has changed, so, too, has the relationship between our two nations
in the decades after independence, india advanced its interests as a proud leader of the nonaligned movement
yet, too often, the united states and india found ourselves on opposite sides of a north-south divide, estranged by a long cold war
those days are over
here in india, two successive governments led by different parties have recognized that deeper partnership with america is both natural and necessary
and in the united states, both of my predecessors   one a democrat, one a republican   worked to bring us closer, leading to increased trade and a landmark civil nuclear agreement
so since that time, people in both our countries have asked
what's next
how can we build on this progress and realize the full potential of our partnership
that's what i want to address today   the future that the united states seeks in an interconnected world, and why i believe that india is indispensable to this vision
how we can forge a truly global partnership   not just in one or two areas, but across many
not just for our mutual benefit, but for the benefit of the world
of course, only indians can determine india's national interests and how to advance them on the world stage
but i stand before you today because i am convinced that the interests of the united states   and the interests we share with india   are best advanced in partnership
i believe that
the united states seeks security   the security of our country, our allies and partners
we seek prosperity   a strong and growing economy in an open international economic system
we seek respect for universal values
and we seek a just and sustainable international order that promotes peace and security by meeting global challenges through stronger global cooperation
now, to advance these interests, i have committed the united states to comprehensive engagement with the world, based on mutual interest and mutual respect
and a central pillar of this engagement is forging deeper cooperation with 21st century centers of influence   and that must necessarily include india
now, india is not the only emerging power in the world
but relationships between our countries is unique
for we are two strong democracies whose constitutions begin with the same revolutionary words   the same revolutionary words   we the people
we are two great republics dedicated to the liberty and justice and equality of all people
and we are two free market economies where people have the freedom to pursue ideas and innovation that can change the world
and that's why i believe that india and america are indispensable partners in meeting the challenges of our time
since taking office, i've, therefore, made our relationship a priority
i was proud to welcome prime minister singh for the first official state visit of my presidency
for the first time ever, our governments are working together across the whole range of common challenges that we face
now, let me say it as clearly as i can
the united states not only welcomes india as a rising global power, we fervently support it, and we have worked to help make it a reality
together with our partners, we have made the g20 the premier forum for international economic cooperation, bringing more voices to the table of global economic decision-making, and that has included india
we've increased the role of emerging economies like india at international financial institutions
we valued india's important role at copenhagen, where, for the first time, all major economies committed to take action to confront climate change   and to stand by those actions
we salute india's long history as a leading contributor to united nations peacekeeping missions
and we welcome india as it prepares to take its seat on the united nations security council
in short, with india assuming its rightful place in the world, we have an historic opportunity to make the relationship between our two countries a defining partnership of the century ahead
and i believe we can do so by working together in three important areas
first, as global partners we can promote prosperity in both our countries
together, we can create the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future
with my visit, we are now ready to begin implementing our civil nuclear agreement
this will help meet india's growing energy needs and create thousands of jobs in both of our countries
we need to forge partnerships in high-tech sectors like defense and civil space
so we've removed indian organizations from our so-called entity list
and we'll work to remove   and reform our controls on exports
both of these steps will ensure that indian companies seeking high-tech trade and technologies from america are treated the same as our very closest allies and partners
we can pursue joint research and development to create green jobs
give india more access to cleaner, affordable energy
meet the commitments we made at copenhagen
and show the possibilities of low-carbon growth
and together, we can resist the protectionism that stifles growth and innovation
the united states remains   and will continue to remain   one of the most open economies in the world
and by opening markets and reducing barriers to foreign investment, india can realize its full economic potential as well
as g20 partners, we can make sure the global economic recovery is strong and is durable
and we can keep striving for a doha round that is ambitious and is balanced   with the courage to make the compromises that are necessary so global trade works for all economies
together, we can strengthen agriculture
cooperation between indian and american researchers and scientists sparked the green revolution
today, india is a leader in using technology to empower farmers, like those i met yesterday who get free updates on market and weather conditions on their cell phones
and the united states is a leader in agricultural productivity and research
now, as farmers and rural areas face the effects of climate change and drought, we'll work together to spark a second, more sustainable evergreen revolution
together, we're improving indian weather forecasting systems before the next monsoon season
we aim to help millions of indian farmers   farming households save water and increase productivity, improve food processing so crops don't spoil on the way to market, and enhance climate and crop forecasting to avoid losses that cripple communities and drive up food prices
and as part of our food security initiative, we're going to share india's expertise with farmers in africa
and this is an indication of india's rise   that we can now export hard-earned expertise to countries that see india as a model for agricultural development
it's another powerful example of how american and indian partnership can address an urgent global challenge
because the wealth of a nation also depends on the health of its people, we'll continue to support india's effort against diseases like tuberculosis and hiv/aids, and as global partners, we'll work to improve global health by preventing the spread of pandemic flu
and because knowledge is the currency of the 21st century, we will increase exchanges between our students, our colleges and our universities, which are among the best in the world
as we work to advance our shared prosperity, we can partner to address a second priority   and that is our shared security
in mumbai, i met with the courageous families and survivors of that barbaric attack
and here in parliament, which was itself targeted because of the democracy it represents, we honor the memory of all those who have been taken from us, including american citizens on 26/11 and indian citizens on 9/11
this is the bond that we share
it's why we insist that nothing ever justifies the slaughter of innocent men, women and children
it's why we're working together, more closely than ever, to prevent terrorist attacks and to deepen our cooperation even further
and it's why, as strong and resilient societies, we refuse to live in fear
we will not sacrifice the values and rule of law that defines us, and we will never waver in the defense of our people
america's fight against al qaeda and its terrorist affiliates is why we persevere in afghanistan, where major development assistance from india has improved the lives of the afghan people
we're making progress in our mission to break the taliban's momentum and to train afghan forces so they can take the lead for their security
and while i have made it clear that american forces will begin the transition to afghan responsibility next summer, i've also made it clear that america's commitment to the afghan people will endure
the united states will not abandon the people of afghanistan   or the region   to violent extremists who threaten us all
our strategy to disrupt and dismantle and defeat al qaeda and its affiliates has to succeed on both sides of the border
and that's why we have worked with the pakistani government to address the threat of terrorist networks in the border region
the pakistani government increasingly recognizes that these networks are not just a threat outside of pakistan   they are a threat to the pakistani people, as well
they've suffered greatly at the hands of violent extremists over the last several years
and we'll continue to insist to pakistan's leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders are unacceptable, and that terrorists behind the mumbai attacks must be brought to justice
we must also recognize that all of us have an interest in both an afghanistan and a pakistan that is stable and prosperous and democratic   and india has an interest in that, as well
in pursuit of regional security, we will continue to welcome dialogue between india and pakistan, even as we recognize that disputes between your two countries can only be resolved by the people of your two countries
more broadly, india and the united states can partner in asia
today, the united states is once again playing a leadership role in asia   strengthening old alliances
deepening relationships, as we are doing with china
and we're reengaging with regional organizations like asean and joining the east asia summit   organizations in which india is also a partner
like your neighbors in southeast asia, we want india not only to look east, we want india to engage east   because it will increase the security and prosperity of all our nations
as two global leaders, the united states and india can partner for global security   especially as india serves on the security council over the next two years
indeed, the just and sustainable international order that america seeks includes a united nations that is efficient, effective, credible and legitimate
that is why i can say today, in the years ahead, i look forward to a reformed united nations security council that includes india as a permanent member
now, let me suggest that with increased power comes increased responsibility
the united nations exists to fulfill its founding ideals of preserving peace and security, promoting global cooperation, and advancing human rights
these are the responsibilities of all nations, but especially those that seek to lead in the 21st century
and so we look forward to working with india   and other nations that aspire to security council membership   to ensure that the security council is effective
that resolutions are implemented, that sanctions are enforced
that we strengthen the international norms which recognize the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all individuals
this includes our responsibility to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons
since i took office, the united states has reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and we've agreed with russia to reduce our own arsenals
we have put preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism at the top of our nuclear agenda, and we have strengthened the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, which is the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
together, the united states and india can pursue our goal of securing the world's vulnerable nuclear materials
we can make it clear that even as every nation has the right to peaceful nuclear energy, every nation must also meet its international obligations   and that includes the islamic republic of iran
and together, we can pursue a vision that indian leaders have espoused since independence   a world without nuclear weapons
and this leads me to the final area where our countries can partner   strengthening the foundations of democratic governance, not only at home but abroad
in the united states, my administration has worked to make government more open and transparent and accountable to people
here in india, you're harnessing technologies to do the same, as i saw yesterday at an expo in mumbai
your landmark right to information act is empowering citizens with the ability to get the services to which they're entitled   and to hold officials accountable
voters can get information about candidates by text message
and you're delivering education and health care services to rural communities, as i saw yesterday when i joined an e-panchayat with villagers in rajasthan
now, in a new collaboration on open government, our two countries are going to share our experience, identify what works, and develop the next generation of tools to empower citizens
and in another example of how american and indian partnership can address global challenges, we're going to share these innovations with civil society groups and countries around the world
we're going to show that democracy, more than any other form of government, delivers for the common man   and woman
likewise, when indians vote, the whole world watches
thousands of political parties
hundreds of thousands of polling centers
millions of candidates and poll workers   and 700 million voters
there's nothing like it on the planet
there is so much that countries transitioning to democracy could learn from india's experience, so much expertise that india can share with the world
and that, too, is what is possible when the world's largest democracy embraces its role as a global leader
as the world's two largest democracies, we must never forget that the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others
indians know this, for it is the story of your nation
before he ever began his struggle for indian independence, gandhi stood up for the rights of indians in south africa
just as others, including the united states, supported indian independence, india championed the self-determination of peoples from africa to asia as they, too, broke free from colonialism
and along with the united states, you've been a leader in supporting democratic development and civil society groups around the world
and this, too, is part of india's greatness
now, we all understand every country will follow its own path
no one nation has a monopoly on wisdom, and no nation should ever try to impose its values on another
but when peaceful democratic movements are suppressed   as they have been in burma, for example   then the democracies of the world cannot remain silent
for it is unacceptable to gun down peaceful protestors and incarcerate political prisoners decade after decade
it is unacceptable to hold the aspirations of an entire people hostage to the greed and paranoia of bankrupt regimes
it is unacceptable to steal elections, as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see
faced with such gross violations of human rights, it is the responsibility of the international community   especially leaders like the united states and india   to condemn it
and if i can be frank, in international fora, india has often shied away from some of these issues
but speaking up for those who cannot do so for themselves is not interfering in the affairs of other countries
it's not violating the rights of sovereign nations
it is staying true to our democratic principles
it is giving meaning to the human rights that we say are universal
and it sustains the progress that in asia and around the world has helped turn dictatorships into democracies and ultimately increased our security in the world
so promoting shared prosperity, preserving peace and security, strengthening democratic governance and human rights   these are the responsibilities of leadership
and as global partners, this is the leadership that the united states and india can offer in the 21st century
ultimately, though, this cannot be a relationship only between presidents and prime ministers, or in the halls of this parliament
ultimately, this must be a partnership between our peoples
so i want to conclude by speaking directly to the people of india who are watching today
in your lives, you have overcome odds that might have overwhelmed a lesser country
in just decades, you have achieved progress and development that took other nations centuries
you are now assuming your rightful place as a leader among nations
your parents and grandparents imagined this
your children and grandchildren will look back on this
but only this generation of indians can seize the possibilities of the moment
as you carry on with the hard work ahead, i want every indian citizen to know
the united states of america will not simply be cheering you on from the sidelines
we will be right there with you, shoulder to shoulder
because we believe in the promise of india
we believe that the future is what we make it
we believe that no matter who you are or where you come from, every person can fulfill their god-given potential, just as a dalit like dr
ambedkar could lift himself up and pen the words of the constitution that protects the rights of all indians
we believe that no matter where you live   whether a village in punjab or the bylanes of chandni chowk   an old section of kolkata or a new high-rise in bangalore   every person deserves the same chance to live in security and dignity, to get an education, to find work, to give their children a better future
and we believe that when countries and cultures put aside old habits and attitudes that keep people apart, when we recognize our common humanity, then we can begin to fulfill these aspirations that we share
it's a simple lesson contained in that collection of stories which has guided indians for centuries   the panchtantra
and it's the spirit of the inscription seen by all who enter this great hall
that one is mine and the other a stranger is the concept of little minds
but to the large-hearted, the world itself is their family
this is the story of india
this is the story of america   that despite their differences, people can see themselves in one another, and work together and succeed together as one proud nation
and it can be the spirit of partnership between our nations   that even as we honor the histories which in different times kept us apart, even as we preserve what makes us unique in a globalized world, we can recognize how much we can achieve together
and if we let this simple concept be our guide, if we pursue the vision i've described today   a global partnership to meet global challenges   then i have no doubt that future generations   indians and americans   will live in a world that is more prosperous and more secure and more just because of the bonds that our generation has forged today
so, thank you, and jai hind
and long live the partnership between india and the united states
president, mr
secretary-general, my fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen
it is a great honor to address this assembly for the second time, nearly two years after my election as president of the united states
we know this is no ordinary time for our people
each of us comes here with our own problems and priorities
but there are also challenges that we share in common as leaders and as nations
we meet within an institution built from the rubble of war, designed to unite the world in pursuit of peace
and we meet within a city that for centuries has welcomed people from across the globe, demonstrating that individuals of every color, faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity, build a community, and live with the blessing of human liberty
outside the doors of this hall, the blocks and neighborhoods of this great city tell the story of a difficult decade
nine years ago, the destruction of the world trade center signaled a threat that respected no boundary of dignity or decency
two years ago this month, a financial crisis on wall street devastated american families on main street
these separate challenges have affected people around the globe
men and women and children have been murdered by extremists from casablanca to london
from jalalabad to jakarta
the global economy suffered an enormous blow during the financial crisis, crippling markets and deferring the dreams of millions on every continent
underneath these challenges to our security and prosperity lie deeper fears
that ancient hatreds and religious divides are once again ascendant
that a world which has grown more interconnected has somehow slipped beyond our control
these are some of the challenges that my administration has confronted since we came into office
and today, i'd like to talk to you about what we've done over the last 20 months to meet these challenges
what our responsibility is to pursue peace in the middle east
and what kind of world we are trying to build in this 21st century
let me begin with what we have done
i have had no greater focus as president than rescuing our economy from potential catastrophe
and in an age when prosperity is shared, we could not do this alone
so america has joined with nations around the world to spur growth, and the renewed demand that could restart job creation
we are reforming our system of global finance, beginning with wall street reform here at home, so that a crisis like this never happens again
and we made the g20 the focal point for international coordination, because in a world where prosperity is more diffuse, we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerging economies   economies from every corner of the globe
there is much to show for our efforts, even as there is much work to be done
the global economy has been pulled back from the brink of a depression, and is growing once more
we have resisted protectionism, and are exploring ways to expand trade and commerce among nations
but we cannot   and will not   rest until these seeds of progress grow into a broader prosperity, not only for all americans, but for peoples around the globe
as for our common security, america is waging a more effective fight against al qaeda, while winding down the war in iraq
since i took office, the united states has removed nearly 100,000 troops from iraq
we have done so responsibly, as iraqis have transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of their country
we are now focused on building a lasting partnership with the iraqi people, while keeping our commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the end of next year
while drawing down in iraq, we have refocused on defeating al qaeda and denying its affiliates a safe haven
in afghanistan, the united states and our allies are pursuing a strategy to break the taliban's momentum and build the capacity of afghanistan's government and security forces, so that a transition to afghan responsibility can begin next july
and from south asia to the horn of africa, we are moving toward a more targeted approach   one that strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist networks without deploying large american armies
as we pursue the world's most dangerous extremists, we're also denying them the world's most dangerous weapons, and pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons
earlier this year, 47 nations embraced a work-plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years
we have joined with russia to sign the most comprehensive arms control treaty in decades
we have reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy
and here, at the united nations, we came together to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
as part of our effort on non-proliferation, i offered the islamic republic of iran an extended hand last year, and underscored that it has both rights and responsibilities as a member of the international community
i also said   in this hall   that iran must be held accountable if it failed to meet those responsibilities
and that is what we have done
iran is the only party to the npt that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear program, and those actions have consequences
through u
security council resolution 1929, we made it clear that international law is not an empty promise
now let me be clear once more
the united states and the international community seek a resolution to our differences with iran, and the door remains open to diplomacy should iran choose to walk through it
but the iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program
as we combat the spread of deadly weapons, we're also confronting the specter of climate change
after making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at home, we helped forge an accord in copenhagen that   for the first time   commits all major economies to reduce their emissions
we are keenly aware this is just a first step
and going forward, we will support a process in which all major economies meet our responsibilities to protect the planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development
america has also embraced unique responsibilities with come   that come with our power
since the rains came and the floodwaters rose in pakistan, we have pledged our assistance, and we should all support the pakistani people as they recover and rebuild
and when the earth shook and haiti was devastated by loss, we joined a coalition of nations in response
today, we honor those from the u
family who lost their lives in the earthquake, and commit ourselves to stand with the people of haiti until they can stand on their own two feet
amidst this upheaval, we have also been persistent in our pursuit of peace
last year, i pledged my best efforts to support the goal of two states, israel and palestine, living side by side in peace and security, as part of a comprehensive peace between israel and all of its neighbors
we have travelled a winding road over the last 12 months, with few peaks and many valleys
but this month, i am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations between israelis and palestinians in washington, sharm el sheikh and jerusalem
now i recognize many are pessimistic about this process
the cynics say that israelis and palestinians are too distrustful of each other, and too divided internally, to forge lasting peace
rejectionists on both sides will try to disrupt the process, with bitter words and with bombs and with gunfire
some say that the gaps between the parties are too big
the potential for talks to break down is too great
and that after decades of failure, peace is simply not possible
i hear those voices of skepticism
but i ask you to consider the alternative
if an agreement is not reached, palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that comes with their own state
israelis will never know the certainty and security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbors who are committed to coexistence
the hard realities of demography will take hold
more blood will be shed
this holy land will remain a symbol of our differences, instead of our common humanity
i refuse to accept that future
and we all have a choice to make
each of us must choose the path of peace
of course, that responsibility begins with the parties themselves, who must answer the call of history
earlier this month at the white house, i was struck by the words of both the israeli and palestinian leaders
prime minister netanyahu said, i came here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace, security, and dignity
and president abbas said, we will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause
these words must now be followed by action and i believe that both leaders have the courage to do so
but the road that they have to travel is exceedingly difficult, which is why i call upon israelis and palestinians   and the world   to rally behind the goal that these leaders now share
we know that there will be tests along the way and that one test is fast approaching
israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks
and our position on this issue is well known
we believe that the moratorium should be extended
we also believe that talks should press on until completed
now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this obstacle
now is the time to build the trust   and provide the time   for substantial progress to be made
now is the time for this opportunity to be seized, so that it does not slip away
now, peace must be made by israelis and palestinians, but each of us has a responsibility to do our part as well
those of us who are friends of israel must understand that true security for the jewish state requires an independent palestine   one that allows the palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity
and those of us who are friends of the palestinians must understand that the rights of the palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means   including genuine reconciliation with a secure israel
i know many in this hall count themselves as friends of the palestinians
but these pledges of friendship must now be supported by deeds
those who have signed on to the arab peace initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps towards the normalization that it promises israel
and those who speak on behalf of palestinian self-government should help the palestinian authority politically and financially, and in doing so help the palestinians build the institutions of their state
those who long to see an independent palestine must also stop trying to tear down israel
after thousands of years, jews and arabs are not strangers in a strange land
after 60 years in the community of nations, israel's existence must not be a subject for debate
israel is a sovereign state, and the historic homeland of the jewish people
it should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at israel's legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the united states
and efforts to threaten or kill israelis will do nothing to help the palestinian people
the slaughter of innocent israelis is not resistance   it's injustice
and make no mistake
the courage of a man like president abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances, is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children
the conflict between israelis and arabs is as old as this institution
and we can come back here next year, as we have for the last 60 years, and make long speeches about it
we can read familiar lists of grievances
we can table the same resolutions
we can further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate
and we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that will not help a single israeli or palestinian child achieve a better life
we can do that
or, we can say that this time will be different   that this time we will not let terror, or turbulence, or posturing, or petty politics stand in the way
this time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire
this time, we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see jerusalem's soil as sacred
this time we should reach for what's best within ourselves
if we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the united nations   an independent, sovereign state of palestine, living in peace with israel
it is our destiny to bear the burdens of the challenges that i've addressed   recession and war and conflict
and there is always a sense of urgency   even emergency   that drives most of our foreign policies
indeed, after millennia marked by wars, this very institution reflects the desire of human beings to create a forum to deal with emergencies that will inevitably come
but even as we confront immediate challenges, we must also summon the foresight to look beyond them, and consider what we are trying to build over the long term
what is the world that awaits us when today's battles are brought to an end
and that is what i would like to talk about with the remainder of my time today
one of the first actions of this general assembly was to adopt a universal declaration of human rights in 1948
that declaration begins by stating that, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world
the idea is a simple one   that freedom, justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom, justice, and peace in the lives of individual human beings
and for the united states, this is a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity
as robert kennedy said, the individual man, the child of god, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit
so we stand up for universal values because it's the right thing to do
but we also know from experience that those who defend these values for their people have been our closest friends and allies, while those who have denied those rights   whether terrorist groups or tyrannical governments   have chosen to be our adversaries
human rights have never gone unchallenged   not in any of our nations, and not in our world
tyranny is still with us   whether it manifests itself in the taliban killing girls who try to go to school, a north korean regime that enslaves its own people, or an armed group in congo-kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war
in times of economic unease, there can also be an anxiety about human rights
today, as in past times of economic downturn, some put human rights aside for the promise of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom
we see leaders abolishing term limits
we see crackdowns on civil society
we see corruption smothering entrepreneurship and good governance
we see democratic reforms deferred indefinitely
as i said last year, each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its own people
yet experience shows us that history is on the side of liberty
that the strongest foundation for human progress lies in open economies, open societies, and open governments
to put it simply, democracy, more than any other form of government, delivers for our citizens
and i believe that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the borders between nations are blurred
america is working to shape a world that fosters this openness, for the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings
all of us want the right to educate our children, to make a decent wage, to care for the sick, and to be carried as far as our dreams and our deeds will take us
but that depends upon economies that tap the power of our people, including the potential of women and girls
that means letting entrepreneurs start a business without paying a bribe and governments that support opportunity instead of stealing from their people
and that means rewarding hard work, instead of reckless risk-taking
yesterday, i put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goals, recognizing that dignity is a human right and global development is in our common interest
america will partner with nations that offer their people a path out of poverty
and together, we must unleash growth that powers by individuals and emerging markets in all parts of the globe
there is no reason why africa should not be an exporter of agriculture, which is why our food security initiative is empowering farmers
there is no reason why entrepreneurs shouldn't be able to build new markets in every society, which is why i hosted a summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring, because the obligation of government is to empower individuals, not to impede them
the same holds true for civil society
the arc of human progress has been shaped by individuals with the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside of government that insisted upon democratic change and by free media that held the powerful accountable
we have seen that from the south africans who stood up to apartheid, to the poles of solidarity, to the mothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the dirty war, to americans who marched for the rights of all races, including my own
civil society is the conscience of our communities and america will always extend our engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of government
and we will call out those who suppress ideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless
we will promote new tools of communication so people are empowered to connect with one another and, in repressive societies, to do so with security
we will support a free and open internet, so individuals have the information to make up their own minds
and it is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms that advance the rights of civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across borders
open society supports open government, but it cannot substitute for it
there is no right more fundamental than the ability to choose your leaders and determine your destiny
now, make no mistake
the ultimate success of democracy in the world won't come because the united states dictates it
it will come because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed
there is no soil where this notion cannot take root, just as every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation
later this fall, i will travel to asia
and i will visit india, which peacefully threw off colonialism and established a thriving democracy of over a billion people
i'll continue to indonesia, the world's largest muslim-majority country, which binds together thousands of islands through the glue of representative government and civil society
i'll join the g20 meeting on the korean peninsula, which provides the world's clearest contrast between a society that is dynamic and open and free, and one that is imprisoned and closed
and i will conclude my trip in japan, an ancient culture that found peace and extraordinary development through democracy
each of these countries gives life to democratic principles in their own way
and even as some governments roll back reform, we also celebrate the courage of a president in colombia who willingly stepped aside, or the promise of a new constitution in kenya
the common thread of progress is the principle that government is accountable to its citizens
and the diversity in this room makes clear   no one country has all the answers, but all of us must answer to our own people
in all parts of the world, we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable
and now, we must build on that progress
and when we gather back here next year, we should bring specific commitments to promote transparency
to fight corruption
to energize civic engagement
to leverage new technologies so that we strengthen the foundations of freedom in our own countries, while living up to the ideals that can light the world
this institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights
it's time to welcome the efforts of u
women to protect the rights of women around the globe
it's time for every member state to open its elections to international monitors and increase the u
democracy fund
it's time to reinvigorate u
peacekeeping, so that missions have the resources necessary to succeed, and so atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and justice is enforced   because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security
and it's time to make this institution more accountable as well, because the challenges of a new century demand new ways of serving our common interests
the world that america seeks is not one we can build on our own
for human rights to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to speak out
in particular, i appeal to those nations who emerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the second half of the last century   from south africa to south asia
from eastern europe to south america
don't stand idly by, don't be silent, when dissidents elsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten
recall your own history
because part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others
that belief will guide america's leadership in this 21st century
it is a belief that has seen us through more than two centuries of trial, and it will see us through the challenges we face today   be it war or recession
conflict or division
so even as we have come through a difficult decade, i stand here before you confident in the future   a future where iraq is governed by neither tyrant nor a foreign power, and afghanistan is freed from the turmoil of war
a future where the children of israel and palestine can build the peace that was not possible for their parents
a world where the promise of development reaches into the prisons of poverty and disease
a future where the cloud of recession gives way to the light of renewal and the dream of opportunity is available to all
this future will not be easy to reach
it will not come without setbacks, nor will it be quickly claimed
but the founding of the united nations itself is a testament to human progress
remember, in times that were far more trying than our own, our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and equality of human beings would be our common cause
it falls to us to fulfill that promise
and though we will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve, americans have always had cause to believe that we can choose a better history
that we need only to look outside the walls around us
for through the citizens of every conceivable ancestry who make this city their own, we see living proof that opportunity can be accessed by all, that what unites us as human beings is far greater than what divides us, and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace
thank you very much
secretary gates, admiral mullen and members of the armed forces, my fellow americans
most of all, to you   survivors who still carry the scars of tragedy and destruction
to the families who carry in your hearts the memory of the loved ones you lost here
for our nation, this is a day of remembrance, a day of reflection, and   with god's grace   a day of unity and renewal
we gather to remember, at this sacred hour, on hallowed ground   at places where we feel such grief and where our healing goes on
we gather here, at the pentagon, where the names of the lost are forever etched in stone
we gather in a gentle pennsylvania field, where a plane went down and a tower of voices will rise and echo through the ages
and we gather where the twin towers fell, a site where the work goes on so that next year, on the 10th anniversary, the waters will flow in steady tribute to the nearly 3,000 innocent lives
on this day, it's perhaps natural to focus on the images of that awful morning   images that are seared into our souls
it's tempting to dwell on the final moments of the loved ones whose lives were taken so cruelly
yet these memorials, and your presence today, remind us to remember the fullness of their time on earth
they were fathers and mothers, raising their families
brothers and sisters, pursuing their dreams
sons and daughters, their whole lives before them
they were civilians and service members
some never saw the danger coming
others saw the peril and rushed to save others   up those stairwells, into the flames, into the cockpit
they were white and black and brown   men and women and some children made up of all races, many faiths
they were americans and people from far corners of the world
and they were snatched from us senselessly and much too soon   but they lived well, and they live on in you
nine years have now passed
in that time, you have shed more tears than we will ever know
and though it must seem some days as though the world has moved on to other things, i say to you today that your loved ones endure in the heart of our nation, now and forever
our remembrance today also requires a certain reflection
as a nation, and as individuals, we must ask ourselves how best to honor them   those who died, those who sacrificed
how do we preserve their legacy   not just on this day, but every day
we need not look far for our answer
the perpetrators of this evil act didn't simply attack america
they attacked the very idea of america itself   all that we stand for and represent in the world
and so the highest honor we can pay those we lost, indeed our greatest weapon in this ongoing war, is to do what our adversaries fear the most   to stay true to who we are, as americans
to renew our sense of common purpose
to say that we define the character of our country, and we will not let the acts of some small band of murderers who slaughter the innocent and cower in caves distort who we are
they doubted our will, but as americans we persevere
today, in afghanistan and beyond, we have gone on the offensive and struck major blows against al qaeda and its allies
we will do what is necessary to protect our country, and we honor all those who serve to keep us safe
they may seek to strike fear in us, but they are no match for our resilience
we do not succumb to fear, nor will we squander the optimism that has always defined us as a people
on a day when others sought to destroy, we have chosen to build, with a national day of service and remembrance that summons the inherent goodness of the american people
they may seek to exploit our freedoms, but we will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust
they may wish to drive us apart, but we will not give in to their hatred and prejudice
for scripture teaches us to get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice
they may seek to spark conflict between different faiths, but as americans we are not   and never will be   at war with islam
it was not a religion that attacked us that september day   it was al qaeda, a sorry band of men which perverts religion
and just as we condemn intolerance and extremism abroad, so will we stay true to our traditions here at home as a diverse and tolerant nation
we champion the rights of every american, including the right to worship as one chooses   as service members and civilians from many faiths do just steps from here, at the very spot where the terrorists struck this building
those who attacked us sought to demoralize us, divide us, to deprive us of the very unity, the very ideals, that make america america   those qualities that have made us a beacon of freedom and hope to billions around the world
today we declare once more we will never hand them that victory
as americans, we will keep alive the virtues and values that make us who we are and who we must always be
for our cause is just
our spirit is strong
our resolve is unwavering
like generations before us, let us come together today and all days to affirm certain inalienable rights, to affirm life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness
on this day and the days to come, we choose to stay true to our best selves   as one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all
this is how we choose to honor the fallen   your families, your friends, your fellow service members
this is how we will keep alive the legacy of these proud and patriotic americans
this is how we will prevail in this great test of our time
this is how we will preserve and protect the country that we love and pass it   safer and stronger   to future generations
may god bless you and your families, and may god continue to bless the united states of america
good evening
tonight, i'd like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation here at home
i know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many americans
we've now been through nearly a decade of war
we've endured a long and painful recession
and sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that we're trying to build for our nation   a future of lasting peace and long-term prosperity   may seem beyond our reach
but this milestone should serve as a reminder to all americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment
it should also serve as a message to the world that the united states of america intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century
from this desk, seven and a half years ago, president bush announced the beginning of military operations in iraq
much has changed since that night
a war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency
terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear iraq apart
thousands of americans gave their lives
tens of thousands have been wounded
our relations abroad were strained
our unity at home was tested
these are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of america's longest wars
yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides
at every turn, america's men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve
as commander-in-chief, i am incredibly proud of their service
and like all americans, i'm awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families
the americans who have served in iraq completed every mission they were given
they defeated a regime that had terrorized its people
together with iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops fought block by block to help iraq seize the chance for a better future
they shifted tactics to protect the iraqi people, trained iraqi security forces, and took out terrorist leaders
because of our troops and civilians   and because of the resilience of the iraqi people   iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain
so tonight, i am announcing that the american combat mission in iraq has ended
operation iraqi freedom is over, and the iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country
this was my pledge to the american people as a candidate for this office
last february, i announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of iraq, while redoubling our efforts to strengthen iraq's security forces and support its government and people
that's what we've done
we've removed nearly 100,000 u
troops from iraq
we've closed or transferred to the iraqis hundreds of bases
and we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of iraq
this completes a transition to iraqi responsibility for their own security
troops pulled out of iraq's cities last summer, and iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens
even as iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began
and iraqi forces have taken the fight to al qaeda, removing much of its leadership in iraqi-led operations
this year also saw iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout
a caretaker administration is in place as iraqis form a government based on the results of that election
tonight, i encourage iraq's leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just, representative, and accountable to the iraqi people
and when that government is in place, there should be no doubt
the iraqi people will have a strong partner in the united states
our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to iraq's future is not
going forward, a transitional force of u
troops will remain in iraq with a different mission
advising and assisting iraq's security forces, supporting iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians
consistent with our agreement with the iraqi government, all u
troops will leave by the end of next year
as our military draws down, our dedicated civilians   diplomats, aid workers, and advisors   are moving into the lead to support iraq as it strengthens its government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by war, and builds ties with the region and the world
that's a message that vice president biden is delivering to the iraqi people through his visit there today
this new approach reflects our long-term partnership with iraq   one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect
of course, violence will not end with our combat mission
extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife
but ultimately, these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals
iraqis are a proud people
they have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction
they understand that, in the end, only iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets
only iraqis can build a democracy within their borders
what america can do, and will do, is provide support for the iraqi people as both a friend and a partner
ending this war is not only in iraq's interest   it's in our own
the united states has paid a huge price to put the future of iraq in the hands of its people
we have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home
we've persevered because of a belief we share with the iraqi people   a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization
through this remarkable chapter in the history of the united states and iraq, we have met our responsibility
now, it's time to turn the page
as we do, i'm mindful that the iraq war has been a contentious issue at home
here, too, it's time to turn the page
this afternoon, i spoke to former president george w
bush
it's well known that he and i disagreed about the war from its outset
yet no one can doubt president bush's support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security
as i've said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it
and all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for iraqis' future
the greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead
and no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al qaeda
americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11
now, as we approach our 10th year of combat in afghanistan, there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there
but we must never lose sight of what's at stake
as we speak, al qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of afghanistan and pakistan
we will disrupt, dismantle and defeat al qaeda, while preventing afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists
and because of our drawdown in iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense
in fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al qaeda leaders   and hundreds of al qaeda's extremist allies   have been killed or captured around the world
within afghanistan, i've ordered the deployment of additional troops who   under the command of general david petraeus   are fighting to break the taliban's momentum
as with the surge in iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future
but, as was the case in iraq, we can't do for afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves
that's why we're training afghan security forces and supporting a political resolution to afghanistan's problems
and next august, we will begin a transition to afghan responsibility
the pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for afghanistan will endure
but make no mistake
this transition will begin   because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the afghan people's
indeed, one of the lessons of our effort in iraq is that american influence around the world is not a function of military force alone
we must use all elements of our power   including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of america's example   to secure our interests and stand by our allies
and we must project a vision of the future that's based not just on our fears, but also on our hopes   a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world, but also the limitless possibilities of our time
today, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners
new markets for our goods stretch from asia to the americas
a new push for peace in the middle east will begin here tomorrow
billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict
as the leader of the free world, america will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction   we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people
now, that effort must begin within our own borders
throughout our history, america has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas, understanding its links to our own liberty and security
but we have also understood that our nation's strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home
and the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class
unfortunately, over the last decade, we've not done what's necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity
we spent a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas
this, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits
for too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform
as a result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nation's long-term competitiveness is put at risk
and so at this moment, as we wind down the war in iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy, and grit, and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad
they have met every test that they faced
now, it's our turn
now, it's our responsibility to honor them by coming together, all of us, and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for   the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it
our most urgent task is to restore our economy, and put the millions of americans who have lost their jobs back to work
to strengthen our middle class, we must give all our children the education they deserve, and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy
we must jumpstart industries that create jobs, and end our dependence on foreign oil
we must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines, and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs
this will be difficult
but in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as president
part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor
as long as i am president, we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us
this is a sacred trust
that's why we've already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades
we're treating the signature wounds of today's wars   post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury   while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned
and we're funding a post-9/11 gi bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education
just as the gi bill helped those who fought world war ii   including my grandfather   become the backbone of our middle class, so today's servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the american economy
because part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it
two weeks ago, america's final combat brigade in iraq   the army's fourth stryker brigade   journeyed home in the pre-dawn darkness
thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from baghdad, the last of them passing into kuwait in the early morning hours
over seven years before, american troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways, but this time no shots were fired
it was just a convoy of brave americans, making their way home
of course, the soldiers left much behind
some were teenagers when the war began
many have served multiple tours of duty, far from families who bore a heroic burden of their own, enduring the absence of a husband's embrace or a mother's kiss
most painfully, since the war began, 55 members of the fourth stryker brigade made the ultimate sacrifice   part of over 4,400 americans who have given their lives in iraq
as one staff sergeant said, i know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died, this day would probably mean a lot
those americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries
along with nearly 1
5 million americans who have served in iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew
they stared into the darkest of human creations   war   and helped the iraqi people seek the light of peace
in an age without surrender ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation
every american who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from lexington to gettysburg
from iwo jima to inchon
from khe sanh to kandahar   americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own
our troops are the steel in our ship of state
and though our nation may be travelling through rough waters, they give us confidence that our course is true, and that beyond the pre-dawn darkness, better days lie ahead
thank you
may god bless you
and may god bless the united states of america, and all who serve her
well, welcome to the white house
to you, to muslim americans across our country, and to more than one billion muslims around the world, i extend my best wishes on this holy month
ramadan kareem
i want to welcome members of the diplomatic corps
members of my administration
and members of congress, including rush holt, john conyers, and andre carson, who is one of two muslim american members of congress, along with keith ellison
so welcome, all of you
here at the white house, we have a tradition of hosting iftars that goes back several years, just as we host christmas parties and seders and diwali celebrations
and these events celebrate the role of faith in the lives of the american people
they remind us of the basic truth that we are all children of god, and we all draw strength and a sense of purpose from our beliefs
these events are also an affirmation of who we are as americans
our founders understood that the best way to honor the place of faith in the lives of our people was to protect their freedom to practice religion
in the virginia act of establishing religion freedom, thomas jefferson wrote that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion
the first amendment of our constitution established the freedom of religion as the law of the land
and that right has been upheld ever since
indeed, over the course of our history, religion has flourished within our borders precisely because americans have had the right to worship as they choose   including the right to believe in no religion at all
and it is a testament to the wisdom of our founders that america remains deeply religious   a nation where the ability of peoples of different faiths to coexist peacefully and with mutual respect for one another stands in stark contrast to the religious conflict that persists elsewhere around the globe
now, that's not to say that religion is without controversy
recently, attention has been focused on the construction of mosques in certain communities   particularly new york
now, we must all recognize and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower manhattan
the 9/11 attacks were a deeply traumatic event for our country
and the pain and the experience of suffering by those who lost loved ones is just unimaginable
so i understand the emotions that this issue engenders
and ground zero is, indeed, hallowed ground
but let me be clear
as a citizen, and as president, i believe that muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country
and that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances
this is america
and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakeable
the principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country and that they will not be treated differently by their government is essential to who we are
the writ of the founders must endure
we must never forget those who we lost so tragically on 9/11, and we must always honor those who led the response to that attack   from the firefighters who charged up smoke-filled staircases, to our troops who are serving in afghanistan today
and let us also remember who we're fighting against, and what we're fighting for
our enemies respect no religious freedom
al qaeda's cause is not islam   it's a gross distortion of islam
these are not religious leaders   they're terrorists who murder innocent men and women and children
in fact, al qaeda has killed more muslims than people of any other religion   and that list of victims includes innocent muslims who were killed on 9/11
so that's who we're fighting against
and the reason that we will win this fight is not simply the strength of our arms   it is the strength of our values
the democracy that we uphold
the freedoms that we cherish
the laws that we apply without regard to race, or religion, or wealth, or status
our capacity to show not merely tolerance, but respect towards those who are different from us   and that way of life, that quintessentially american creed, stands in stark contrast to the nihilism of those who attacked us on that september morning, and who continue to plot against us today
in my inaugural address i said that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness
we are a nation of christians and muslims, jews and hindus   and non-believers
we are shaped by every language and every culture, drawn from every end of this earth
and that diversity can bring difficult debates
this is not unique to our time
past eras have seen controversies about the construction of synagogues or catholic churches
but time and again, the american people have demonstrated that we can work through these issues, and stay true to our core values, and emerge stronger for it
so it must be   and will be   today
and tonight, we are reminded that ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity
and ramadan is a reminder that islam has always been a part of america
the first muslim ambassador to the united states, from tunisia, was hosted by president jefferson, who arranged a sunset dinner for his guest because it was ramadan   making it the first known iftar at the white house, more than 200 years ago
like so many other immigrants, generations of muslims came to forge their future here
they became farmers and merchants, worked in mills and factories
they helped lay the railroads
they helped to build america
they founded the first islamic center in new york city in the 1890s
they built america's first mosque on the prairie of north dakota
and perhaps the oldest surviving mosque in america   still in use today   is in cedar rapids, iowa
today, our nation is strengthened by millions of muslim americans
they excel in every walk of life
muslim american communities   including mosques in all 50 states   also serve their neighbors
muslim americans protect our communities as police officers and firefighters and first responders
muslim american clerics have spoken out against terror and extremism, reaffirming that islam teaches that one must save human life, not take it
and muslim americans serve with honor in our military
at next week's iftar at the pentagon, tribute will be paid to three soldiers who gave their lives in iraq and now rest among the heroes of arlington national cemetery
these muslim americans died for the security that we depend on, and the freedoms that we cherish
they are part of an unbroken line of americans that stretches back to our founding
americans of all faiths who have served and sacrificed to extend the promise of america to new generations, and to ensure that what is exceptional about america is protected   our commitment to stay true to our core values, and our ability slowly but surely to perfect our union
for in the end, we remain one nation, under god, indivisible
and we can only achieve liberty and justice for all if we live by that one rule at the heart of every great religion, including islam   that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us
so thank you all for being here
i wish you a blessed ramadan
and with that, let us eat
it is   thank you
it is a great honor and   it is true, i will be 49 this week
i have a lot more gray hair than i did last year
it is an extraordinary honor to be here
thank you, commander barrera, for your kind introduction and for your lifetime of service, in the marines in vietnam   but also as a tireless advocate for your fellow disabled veterans
we are grateful to you
thank you for everything that you've done
i want to thank your great leadership team for welcoming me today
chairman ray dempsey   absolutely   incoming commander wally tyson
national adjutant art wilson
judy hezlep of the dav auxiliary
and your outstanding executive director in washington, dave gorman
and i am pleased to be joined by a decorated vietnam veteran, wounded warrior, and a lifetime member of the dav   my outstanding secretary of veterans affairs, ric shinseki
disabled american veterans, i valued your advice and counsel when i was a senator, when i co-sponsored the post-9/11 gi bill
you were one of the first veterans organizations that i called upon when i began my presidential campaign
and as president, it's been my pleasure to welcome you to the white house   to make sure america is serving our veterans as well as you've served us
and, most recently, to sign advanced appropriations into law so that veterans health care will never again be held hostage to the budget battles and the political games in washington
now, there's another visit i won't forget
i was in the oval office expecting a visit from the dav
and in comes bobby carrying a baseball bat
now, it's not every day that somebody gets past the secret service carrying a baseball bat
you may have heard about this
it turns out it was a genuine louisville slugger   a thank you for going to bat for our veterans on advanced appropriations
so i'm grateful for that symbol of our partnership, and i'm proud of the progress we've achieved together
but as one of your outstanding dav members from illinois just reminded me, this is a promise i made during the campaign   it was a promise made and it was a promise kept
and i intend to keep on keeping my promises to the veterans of america
in the life of our nation, not every generation has been summoned to defend our country in its hour of need
but every generation to answer that call has done so with honor and with courage
among you are members of that generation that saved the world from fascism
i was honored to stand with our world war ii vets at normandy last year for the anniversary of d-day
and this year, as we mark   this year, as we mark the 65th anniversary of our victory in that war, we once again salute our veterans of the second world war
others among you faced a brutal foe on a cold korean peninsula
this year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of that conflict, i will be proud to travel to the republic of korea in november to pay tribute to our veterans of the korean war
many of you served in the jungles of vietnam
you also served with honor, exemplary dedication and courage, but were often shunned when you came home
that was a national disgrace and it must never happen again
and that's why we're making sure our veterans from today's wars are shown the respect and the dignity they deserve
and whether you served in the gulf to free a captive kuwait or fought in the streets of mogadishu or stopped an ethnic slaughter in the balkans, you too are part of an unbroken line of service stretching across two centuries
for you, coming home was the beginning of another battle   the battle to recover
you fought to stand again and to walk again and to work again
you fought for each other and for the benefits and treatment you had earned
you became leaders in our communities, in our companies, and our country   including a former vietnam vet and senator, max cleland, who reminded us that america's disabled veterans are strong at the broken places
today, your legacy of service is carried on by a new generation of americans
some stepped forward in a time of peace, not foreseeing years of combat
others stepped forward in this time of war, knowing they could be sent into harm's way
for the past nine years, in afghanistan and iraq, they have borne the burdens of war
they, and their families, have faced the greatest test in the history of our all-volunteer force, serving tour after tour, year after year
through their extraordinary service, they have written their own chapter in the american story
and by any measure, they have earned their place among the greatest of generations
now, one of those chapters is nearing an end
as a candidate for president, i pledged to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end
shortly after taking office, i announced our new strategy for iraq and for a transition to full iraqi responsibility
and i made it clear that by august 31st, 2010, america's combat mission in iraq would end
and that is exactly what we are doing   as promised and on schedule
already, we have closed or turned over to iraq hundreds of bases
we're moving out millions of pieces of equipment in one of the largest logistics operations that we've seen in decades
by the end of this month, we'll have brought more than 90,000 of our troops home from iraq since i took office   more than 90,000 have come home
today   even as terrorists try to derail iraq's progress   because of the sacrifices of our troops and their iraqi partners, violence in iraq continues to be near the lowest it's been in years
and next month, we will change our military mission from combat to supporting and training iraqi security forces
in fact, in many parts of the country, iraqis have already taken the lead for security
as agreed to with the iraqi government, we will maintain a transitional force until we remove all our troops from iraq by the end of next year
and during this period, our forces will have a focused mission   supporting and training iraqi forces, partnering with iraqis in counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts
these are dangerous tasks
there are still those with bombs and bullets who will try to stop iraq's progress
and the hard truth is we have not seen the end of american sacrifice in iraq
but make no mistake
our commitment in iraq is changing   from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats
and as we mark the end of america's combat mission in iraq, a grateful america must pay tribute to all who served there
remember, our nation has had vigorous debates about the iraq war
there are patriots who supported going to war, and patriots who opposed it
but there has never been any daylight between us when it comes to supporting the more than one million americans in uniform who have served in iraq   far more than any conflict since vietnam
these men and women from across our country have done more than meet the challenges of this young century
through their extraordinary courage and confidence and commitment, these troops and veterans have proven themselves as a new generation of american leaders
and while our country has sometimes been divided, they have fought together as one
while other individuals and institutions have shirked responsibility, they have welcomed responsibility
while it was easy to be daunted by overwhelming challenges, the generation that has served in iraq has overcome every test before them
they took to the skies and sped across deserts in the initial charge into baghdad
and today we're joined by an infantryman who was there as part of the 101st airborne division   sergeant nicholas bernardi is here
when invasion gave way to insurgency, our troops persevered, block by block, city by city, from baghdad to fallujah
as a driver in a transportation company, this soldier endured constant attacks but never waivered in his mission   and we thank sergeant dan knabe
thank you, dan
when terrorists and militias plunged iraq into sectarian war, our troops adapted and adjusted   restoring order and effectively defeating al qaeda in iraq on the battlefield
and among those who served in those pivotal days was a scout with the 1st cavalry division   specialist matt seidl
matt
for each of these men and women there are countless others
and we honor them all
our young enlisted troops and noncommissioned officers who are the backbone of our military
the national guardsmen and reservists who served in unprecedented deployments
more women tested by combat than in any war in american history
including a marine here today   sergeant patricia ruiz
patricia
i teased patricia
i said she looks like she's still in high school
but she's a marine
and we salute the families back home
they too have sacrificed in this war
that's why my wife, michelle, and the vice president's wife, dr
jill biden, have made it their mission to make sure america takes care of our remarkable military families, including our veterans
now, this summer, tens of thousands of our troops in iraq are coming home
last week, vice president biden was at fort drum to help welcome back members of the legendary 10th mountain division
families are being reunited at bases across the country, from fort bragg in north carolina to fort riley in kansas to fort lewis in washington
and in this season of homecomings, every american can show their gratitude to our patriots who served in iraq
as we do, we are humbled by the profound sacrifice that has been rendered
each of the veterans i have mentioned carried with them the wounds of this war
and as a nation, we will honor forever all who gave their lives   that last true measure of devotion   in service in iraq   soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen   active, guard, reserve
even as we end the war in iraq, even as we welcome home so many of our troops, others are still deployed in afghanistan
so i want to remind everyone, it was afghanistan where al qaeda plotted and trained to murder 3,000 innocent people on 9/11
it is afghanistan and the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists have launched other attacks against us and our allies
and if afghanistan were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency, al qaeda and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack
and as president of the united states, i refuse to let that happen
the effort in afghanistan has been long and been difficult
and that's why after years in which the situation had deteriorated, i announced a new strategy last december   a military effort to break the taliban's momentum and train afghan forces so that they can take the lead for their security
and a civilian effort to promote good governance and development that improves the lives of the afghan people
and deeper cooperation with pakistan to root out terrorists on both sides of the border
we will continue to face huge challenges in afghanistan
but it's important that the american people know that we are making progress and we are focused on goals that are clear and achievable
on the military front, nearly all the additional forces that i ordered to afghanistan are now in place
along with our afghan and international partners, we are going on the offensive against the taliban   targeting their leaders, challenging them in regions where they had free reign, and training afghan national security forces
our thoughts and prayers are with all our troops risking their lives for our safety in afghanistan
and on the civilian front, we're insisting on greater accountability
and the afghan government has taken concrete steps to foster development and combat corruption, and to put forward a reintegration plan that allows afghans to lay down their arms
in pakistan, we've seen the government begin to take the fight to violent extremists within its borders, and major blows have been struck against al qaeda and its leadership   because in this region and beyond, we will tolerate no safe haven for al qaeda and their extremist allies
we will disrupt, we will dismantle, and we will ultimately defeat al qaeda
and we will give our troops the resources and the equipment to get the job done and keep our country safe
at the same time, every american who has ever worn the uniform must also know this
your country is going to take care of you when you come home
our nation's commitment to our veterans, to you and your families, is a sacred trust
and to me and my administration, upholding that trust is a moral obligation
it's not just politics
that's why i've charged secretary shinseki with building a 21st century va
and that includes one of the largest percentage increases to the va budget in the past 30 years
we are going to cut this deficit that we've got, and i've proposed a freeze on discretionary domestic spending
but what i have not frozen is the spending we need to keep our military strong, our country safe and our veterans secure
so we're going to keep on making historic commitments to our veterans
for about 200,000 vietnam vets who may have been exposed to agent orange and who now suffer from three chronic diseases, we're making it easier for you to get the health care and benefits you need
for our gulf war veterans, we've declared that nine infectious diseases are now presumed to be related to your service in desert storm
for our disabled veterans, we've eliminated co-pays for those of you who are catastrophically disabled
we've kept our promise on concurrent receipt by proposing legislation that would allow severely disabled retirees to receive your military retired pay and your va disability benefits
it's the right thing to do
we've dramatically increased funding for veterans health care across the board, and that includes improving care for rural veterans and women veterans
for those half-million vets who had lost their eligibility   our priority 8 veterans   we're restoring your access to va health care
and since the rumors continue to fly, even though they are wrong, let me say it as clearly as i can
the historic health care reform legislation that i signed into law does not   i repeat, does not   change your veterans benefits
the va health care benefits that you know and trust are safe, and that includes prosthetics for our disabled veterans
thanks to advanced appropriations, the delays for funding for veterans medical care are over
and just as those delays were unacceptable, so too are long delays in the claims process
so secretary shinseki is working overtime to create a single lifetime electronic record that our troops and veterans can keep for life
and today   today i can announce that for the first time ever, veterans will be able to go to the va website, click a simple blue button, and download or print your personal health records so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors outside of the va
that's happening this fall
we're hiring thousands of new claims processors to break the backlog once and for all
and to make sure the backlog doesn't come back, we're reforming the claims process itself with new information technologies and a paperless system
we got an amen over here
as a result of the innovation competition that i announced last summer, our dedicated va employees suggested more than 10,000 new ways to cut through the red tape and the bureaucracy
and we're already putting dozens of these innovative ideas into action
additionally, we're enabling more veterans to check the status of their claims online and from their cell phone
as a next step, we're opening this competition to entrepreneurs and academics so the best minds in america can help us develop the technologies to serve our vets, including those of you with multiple traumatic injuries
and we're going to keep at this until we meet our commitment to cut those backlogs, slash those wait times, and deliver your benefits sooner
this is a priority and we are going to get it done
we're making progress in ending homelessness among our veterans
today, on any given night, there are about 20,000 fewer veterans on the streets than there were when we took office
but we're not going to be satisfied until every veteran who has fought for america has a home in america
we will not stop
finally, we're keeping faith with our newest veterans returning from afghanistan and iraq
we're offering more of the support and counseling they need to transition back to civilian life
that includes funding the post-9/11 gi bill, which is already helping more than 300,000 veterans and family members pursue their dream of a college education
and for veterans trying to find work in a very tough economy, we're helping with job training and placement
and i've directed the federal government to make it a priority to hire more veterans, including disabled veterans
and every business in america needs to know our vets have the training, they've got the skills, they have the dedication   they are ready to work
and our country is stronger when we tap the incredible talents of our veterans
for those coming home injured, we're continuing to direct unprecedented support to our wounded warriors in uniform   more treatment centers, more case managers   delivering the absolute best care available
for those who can, we want to help them get back to where they want to be   with their units
and that includes service members with a disability, who still have so much to offer our military
we're directing unprecedented resources to treating the signature wounds of today's wars   traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder
and i recently signed into law the caregivers and veterans omnibus health services act
that's a long name, but let me tell you what it does
it not only improves treatment for traumatic brain injury and ptsd, it gives new support to many of the caregivers who put their own lives on hold to care for their loved one
and as so many of you know, ptsd is a pain like no other   the nightmares that keep coming back, the rage that strikes suddenly, the hopelessness that's led too many of our troops and veterans to take their own lives
so today, i want to say in very personal terms to anyone who is struggling   don't suffer in silence
it's not a sign of weakness to reach out for support   it's a sign of strength
your country needs you
we are here for you
we are here to help you stand tall
don't give up
reach out
we're making major investments in awareness, outreach, and suicide prevention   hiring more mental health professionals, improving care and treatment
for those of you suffering from ptsd, we're making it a whole lot easier to qualify for va benefits
from now on, if a va doctor confirms a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder, that is enough   no matter what war you served in
these are the commitments my administration has made
these are the promises we've worked to keep
this is the sacred trust we have pledged to uphold   to you and all who serve
i want to make special mention of a truly inspiring american, staff sergeant cory remsburg
he was at bethesda during one of my periodic visits to see our wounded warriors
and as i walked into his room, i saw a picture on the wall   and it was a picture of the two of us together
see, i had met cory before, back at the d-day anniversary in normandy
a good looking young man, a proud army ranger, he had joined in a reenactment of that historic paratroop jump
then soon after, cory served on his 10th deployment since 9/11   that's right, his 10th deployment
and that's when an ied nearly took his life
the traumatic brain injury was severe
cory was in a coma for months
it seemed possible that he would never wake up
but then something happened
his doctors still can't explain it
his parents called it a miracle
cory opened one of his eyes
then a few weeks later, he moved a leg
then he moved an arm
and there at bethesda, we were meeting again
and cory still couldn't speak
but he looked me in the eye
he lifted his arm and he shook my hand firmly
and when i asked how he was feeling, he held up his hand, pulled his fingers together and gave a thumbs up
today, cory is at a va hospital in florida
and with the support of his family and va staff, he's working hard every day to regain his strength
he's got to learn to speak all over again
he's grateful for the visits he's received from friends and supporters   including the disabled american veterans
and cory is only 27 years old
he knows he's got a long and very hard road ahead
but he pushes on, and he's determined to get back to his fellow rangers
and when someone at the hospital said, cory, you're going to walk out of here someday, he said no, i'm going to run out of here
so to staff sergeant cory remsburg, to the disabled american veterans   i want to say to all of you, you are the very essence of america, the values that sustain us as a people, and the virtues our nation needs most right now
and the resilience that, in the face of great loss, so many of you experienced, i know you, like cory, know what it means to pick yourselves up and keep pushing on
and that sense of purpose that tells us to carry on, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard, even when the odds seem overwhelming   that's what we're about
the confidence that our destiny is never written for us, it's written by us
the faith, that fundamental american faith, that there are always brighter days ahead
and that we not will not simply endure, but we will emerge from our tests and trials and tribulations stronger than before   that is your story
that is america's story
and i'm proud to stand with you as we write the next proud chapter in the life of the country we love
god bless you, and god bless the united states of america
thank you
everybody, please have a seat, have a seat
well, good morning, everyone
we are gathered in the heart of our nation's capital, surrounded by memorials to leaders and citizens who served our nation in its earliest days and in its days of greatest trial
today is such a time for america
over the past two years, we have faced the worst recession since the great depression
eight million people lost their jobs
tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet
countless businesses have been unable to get the loans they need and many have been forced to shut their doors
and although the economy is growing again, too many people are still feeling the pain of the downturn
now, while a number of factors led to such a severe recession, the primary cause was a breakdown in our financial system
it was a crisis born of a failure of responsibility from certain corners of wall street to the halls of power in washington
for years, our financial sector was governed by antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the system and take risks that endangered the entire economy
unscrupulous lenders locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs
firms like aig placed massive, risky bets with borrowed money
and while the rules left abuse and excess unchecked, they also left taxpayers on the hook if a big bank or financial institution ever failed
now, even before the crisis hit, i went to wall street and i called for common-sense reforms to protect consumers and our economy as a whole
and soon after taking office, i proposed a set of reforms to empower consumers and investors, to bring the shadowy deals that caused this crisis into the light of day, and to put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all
today, thanks to a lot of people in this room, those reforms will become the law of the land
for the last year, chairmen barney frank and chris dodd have worked day and night
barney and chris have worked day and night to bring about this reform
and i am profoundly grateful to them
i would be remiss if i didn't also express my appreciation to senator harry reid and speaker nancy pelosi for their leadership
it wouldn't have happened without them
passing this bill was no easy task
to get there, we had to overcome the furious lobbying of an array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to block change
so the members who are here today, both on the stage and in the audience, they have done a great service in devoting so much time and expertise to this effort, to looking out for the public interests and not the special interests
and i also want to thank the three republican senators who put partisanship aside, judged this bill on the merits, and voted for reform
we're grateful to them
and the republican house members
good to see you, joe
now, let's put this in perspective
the fact is, the financial industry is central to our nation's ability to grow, to prosper, to compete and to innovate
there are a lot of banks that understand and fulfill this vital role, and there are a whole lot of bankers who want to do right   and do right   by their customers
this reform will help foster innovation, not hamper it
it is designed to make sure that everybody follows the same set of rules, so that firms compete on price and quality, not on tricks and not on traps
it demands accountability and responsibility from everyone
it provides certainty to everybody, from bankers to farmers to business owners to consumers
and unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers, you've got nothing to fear from reform
now, for all those americans who are wondering what wall street reform means for you, here's what you can expect
if you've ever applied for a credit card, a student loan, or a mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name to pages of barely understandable fine print
what often happens as a result is that many americans are caught by hidden fees and penalties, or saddled with loans they can't afford
that's what happened to robin fox, hit with a massive rate increase on her credit card balance even though she paid her bills on time
that's what happened to andrew giordano, who discovered hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees on his bank statement –- fees he had no idea he might face
both are here today
well, with this law, unfair rate hikes, like the one that hit robin, will end for good
and we'll ensure that people like andrew aren't unwittingly caught by overdraft fees when they sign up for a checking account
with this law, we'll crack down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry
we'll make sure that contracts are simpler -– putting an end to many hidden penalties and fees in complex mortgages -– so folks know what they're signing
with this law, students who take out college loans will be provided clear and concise information about their obligations
and with this law, ordinary investors -– like seniors and folks saving for retirement –- will be able to receive more information about the costs and risks of mutual funds and other investment products, so that they can make better financial decisions as to what will work for them
so, all told, these reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history
in history
and these protections will be enforced by a new consumer watchdog with just one job
looking out for people -– not big banks, not lenders, not investment houses -– looking out for people as they interact with the financial system
and that's not just good for consumers
that's good for the economy
because reform will put a stop to a lot of the bad loans that fueled a debt-based bubble
and it will mean all companies will have to seek customers by offering better products, instead of more deceptive ones
now, beyond the consumer protections i've outlined, reform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system
it will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis
shareholders will also have a greater say on the pay of ceos and other executives, so they can reward success instead of failure
and finally, because of this law, the american people will never again be asked to foot the bill for wall street's mistakes
there will be no more tax-funded bailouts   period
if a large financial institution should ever fail, this reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy
and there will be new rules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is too big to fail, so we don't have another aig
that's what this reform will mean
now, it doesn't mean our work is over
for these new rules to be effective, regulators will have to be vigilant
we may need to make adjustments along the way as our financial system adapts to these new changes and changes around the globe
no law can force anybody to be responsible
it's still incumbent on those on wall street to heed the lessons of this crisis in terms of how they conduct their businesses
the fact is every american -– from main street to wall street –- has a stake in our financial system
wall street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it possible for start-ups to sell new products
they provide loans to businesses to expand and to hire
they back mortgages for families purchasing a new home
that's why we'll all stand to gain from these reforms
we all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets
we all win when shareholders have more power and more information
we all win when consumers are protected against abuse
and we all win when folks are rewarded based on how well they perform, not how well they evade accountability
in the end, our financial system only works –- our market is only free –- when there are clear rules and basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excess, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system
and that's what these reforms are designed to achieve   no more, no less
because that's how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers, that it works for investors, that it works for financial institutions -– that it works for all of us
this is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history
ultimately, there's no dividing line between main street and wall street
we rise or fall together as one nation
so these reforms will help lift our economy and lead all of us to a stronger, more prosperous future
and that's why i'm so honored to sign these reforms into law, and i'm so grateful to everybody who worked so hard to make this day possible
thank you very much, everybody
to mona and marjorie, and to senator byrd's entire family, including those adorable great granddaughters that i had a chance to meet   michelle and i offer you our deepest sympathies
to senator byrd's friends, including the speaker of the house, the majority leader, the republican leader, president clinton, vice president biden, vicki kennedy, nick rahall and all the previous speakers
senator rockefeller for the outstanding work that you've done for the state of west virginia
to his larger family   the people of west virginia   i want you all to know that all america shares your loss
may we all find comfort in a verse of scripture that reminds me of our dear friend
the time of my departure has come
i have fought the good fight, i have finished the race, i have kept the faith
it's interesting that you've heard that passage from several speakers now, because it embodies somebody who knew how to run a good and long race, and somebody who knew how to keep the faith   with his state, with his family, with his country and his constitution
years from now, when i think of the man we memorialize today, i'll remember him as he was when i came to know him, his white hair full like a mane, his gait steadied with a cane
determined to make the most of every last breath, the distinguished gentleman from west virginia could be found at his desk until the very end, doing the people's business, delivering soul-stirring speeches, a hint of the appalachians in his voice, stabbing the air with his finger, fiery as ever, years into his 10th decade
he was a senate icon
he was a party leader
he was an elder statesman
and he was my friend
that's how i'll remember him
today we remember the path he climbed to such extraordinary peaks
born cornelius calvin sale, jr
corny, he joked, for short   his mother lost her life in the great influenza pandemic of 1918
from the aunt and uncle who raised him, amid west virginia's coal camps, he gained not only his byrd name but a reverence for god almighty, a love of learning that was nurtured at mark twain school
and there he met erma, his sweetheart for over 70 years, by whose side he will now rest for eternity
unable to afford college, he did what he could to get by, finding work as a gas station attendant, a produce salesman, a meat-cutter, and a welder in the shipyards of baltimore and tampa during world war ii
returning home to west virginia after the war, he ran for the state house of delegates, using his fiddle case as a briefcase, the better to stand out on the stump
before long, he ran for congress, serving in the house before jumping over to the senate, where he was elected nine times, held almost every leadership role imaginable, and proved as capable of swaying others as standing alone, marking a row of milestones along the way
longest-serving member of congress
nearly 19,000 votes cast
not a single loss at the polls   a record that speaks to the bond that he had with you, the people of his state
transplanted to washington, his heart remained here, in west virginia, in the place that shaped him, with the people he loved
his heart belonged to you
making life better here was his only agenda
giving you hope, he said, was his greatest achievement
hope in the form of new jobs and industries
hope in the form of black lung benefits and union protections
hope through roads and research centers, schools and scholarships, health clinics and industrial parks that bear his name
his early rival and late friend, ted kennedy, used to joke about campaigning in west virginia
when his bus broke down, ted got hold of the highway patrol, who asked where he was
and he said, i'm on robert byrd highway
and the dispatcher said, which one
it's a life that immeasurably improved the lives of west virginians
of course, robert byrd was a deeply religious man, a christian
and so he understood that our lives are marked by sins as well as virtues, failures as well as success, weakness as well as strength
we know there are things he said   and things he did   that he came to regret
i remember talking about that the first time i visited with him
he said, there are things i regretted in my youth
you may know that
and i said, none of us are absent some regrets, senator
that's why we enjoy and seek the grace of god
and as i reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice
like the constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, robert byrd possessed that quintessential american quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect
over his nearly six decades in our capitol, he came to be seen as the very embodiment of the senate, chronicling its history in four volumes that he gave to me just as he gave to president clinton
i, too, read it
i was scared he was going to quiz me
but as i soon discovered, his passion for the senate's past, his mastery of even its most arcane procedures, it wasn't an obsession with the trivial or the obscure
it reflected a profoundly noble impulse, a recognition of a basic truth about this country that we are not a nation of men, we are a nation of laws
our way of life rests on our democratic institutions
precisely because we are fallible, it falls to each of us to safeguard these institutions, even when it's inconvenient, and pass on our republic more perfect than before
considering the vast learning of this self-taught senator   his speeches sprinkled with the likes of cicero and shakespeare and jefferson   it seems fitting to close with one of his favorite passages in literature, a passage from moby dick
and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces
and even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains
so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than any other bird upon the plain, even though they soar
robert byrd was a mountain eagle, and his lowest swoop was still higher than the other birds upon the plain
may god bless robert c
byrd
may he be welcomed kindly by the righteous judge
and may his spirit soar forever like a catskill eagle, high above the heavens
thank you very much
thank you
everyone please have a seat
thank you very much
let   let me thank pastor hybels from near my hometown in chicago, who took time off his vacation to be here today
we are blessed to have him
i want to thank president neil kerwin and our hosts here at american university
acknowledge my outstanding secretary of labor, hilda solis, and members of my administration
all the members of congress   hilda deserves applause
to all the members of congress, the elected officials, faith and law enforcement, labor, business leaders and immigration advocates who are here today   thank you for your presence
i want to thank american university for welcoming me to the campus once again
some may recall that the last time i was here i was joined by a dear friend, and a giant of american politics, senator edward kennedy
teddy's not here right now, but his legacy of civil rights and health care and worker protections is still with us
i was a candidate for president that day, and some may recall i argued that our country had reached a tipping point
that after years in which we had deferred our most pressing problems, and too often yielded to the politics of the moment, we now faced a choice
we could squarely confront our challenges with honesty and determination, or we could consign ourselves and our children to a future less prosperous and less secure
i believed that then and i believe it now
and that's why, even as we've tackled the most severe economic crisis since the great depression, even as we've wound down the war in iraq and refocused our efforts in afghanistan, my administration has refused to ignore some of the fundamental challenges facing this generation
we launched the most aggressive education reforms in decades, so that our children can gain the knowledge and skills they need to compete in a 21st century global economy
we have finally delivered on the promise of health reform   reform that will bring greater security to every american, and that will rein in the skyrocketing costs that threaten families, businesses and the prosperity of our nation
we're on the verge of reforming an outdated and ineffective set of rules governing wall street   to give greater power to consumers and prevent the reckless financial speculation that led to this severe recession
and we're accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy by significantly raising the fuel-efficiency standards of cars and trucks, and by doubling our use of renewable energies like wind and solar power   steps that have the potential to create whole new industries and hundreds of thousands of new jobs in america
so, despite the forces of the status quo, despite the polarization and the frequent pettiness of our politics, we are confronting the great challenges of our times
and while this work isn't easy, and the changes we seek won't always happen overnight, what we've made clear is that this administration will not just kick the can down the road
immigration reform is no exception
in recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in arizona and the heated reactions we've seen across america
some have rallied behind this new policy
others have protested and launched boycotts of the state
and everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken
of course, the tensions around immigration are not new
on the one hand, we've always defined ourselves as a nation of immigrants   a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace america's precepts
indeed, it is this constant flow of immigrants that helped to make america what it is
the scientific breakthroughs of albert einstein, the inventions of nikola tesla, the great ventures of andrew carnegie's u
steel and sergey brin's google, inc
all this was possible because of immigrants
and then there are the countless names and the quiet acts that never made the history books but were no less consequential in building this country   the generations who braved hardship and great risk to reach our shores in search of a better life for themselves and their families
the millions of people, ancestors to most of us, who believed that there was a place where they could be, at long last, free to work and worship and live their lives in peace
so this steady stream of hardworking and talented people has made america the engine of the global economy and a beacon of hope around the world
and it's allowed us to adapt and thrive in the face of technological and societal change
to this day, america reaps incredible economic rewards because we remain a magnet for the best and brightest from across the globe
folks travel here in the hopes of being a part of a culture of entrepreneurship and ingenuity, and by doing so they strengthen and enrich that culture
immigration also means we have a younger workforce   and a faster-growing economy   than many of our competitors
and in an increasingly interconnected world, the diversity of our country is a powerful advantage in global competition
just a few weeks ago, we had an event of small business owners at the white house
and one business owner was a woman named prachee devadas who came to this country, became a citizen, and opened up a successful technology services company
when she started, she had just one employee
today, she employs more than a hundred people
this past april, we held a naturalization ceremony at the white house for members of our armed forces
even though they were not yet citizens, they had enlisted
one of them was a woman named perla ramos   born and raised in mexico, came to the united states shortly after 9/11, and she eventually joined the navy
and she said, i take pride in our flag and the history that forged this great nation and the history we write day by day
these women, and men and women across this country like them, remind us that immigrants have always helped to build and defend this country   and that being an american is not a matter of blood or birth
it's a matter of faith
it's a matter of fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so dear
that's what makes us unique
that's what makes us strong
anybody can help us write the next great chapter in our history
now, we can't forget that this process of immigration and eventual inclusion has often been painful
each new wave of immigrants has generated fear and resentments towards newcomers, particularly in times of economic upheaval
our founding was rooted in the notion that america was unique as a place of refuge and freedom for, in thomas jefferson's words, oppressed humanity
but the ink on our constitution was barely dry when, amidst conflict, congress passed the alien and sedition acts, which placed harsh restrictions of those suspected of having foreign allegiances
a century ago, immigrants from ireland, italy, poland, other european countries were routinely subjected to rank discrimination and ugly stereotypes
chinese immigrants were held in detention and deported from angel island in the san francisco bay
they didn't even get to come in
so the politics of who is and who is not allowed to enter this country, and on what terms, has always been contentious
and that remains true today
and it's made worse by a failure of those of us in washington to fix a broken immigration system
to begin with, our borders have been porous for decades
obviously, the problem is greatest along our southern border, but it's not restricted to that part of the country
in fact, because we don't do a very good job of tracking who comes in and out of the country as visitors, large numbers avoid immigration laws simply by overstaying their visas
the result is an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states
the overwhelming majority of these men and women are simply seeking a better life for themselves and their children
many settle in low-wage sectors of the economy
they work hard, they save, they stay out of trouble
but because they live in the shadows, they're vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses who pay them less than the minimum wage or violate worker safety rules   thereby putting companies who follow those rules, and americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime, at an unfair advantage
crimes go unreported as victims and witnesses fear coming forward
and this makes it harder for the police to catch violent criminals and keep neighborhoods safe
and billions in tax revenue are lost each year because many undocumented workers are paid under the table
more fundamentally, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigrating legally
indeed, after years of patchwork fixes and ill-conceived revisions, the legal immigration system is as broken as the borders
backlogs and bureaucracy means the process can take years
while an applicant waits for approval, he or she is often forbidden from visiting the united states   which means even husbands and wives may be forced to spend many years apart
high fees and the need for lawyers may exclude worthy applicants
and while we provide students from around the world visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities, our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or power a new industry right here in the united states
instead of training entrepreneurs to create jobs on our shores, we train our competition
in sum, the system is broken
and everybody knows it
unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling   and to the pervasive sentiment in washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics
just a few years ago, when i was a senator, we forged a bipartisan coalition in favor of comprehensive reform
under the leadership of senator kennedy, who had been a longtime champion of immigration reform, and senator john mccain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan bill through the senate
but that effort eventually came apart
and now, under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support
into this breach, states like arizona have decided to take matters into their own hands
given the levels of frustration across the country, this is understandable
but it is also ill conceived
and it's not just that the law arizona passed is divisive   although it has fanned the flames of an already contentious debate
laws like arizona's put huge pressures on local law enforcement to enforce rules that ultimately are unenforceable
it puts pressure on already hard-strapped state and local budgets
it makes it difficult for people here illegally to report crimes   driving a wedge between communities and law enforcement, making our streets more dangerous and the jobs of our police officers more difficult
and you don't have to take my word for this
you can speak to the police chiefs and others from law enforcement here today who will tell you the same thing
these laws also have the potential of violating the rights of innocent american citizens and legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound
and as other states and localities go their own ways, we face the prospect that different rules for immigration will apply in different parts of the country   a patchwork of local immigration rules where we all know one clear national standard is needed
our task then is to make our national laws actually work   to shape a system that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants
and that means being honest about the problem, and getting past the false debates that divide the country rather than bring it together
for example, there are those in the immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are  illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws
and often this argument is framed in moral terms
why should we punish people who are just trying to earn a living
i recognize the sense of compassion that drives this argument, but i believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair
it would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision
and this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration
and it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally
ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship
and no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable
now, if the majority of americans are skeptical of a blanket amnesty, they are also skeptical that it is possible to round up and deport 11 million people
they know it's not possible
such an effort would be logistically impossible and wildly expensive
moreover, it would tear at the very fabric of this nation   because immigrants who are here illegally are now intricately woven into that fabric
many have children who are american citizens
some are children themselves, brought here by their parents at a very young age, growing up as american kids, only to discover their illegal status when they apply for college or a job
migrant workers   mostly here illegally   have been the labor force of our farmers and agricultural producers for generations
so even if it was possible, a program of mass deportations would disrupt our economy and communities in ways that most americans would find intolerable
now, once we get past the two poles of this debate, it becomes possible to shape a practical, common-sense approach that reflects our heritage and our values
such an approach demands accountability from everybody   from government, from businesses and from individuals
government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders
that's why i directed my secretary of homeland security, janet napolitano   a former border governor   to improve our enforcement policy without having to wait for a new law
today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history
let me repeat that
we have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history
we doubled the personnel assigned to border enforcement security task forces
we tripled the number of intelligence analysts along the border
for the first time, we've begun screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments
and as a result, we're seizing more illegal guns, cash and drugs than in years past
contrary to some of the reports that you see, crime along the border is down
and statistics collected by customs and border protection reflect a significant reduction in the number of people trying to cross the border illegally
so the bottom line is this
the southern border is more secure today than at any time in the past 20 years
that doesn't mean we don't have more work to do
we have to do that work, but it's important that we acknowledge the facts
even as we are committed to doing what's necessary to secure our borders, even without passage of the new law, there are those who argue that we should not move forward with any other elements of reform until we have fully sealed our borders
but our borders are just too vast for us to be able to solve the problem only with fences and border patrols
it won't work
our borders will not be secure as long as our limited resources are devoted to not only stopping gangs and potential terrorists, but also the hundreds of thousands who attempt to cross each year simply to find work
that's why businesses must be held accountable if they break the law by deliberately hiring and exploiting undocumented workers
we've already begun to step up enforcement against the worst workplace offenders
and we're implementing and improving a system to give employers a reliable way to verify that their employees are here legally
but we need to do more
we cannot continue just to look the other way as a significant portion of our economy operates outside the law
it breeds abuse and bad practices
it punishes employers who act responsibly and undercuts american workers
and ultimately, if the demand for undocumented workers falls, the incentive for people to come here illegally will decline as well
finally, we have to demand responsibility from people living here illegally
they must be required to admit that they broke the law
they should be required to register, pay their taxes, pay a fine, and learn english
they must get right with the law before they can get in line and earn their citizenship   not just because it is fair, not just because it will make clear to those who might wish to come to america they must do so inside the bounds of the law, but because this is how we demonstrate that being   what being an american means
being a citizen of this country comes not only with rights but also with certain fundamental responsibilities
we can create a pathway for legal status that is fair, reflective of our values, and works
now, stopping illegal immigration must go hand in hand with reforming our creaky system of legal immigration
we've begun to do that, by eliminating a backlog in background checks that at one point stretched back almost a year
that's just for the background check
people can now track the status of their immigration applications by email or text message
we've improved accountability and safety in the detention system
and we've stemmed the increases in naturalization fees
but here, too, we need to do more
we should make it easier for the best and the brightest to come to start businesses and develop products and create jobs
our laws should respect families following the rules   instead of splitting them apart
we need to provide farms a legal way to hire the workers they rely on, and a path for those workers to earn legal status
and we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents by denying them the chance to stay here and earn an education and contribute their talents to build the country where they've grown up
the dream act would do this, and that's why i supported this bill as a state legislator and as a u
senator   and why i continue to support it as president
so these are the essential elements of comprehensive immigration reform
the question now is whether we will have the courage and the political will to pass a bill through congress, to finally get it done
last summer, i held a meeting with leaders of both parties, including many of the republicans who had supported reform in the past   and some who hadn't
i was pleased to see a bipartisan framework proposed in the senate by senators lindsey graham and chuck schumer, with whom i met to discuss this issue
i've spoken with the congressional hispanic caucus to plot the way forward and meet   and then i met with them earlier this week
and i've spoken with representatives from a growing coalition of labor unions and business groups, immigrant advocates and community organizations, law enforcement, local government   all who recognize the importance of immigration reform
and i've met with leaders from america's religious communities, like pastor hybels   people of different faiths and beliefs, some liberal, some conservative, who nonetheless share a sense of urgency
who understand that fixing our broken immigration system is not only a political issue, not just an economic issue, but a moral imperative as well
so we've made progress
i'm ready to move forward
the majority of democrats are ready to move forward
and i believe the majority of americans are ready to move forward
but the fact is, without bipartisan support, as we had just a few years ago, we cannot solve this problem
reform that brings accountability to our immigration system cannot pass without republican votes
that is the political and mathematical reality
the only way to reduce the risk that this effort will again falter because of politics is if members of both parties are willing to take responsibility for solving this problem once and for all
and, yes, this is an emotional question, and one that lends itself to demagoguery
time and again, this issue has been used to divide and inflame   and to demonize people
and so the understandable, the natural impulse among those who run for office is to turn away and defer this question for another day, or another year, or another administration
despite the courageous leadership in the past shown by many democrats and some republicans   including, by the way, my predecessor, president bush   this has been the custom
that is why a broken and dangerous system that offends our most basic american values is still in place
but i believe we can put politics aside and finally have an immigration system that's accountable
i believe we can appeal not to people's fears but to their hopes, to their highest ideals, because that's who we are as americans
it's been inscribed on our nation's seal since we declared our independence
e pluribus unum
out of many, one
that is what has drawn the persecuted and impoverished to our shores
that's what led the innovators and risk-takers from around the world to take a chance here in the land of opportunity
that's what has led people to endure untold hardships to reach this place called america
one of the largest waves of immigration in our history took place little more than a century ago
at the time, jewish people were being driven out of eastern europe, often escaping to the sounds of gunfire and the light from their villages burning to the ground
the journey could take months, as families crossed rivers in the dead of night, traveled miles by foot, endured a rough and dangerous passage over the north atlantic
once here, many made their homes in a teeming and bustling lower manhattan
it was at this time that a young woman named emma lazarus, whose own family fled persecution from europe generations earlier, took up the cause of these new immigrants
although she was a poet, she spent much of her time advocating for better health care and housing for the newcomers
and inspired by what she saw and heard, she wrote down her thoughts and donated a piece of work to help pay for the construction of a new statue   the statue of liberty   which actually was funded in part by small donations from people across america
years before the statue was built   years before it would be seen by throngs of immigrants craning their necks skyward at the end of long and brutal voyage, years before it would come to symbolize everything that we cherish   she imagined what it could mean
she imagined the sight of a giant statue at the entry point of a great nation   but unlike the great monuments of the past, this would not signal an empire
instead, it would signal one's arrival to a place of opportunity and refuge and freedom
here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand, she wrote,
a mighty woman with a torch…
from her beacon-hand
glows world-wide welcome…
keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp
give me your tired, and your poor,
your huddled masses yearning to be free…
send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,
i lift my lamp beside the golden door
let us remember these words
for it falls on each generation to ensure that that lamp   that beacon   continues to shine as a source of hope around the world, and a source of our prosperity here at home
thank you
god bless you
and may god bless the united states of america
thank you
good afternoon
today i accepted general stanley mcchrystal's resignation as commander of the international security assistance force in afghanistan
i did so with considerable regret, but also with certainty that it is the right thing for our mission in afghanistan, for our military, and for our country
i'm also pleased to nominate general david petraeus to take command in afghanistan which will allows us to maintain the momentum and leadership that we need to succeed
i don't make this decision based on any difference in policy with general mcchrystal, as we are in full agreement about our strategy
nor do i make this decision out of any sense of personal insult
stan mcchrystal has always shown great courtesy and carried out my orders faithfully
i've got great admiration for him and for his long record of service in uniform
over the last nine years, with america fighting wars in iraq and afghanistan, he has earned a reputation as one of our nation's finest soldiers
that reputation is founded upon his extraordinary dedication, his deep intelligence and his love of country
i've relied on his service, particularly in helping to design and lead our new strategy in afghanistan
so all americans should be grateful for general mcchrystal's remarkable career in uniform
but war is bigger than any one man or woman, whether a private, a general or a president
and as difficult as it is to lose general mcchrystal, i believe that it is the right decision for our national security
the conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general
it undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system
and it erodes the trust that's necessary for our team to work together to achieve our objectives in afghanistan
my multiple responsibilities as commander-in-chief led me to this decision
first, i have a responsibility to the extraordinary men and women who are fighting this war and to the democratic institutions that i've been elected to lead
i've got no greater honor than serving as commander-in-chief of our men and women in uniform
and it is my duty to ensure that no diversion complicates the vital mission that they are carrying out
that includes adherence to a strict code of conduct
the strength and greatness of our military is rooted in the fact that this code applies equally to newly enlisted privates and to the general officer who commands them
that allows us to come together as one
that's part of the reason why america has the finest fighting force in the history of the world
it is also true that our democracy depends upon institutions that are stronger than individuals
that includes strict adherence to the military chain of command and respect for civilian control over that chain of command
and that's why as commander-in-chief i believe this decision is necessary to hold ourselves accountable to standards that are at the core of our democracy
second, i have a responsibility to do whatever is necessary to succeed in afghanistan and in our broader effort to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al qaida
i believe that this mission demands unity of effort across our alliance and across my national security team
and i don't think that we can sustain that unity of effort and achieve our objectives in afghanistan without making this change
that, too, has guided my decision
i've just told my national security team that now is the time for all of us to come together
doing so is not an option but an obligation
i welcome debate among my team, but i won't tolerate division
all of us have personal interests
all of us have opinions
our politics often fuels conflict
but we have to renew our sense of common purpose and meet our responsibilities to one another, and to our troops who are in harm's way and to our country
we need to remember what this is all about
our nation is at war
we face a very tough fight in afghanistan
but americans don't flinch in the face of difficult truths or difficult tasks
we persist and we persevere
we will not tolerate a safe haven for terrorists who want to destroy afghan society from within and launch attacks against innocent men, women and children in our country and around the world
so make no mistake, we have a clear goal
we are going to break the taliban's momentum
we are going to build afghan capacity
we are going to relentlessly apply pressure on al qaida and its leadership, strengthening the ability of both afghanistan and pakistan to do the same
that's the strategy that we agreed to last fall
that is the policy that we are carrying out in afghanistan and pakistan
in that effort, we are honored to be joined by allies and partners who have stood by us and paid the ultimate price through the loss of their young people at war
they are with us because the interests and values that we share, and because this mission is fundamental to the ability of free people to live in peace and security in the 21st century
and general petraeus and i were able to spend some time this morning discussing the way forward
i'm extraordinarily grateful that he has agreed to serve in this new capacity
it should be clear to everybody he does so at great personal sacrifice to himself and to his family
and he is setting an extraordinary example of service and patriotism by assuming this difficult post
let me say to the american people, this is a change in personnel, but it is not a change in policy
general petraeus fully participated in our review last fall
and he both supported and helped design the strategy that we have in place
in his current post at central command, he was worked closely with our forces in afghanistan
he has worked closely with congress
he has worked closely with the afghan and pakistan governments, and with all our partners in the region
he has my full confidence
and i am urging the senate to confirm him for this new assignment as swiftly as possible
let me conclude by saying that it was a difficult decision to come to the conclusion that i've made today
indeed, it saddens me to lose the service of a soldier who i've come to respect and admire
but the reasons that led me to this decision are the same principles that have supported the strength of our military and our nation since the founding
so, once again, i thank general mcchrystal for his enormous contributions to the security of this nation and to the success of our mission in afghanistan
i look forward to working with general petraeus and my entire national security team to succeed in our mission
and i reaffirm that america stands as one in our support for the men and women who defend it
thank you very much
hello
hello, everybody
thank you so much
thank you
thank you very much
everybody, please have a seat
thank you very much
thank you
let me just begin by making a few acknowledgements
first of all, i've got some outstanding fathers here in the first row who aren't seeing their kids enough because i'm working them all the time   three members of my cabinet
secretary of the treasury tim geithner    attorney general eric holder   and secretary of commerce gary locke are here
in addition, we've got one of my heroes and i'm sure one of yours, somebody whose shoulders i stand on and allowed me to become president of the united states, and that's congressman from the great state of georgia, john lewis, is here
a fierce advocate on behalf of the district of columbia, congresswoman eleanor holmes norton is here
i want to acknowledge the mayor of washington, d
, adrian fenty in the house
the executive director of arc, edmund fleet, is here
i want to thank all the panel discussion participants who are involved in today's events, and i want to thank nurney mason   a washington, d
icon
nurney founded mason's barbershop in 1961
that's the year i was born
it's still going strong
he is here with his children and his grandchildren
where is he
there he is right there
i could use a little trim
one year ago this week, we kicked off a national conversation on fatherhood and personal responsibility, and members of our administration fanned out all across the country to hear from fathers and families about the challenges that they face
secretary arne duncan, our secretary of education, held a discussion in new hampshire about the link between fatherhood and educational achievement
gary locke talked to fathers in california about balancing the needs of their families with the demands of their jobs
secretary shinseki, of veterans affairs, held a town hall for military and veteran dads in north carolina
and attorney general holder traveled to georgia for a forum about fathers in our criminal justice system
and in each of these places, each of these leaders posed a simple question
how can we as a nation   not just the government, but businesses and community groups and concerned citizens   how can we all come together to help fathers meet their responsibilities to our families and communities
and we did this because we know the vital role fathers play in the lives of our children
fathers are our first teachers and coaches   or in my house, assistant teachers and assistant coaches   (laughter)   to mom
but they're our mentors, our role models
they show us by the example they set the kind of people they want us to become
but we also know that what too many fathers being absent means   too many fathers missing from too many homes, missing from too many lives
we know that when fathers abandon their responsibilities, there's harm done to those kids
we know that children who grow up without a father are more likely to live in poverty
they're more likely to drop out of school
they're more likely to wind up in prison
they're more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol
they're more likely to run away from home
they're more likely to become teenage parents themselves
and i say all this as someone who grew up without a father in my own life
he left my family when i was two years old
and while i was lucky to have a wonderful mother and loving grandparents who poured everything they had into me and my sister, i still felt the weight of that absence
it's something that leaves a hole in a child's life that no government can fill
so we can talk all we want here in washington about issues like education and health care and crime
we can build good schools
we can put money into creating good jobs
we can do everything we can to keep our streets safe   but government can't keep our kids from looking for trouble on those streets
government can't force a kid to pick up a book or make sure that the homework gets done
government can't be there day in, day out, to provide discipline and guidance and the love that it takes to raise a child
that's our job as fathers, as mothers, as guardians for our children
the fact is, it's easy to become a father, technically   any guy can do that
it's hard to live up to the lifelong responsibilities that come with fatherhood
and it's a challenge even in good times, when our families are doing well
it's especially difficult when times are tough, families are straining just to keep everything together
in a time of war, many of our military families are stretched thin, with fathers doing multiple tours of duty far away from their children
in difficult economic times, a lot of fathers are worried about whether they're going to be able to keep their job, or find a job, or whether they'll be able to pay the bills and give their children the kinds of opportunities that if they didn't have them themselves, at least they wished for their children
and there are a lot of men who are out of work and wrestling with the shame and frustration that comes when you feel like you can't be the kind of provider you want to be for the people that you love
but here's the key message i think all of us want to send today to fathers all across the country
our children don't need us to be superheroes
they don't need us to be perfect
they do need us to be present
they need us to show up and give it our best shot, no matter what else is going on in our lives
they need us to show them   not just with words, but with deeds   that they, those kids, are always our first priority
those family meals, afternoons in the park, bedtime stories
the encouragement we give, the questions we answer, the limits we set, the example we set of persistence in the face of difficulty and hardship   those things add up over time, and they shape a child's character, build their core, teach them to trust in life and to enter into it with confidence and with hope and with determination
and that's something they'll always carry with them
that love that we show not with money, or fame, or spectacular feats, but through small daily acts   the love we show and that we earn by being present in the lives of our children
now, unfortunately, the way we talk about fatherhood in this country doesn't always reinforce these truths
when we talk about issues like child care and work-family balance, we call them women's issues and mothers' issues
too often when we talk about fatherhood and personal responsibility, we talk about it in political terms, in terms of left and right, conservative/liberal, instead of what's right and what's wrong
and when we do that, we've gotten off track
so i think it's time for a new conversation around fatherhood in this country
we can all agree that we've got too many mothers out there forced to do everything all by themselves
they're doing a heroic job, often under trying circumstances
they deserve a lot of credit for that
but they shouldn't have to do it alone
the work of raising our children is the most important job in this country, and it's all of our responsibilities   mothers and fathers
now, i can't legislate fatherhood   i can't force anybody to love a child
but what we can do is send a clear message to our fathers that there is no excuse for failing to meet their obligations
what we can do is make it easier for fathers who make responsible choices and harder for those who avoid those choices
what we can do is come together and support fathers who are willing to step up and be good partners and parents and providers
and that's why today we're launching the next phase of our work to promote responsible fatherhood   a new, nationwide fatherhood and mentoring initiative
this is a call to action with cities and states, with individuals and organizations across the country   from the nfl players association to the national pta, to everyday moms and dads   we're raising awareness about responsible fatherhood and working to re-engage absent fathers with their families
as part of this effort, we've proposed a new and expanded fatherhood, marriage and families innovation fund
and we plan to seek out and support the very best, most successful initiatives in our states and communities   those that are offering services like job training, or parenting skills classes, domestic violence prevention   all which help provide the kind of network of support for men, particularly those in vulnerable communities
we're also going to help dads who get caught up   we want to make sure that they're caught up on child support payments and that we re-engage them in their children's lives
we're going to support efforts to build healthy relationships between parents as well   because we know that children benefit not just from loving mothers and loving fathers, but from strong and loving marriages as well
we're also launching a new transitional jobs initiative for ex-offenders and low-income, non-custodial fathers   because these are men who often face serious barriers to finding work and keeping work
we'll help them develop the skills and experience they need to move into full-time, long-term employment, so they can meet their child support obligations and help provide for their families
and under eric holder's direction, our justice department is planning to create its first fathering re-entry court for ex-offender dads   and to help replicate this program in courts across the country
the idea here is very simple
to reach fathers right as they're leaving the criminal justice system and connect them immediately to the employment and services they need to start making their child support payments and reconnecting them with their families
this program was inspired by leaders like peter spokes, who was the executive director of the national center for fathering   a good friend to many in our administration, all of whom were deeply saddened by his recent passing
and we are honored to have peter's wife, barbara, with us here today
where's barbara
i just saw her earlier
there she is
thank you
so these initiatives are a good start
but ultimately, we know that the decision to be a good father   that's up to us, each of us, as individuals
it's one that men across this country are making every single day   attending those school assemblies
parent-teacher conferences
coaching soccer, little league
scrimping and saving, and working that extra shift so that their children can go to college
and plenty of fathers   and men who aren't fathers as well   are stepping up to serve as mentors and tutors and big brothers and foster parents to young people who don't have any responsible adult in their lives
even when we give it our best efforts, there will still be plenty of days of struggle and heartache when we don't quite measure up   talking to the men here now
even with all the good fortune and support michelle and i have had in our lives, i've made plenty of mistakes as a parent
i've lost count of all the times when the demands of work have taken me from the duties of fatherhood
and i know i've missed out on moments in my daughters' lives that i'll never get back, and that's a loss that's hard to accept
but i also know the feeling that one author described when she wrote that to have a child…is to decide forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body
think about that   to have a child is to have your heart walking around outside your body
i'm sure a lot of fathers here know that same memory that i have, of driving home with michelle and malia right after she was born, going about 10 miles an hour
your emotions swinging between unadulterated joy and sheer terror
and i made a pledge that day that i would do everything i could to give my daughter what i never had   that if i could be anything in life, i would be a good father
and like a lot of the men here, since that time i've found there's nothing else in my life that compares to the pleasures i take in spending time with my girls
nothing else comes close to the pride i feel in their achievement and the satisfaction i get in watching them grow into strong, confident young women
over the course of my life, i have been an attorney, i've been a professor, i've been a state senator, i've been a u
senator   and i currently am serving as president of the united states
but i can say without hesitation that the most challenging, most fulfilling, most important job i will have during my time on this earth is to be sasha and malia's dad
so you don't need a fancy degree for that
you don't need a lot of money for that
no matter what doubts we may feel, what difficulties we may face, we all have to remember being a father   it's not just an obligation and a responsibility
it is a privilege and a blessing, one that we all have to embrace as individuals and as a nation
so, happy father's day, everybody
god bless you
god bless the united states of america
hello, everybody
all right, everybody have a seat
i got a lot to say here
first of all, i want to just thank becky patton for the extraordinary work that she has done on behalf of nurses, on behalf of patients, on behalf of the country
thank you so much
we are proud of everything that she's done
and her mom is in the house   so, thanks, mom
good job
good job with becky
i want to thank marla weston, the ceo of the american nurses association
and i also want to acknowledge the presence here of dr
mary wakefield, who is our   for those of you who are not familiar, she is the administrator of hrsa and our highest-ranking nurse in the administration   and does absolutely great work
now, i want to tell you, it is an honor to speak to the ana, representing more than 3 million registered nurses across the country
part of the reason i'm here is because i promised i was going to come, and i told to becky that i don't break promises to nurses because you never know when i'm going to need a shot
and i don't want them working that needle all kind of   i can't find a vein
so i'm keeping my promises
but it's not just out of fear
it's also because i love nurses
i love nurses
now, i'm not just saying that because i'm talking to a roomful of nurses
there are representatives from illinois here in the house   and they will testify i loved nurses before i got to washington
and i don't think i'm alone in that, because virtually all of us, at one time or another in our lives, have known the care and the skill that you offer
in hours of need, in moments where people are most vulnerable, most worried, nurses are there, doing difficult and lifesaving work
and you don't just provide clean bandages or an intravenous line
a nurse will hold your hand sometime, or offer a voice of calm, or that knowing glance that says things are going to be okay
and when malia was born, i remember vividly the nurses who took care of michelle and our new baby
the doctor who delivered is actually one of our best friends, but she was there about 10 minutes
and the nurse was there the whole time tending to this new family of ours
that was a happy day
now, there was another day when our youngest daughter, sasha   she was three months old   was diagnosed with meningitis
and it was nurses who walked us through what was happening, and who, along with the doctors, helped make sure that sasha was all right and that her father did not have a breakdown
so, as a father, as a husband, i will forever be in debt to the women and men of your profession
and i know that millions of others feel the same way
america's nurses are the beating heart of our medical system
you're on the front lines   you are on the front lines of health care in small clinics and in large hospitals, in rural towns and in big cities, all across america
and it's because you know our health care system so well that you've been such a fierce advocate for its reform
because after all, you care for patients who end up in the emergency room, or in surgery, because they couldn't afford the preventive care that would have made more invasive and costly treatment unnecessary
you are asked not only to take care of patients   you've got to navigate a tangle of rules and forms and paperwork that drive up costs and prevent you from doing the best job possible
you're the ones who see the terror in a parent's eyes when an insurance company bureaucrat has denied coverage for a child's treatment
and you're the ones who have to comfort people who are wracked with worry not only about getting better, but also about paying for health care because they've hit a cap on benefits or their insurance doesn't cover a preexisting condition
so nurses have seen the consequences of our decades-old failure to reform our health care system   the rising costs, the increased uninsured, the mixed up incentives, the overburdened providers, and a complex system that has been working a lot better for insurance companies than it's working for the american people   or for providers
and that's why, almost a year ago, nurses from across the country came to the white house to help make the case for reform   for making coverage more affordable, and extending coverage to millions without it
for giving doctors and nurses more freedom to help their patients
for providing families and small businesses with more control over their health insurance
and for ending the worst and most abusive practices of the insurance industry
and after a long and tough fight, we succeeded   yes, we did   in passing health care reform
thanks to you
and that reform will make a positive difference in the lives of the american people
now, this fight wasn't new for the ana
i understand you were one of the only major health care organizations that supported the creation of medicare from the start
and i want to recognize one of your leaders   jo eleanor elliott of colorado, who is here today and was your president back then   for the courage and leadership she showed
where is she
there you are right there
give her a big round of applause
so you've been there before and you were here this time
and i want to thank the ana for advocating for health care reform   for ensuring that the voices of nurses and of patients were heard
now, already, we're seeing the start of a profound shift as reforms begin to take effect
we're giving ordinary consumers and small businesses more power and protection in the health care system   and we're knocking down barriers that stand between you and the people who you care for
a few weeks ago, 4 million small business owners and organizations got a postcard in their mailbox from the irs
now, usually that's not good news
but this time it was because it told them that they could be eligible for a health care tax cut this year   a tax cut worth potentially tens of thousands of dollars for those small businesses
a tax cut that will help millions to provide coverage to their employees
that's happening now
in many cases, young adults without health insurance are now able to stay on their parents' plan until they're 26 years old
even though insurance companies had until september to comply with this rule, we asked them to do so immediately to avoid coverage gaps for young adults, and most have agreed
starting this month, relief is also available to businesses for providing coverage to retirees who are not yet eligible for medicare
and as of last week, senior citizens who fall into the doughnut hole have started receiving a $250 rebate to help them afford their medication   and we're going to keep on going until we close that doughnut hole completely
in the meantime, we're strengthening medicare by going after the billions of dollars in waste and fraud and abuse in the system
and states like maine and connecticut are beginning to predict budget savings as pieces of reform come online
so we've begun making coverage more affordable
in addition, the new health care law has also started to end the worst insurance industry practices
you know them
for too long, we've been held hostage to an industry that jacks up premiums and drops coverage whenever they please
those days are coming to an end
so after my administration demanded that a large insurance company justify a massive premium increase on californians, the company backed off its plan
my secretary of health and human services, kathleen sebelius, has urged states to investigate other rate hikes
we've set up a new office of consumer information and insurance oversight
and we'll provide grants to states running the best oversight programs to root out bad practices when it comes to premiums
now, as of september, the new health care law prohibits insurance companies from dropping people's coverage when they get sick, which is critical to giving people some peace of mind
but when news reports indicated that an insurance company was dropping the coverage of women diagnosed with breast cancer, my administration called on them to end the practice immediately   don't wait till september
and soon after, the entire industry announced that it would comply with the new law early and stop this perverse practice of dropping people's insurance when they fall ill and when they need coverage the most
some were also questioning whether insurance companies could find a loophole in the new law and continue to discriminate against children with preexisting conditions
so we called on insurance companies to step up, provide coverage to our most vulnerable americans
and the insurance industry has agreed
in just two weeks, americans denied coverage because of preexisting conditions will be able to enroll in a new national insurance pool
and for states that opt to run their own pools   using funds from the new law   we're urging them to begin enrolling people as soon as possible
and these pools are going to provide some short-term relief, but they're temporary
they're going to ensure that folks who have been shut out of the market because they've been sick can access more affordable insurance starting right away
but what we want is these health insurance exchanges up and running in a few years, so that, at that point, this kind of discrimination will finally be banned forever
and that's when those   that's when the millions without coverage, including people with preexisting conditions, will have the access to the same types of insurance plans that members of congress get
and you know those must be pretty good
we're also going to be putting in place a patient's bill of rights that will tell insurance companies that they can't put a restrictive limit on the amount of coverage you get in your lifetime, or in a given year
it will prevent insurance companies from rescinding your coverage when you get sick because of an administrative error
it will provide simple and clear information to consumers about their choices and their rights
and beyond making insurance more affordable and more secure, reform also will mean changes that make it easier for you   the backbone of the health care system   to do your jobs
already, over the past year, we've made one of the largest investments in the nursing and health workforce in recent history
we passed landmark reforms to make college more affordable, which can help more people gain a nursing degree   even as we provide grants and aid for more than 15,000 nurses seeking graduate degrees and other training
and we've begun the transition to private and secure computerized health records, because this will not only reduce errors and costs   i know you can't read those doctors' handwriting   it will mean you can spend more time with patients and less time with paperwork
and that's why you got into the profession
now, there is more work to do
and that's why today my administration is announcing a number of investments to expand the primary care workforce
this includes funding to allow students training part-time to become nurse practitioners to start training full-time
we want to speed up the process where folks go from the classroom into the exam room
and we're going to provide resources for clinics run by registered nurses and nurse practitioners
without these nurses, many people in cities and rural areas would have no access to care at all
now, all of these steps are part of a larger effort to make our system work better for nurses and for doctors, and to improve the quality of care for patients
and by focusing on primary medicine, we will finally recognize the role of all talented and skilled health care providers   including nurses
i don't have to tell you that nurses all too often have been given short shrift
even amidst a nursing shortage, when there are cutbacks, you feel the squeeze in salaries or the reduction in shifts   despite being overworked and underpaid
and, as you know, this disregard goes beyond numbers on a ledger
there have been a bunch of times, i'm sure, when the service you rendered is thought to be less consequential or valuable than that of other professions
that's what has to change
it's important that we not only ensure that you have the support to do your jobs   we're seeking to elevate and value the work that you do, because   throughout our history, nurses have done more than provide care and comfort to those in need
often with little power or sway on their own, nurses   mostly women, historically   have been a force of will and a sense of common decency, and paved the way towards better care and a more compassionate society   from clara barton's treatment of wounded soldiers at antietam, to the advocacy of dorothea dix on behalf of people with mental disabilities, to the countless nurses whose names we'll never know
one of america's greatest poets, walt whitman, also served as a nurse during the civil war
and the experience changed him forever
later, he would reflect on that time, on both the heartbreak and the fulfillment he found during those years
and he wrote
i thread my way through the hospitals,
the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand,
i sit by the restless all the dark night,
some are so young, some suffer so much,
i recall the experience sweet and sad
sweet and sad
your jobs are tough
your days can be stressful and exhausting and sometimes thankless
but through long shifts and late nights   in the hectic scrum of the emergency room, or in those quiet acts of humanity   you are saving lives, you are offering solace, you're helping to make us a better nation
and my task as president   our task as a people   is to ensure that our health care system is worthy of your efforts
our mission must be to live up to the values you uphold each and every day
so, thank you
god bless you
and god bless the united states of america
thank you, everybody
thank you
good evening
as we speak, our nation faces a multitude of challenges
at home, our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every american
abroad, our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al qaeda wherever it exists
and tonight, i've returned from a trip to the gulf coast to speak with you about the battle we're waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens
on april 20th, an explosion ripped through bp deepwater horizon drilling rig, about 40 miles off the coast of louisiana
eleven workers lost their lives
seventeen others were injured
and soon, nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean, oil began spewing into the water
because there has never been a leak this size at this depth, stopping it has tested the limits of human technology
that's why just after the rig sank, i assembled a team of our nation's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge   a team led by dr
steven chu, a nobel prize-winning physicist and our nation's secretary of energy
scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice
as a result of these efforts, we've directed bp to mobilize additional equipment and technology
and in the coming weeks and days, these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well
this is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that's expected to stop the leak completely
already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster america has ever faced
and unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it's not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days
the millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the gulf of mexico are more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years
but make no mistake
we will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long as it takes
we will make bp pay for the damage their company has caused
and we will do whatever's necessary to help the gulf coast and its people recover from this tragedy
tonight i'd like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward
what we're doing to clean up the oil, what we're doing to help our neighbors in the gulf, and what we're doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again
first, the cleanup
from the very beginning of this crisis, the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation's history   an effort led by admiral thad allen, who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters
we now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil
thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the gulf
and i've authorized the deployment of over 17,000 national guard members along the coast
these servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore, they're ready to help clean the beaches, train response workers, or even help with processing claims   and i urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible
because of our efforts, millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning, skimming and other collection methods
over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil
we've approved the construction of new barrier islands in louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore, and we're working with alabama, mississippi and florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines
as the cleanup continues, we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need
now, a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect, and new challenges will always arise
i saw and heard evidence of that during this trip
so if something isn't working, we want to hear about it
if there are problems in the operation, we will fix them
but we have to recognize that despite our best efforts, oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife
and sadly, no matter how effective our response is, there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done
that's why the second thing we're focused on is the recovery and restoration of the gulf coast
you know, for generations, men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water
that living is now in jeopardy
i've talked to shrimpers and fishermen who don't know how they're going to support their families this year
i've seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers   even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected
i've talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back
the sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money they've lost
it's about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost
i refuse to let that happen
tomorrow, i will meet with the chairman of bp and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company's recklessness
and this fund will not be controlled by bp
in order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent third party
beyond compensating the people of the gulf in the short term, it's also clear we need a long-term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region
the oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that's already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats
and the region still hasn't recovered from hurricanes katrina and rita
that's why we must make a commitment to the gulf coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment
i make that commitment tonight
earlier, i asked ray mabus, the secretary of the navy, who is also a former governor of mississippi and a son of the gulf coast, to develop a long-term gulf coast restoration plan as soon as possible
the plan will be designed by states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, businesses, conservationists and other gulf residents
and bp will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region
the third part of our response plan is the steps we're taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again
a few months ago, i approved a proposal to consider new, limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe   that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken
that obviously was not the case in the deepwater horizon rig, and i want to know why
the american people deserve to know why
the families i met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion   these families deserve to know why
and so i've established a national commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place
already, i've issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling
i know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue
and while i urge the commission to complete its work as quickly as possible, i expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially
one place we've already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the minerals management service
over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility   a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves
at this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight
oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations
when ken salazar became my secretary of the interior, one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency
but it's now clear that the problem there ran much deeper, and the pace of reform was just too slow
and so secretary salazar and i are bringing in new leadership at the agency   michael bromwich, who was a tough federal prosecutor and inspector general
and his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry's watchdog   not its partner
so one of the lessons we've learned from this spill is that we need better regulations, better safety standards, and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling
but a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry, drilling for oil these days entails greater risk
after all, oil is a finite resource
we consume more than 20 percent of the world's oil, but have less than 2 percent of the world's oil reserves
and that's part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean   because we're running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water
for decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered
for decades, we've talked and talked about the need to end america's century-long addiction to fossil fuels
and for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires
time and again, the path forward has been blocked   not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candor
the consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight
countries like china are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in america
each day, we send nearly $1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil
and today, as we look to the gulf, we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude
we cannot consign our children to this future
the tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now
now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash america's innovation and seize control of our own destiny
this is not some distant vision for america
the transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time, but over the last year and a half, we've already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry
as we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels
consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient
scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries
each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us
as we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs   but only if we accelerate that transition
only if we seize the moment
and only if we rally together and act as one nation   workers and entrepreneurs
scientists and citizens
the public and private sectors
when i was a candidate for this office, i laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence
last year, the house of representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill   a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for america's businesses
now, there are costs associated with this transition
and there are some who believe that we can't afford those costs right now
i say we can't afford not to change how we produce and use energy  because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater
so i'm happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party   as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels
some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks
some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power
others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development   and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development
all of these approaches have merit, and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead
but the one approach i will not accept is inaction
the one answer i will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet
you know, the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in world war ii
the same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon
and yet, time and again, we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom
instead, what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny   our determination to fight for the america we want for our children
even if we're unsure exactly what that looks like
even if we don't yet know precisely how we're going to get there
we know we'll get there
it's a faith in the future that sustains us as a people
it is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the gulf right now
each year, at the beginning of shrimping season, the region's fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to america long ago by fishing immigrants from europe
it's called the blessing of the fleet, and today it's a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea   some for weeks at a time
the ceremony goes on in good times and in bad
it took place after katrina, and it took place a few weeks ago   at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced
and still, they came and they prayed
for as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition, the blessing is not that god has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers
the blessing is that he is with us always, a blessing that's granted even in the midst of the storm
the oil spill is not the last crisis america will face
this nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again
what sees us through   what has always seen us through   is our strength, our resilience, and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it
tonight, we pray for that courage
we pray for the people of the gulf
and we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day
thank you, god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america
well, hello, pensacola
it is great to be here
i want everybody, first of all, to give a big round of applause to chief elison talabong for leading us in the pledge and singing our national anthem   to lieutenant commander randy ekstrom for the wonderful invocation
i want to thank your outstanding local leaders for welcoming me here today, including captains chris plummer, mike price and brad martin
give them a big round of applause
and your great senior enlisted leaders, including master chief mike dollen, give them a big round of applause
i want to thank all the spouses and families who are joining us here today
you hold our military families together, so we honor your service as well
it is great to be here in pensacola   america's oldest naval air station, the cradle of naval aviation
we've got navy   all the students of the naval air technical training center
(applause
)  we've got training wing six, maybe a few blue angels
we've got the united states marines in the house   maybe a few air force and army, too
now, i don't know how many could be here, because they're out there on the water right now, responding to the spill   but i want to thank all the folks at coast guard station pensacola for their outstanding work
and i know somebody who is especially proud of them, and that's the former commandant of the coast guard who postponed his retirement to answer his country's call once more and coordinate the federal response effort to the spill   and that's admiral thad allen
please give him a big round of applause
now, i was just down at the pensacola beach gulf pier, at the fish sandwich snack bar
now, i don't know if any of you ever checked it out
it's a nice spot
we were there with some of florida's state and local leaders to discuss the situation here
i want to acknowledge the hard work that's being done by the governor of florida, charlie crist
florida's chief financial officer, alex sink
senators bill nelson, george lemieux, representatives who are here today   we got jeff miller and corrine brown and ted deutch
please give them a big round of applause
we've got escambia county commissioner grover robinson and pensacola mayor mike wiggins
thank you very much for your outstanding efforts
i know all of you join me in thanking these leaders and their communities   because they're your neighbors   for the incredible support that they give all the men and women and your families here in pensacola
so we're grateful to you
but this is my fourth visit to the gulf coast since the start of this spill
yesterday, i was over in gulfport, mississippi
theodore, alabama
and now pensacola   assessing the situation, reviewing the response, seeing what needs to be done better and faster, and talking with folks   whether fishermen or small business people and their families   who are seeing their lives turned upside-down by this disaster
here in pensacola, the beautiful beaches are still open
the sand is white and the water is blue
so folks who are looking for a good vacation, they can still come down to pensacola
people need to know that pensacola is still open for business
but that doesn't mean that people aren't angry
that doesn't mean that people aren't scared
that doesn't mean that people have concerns about the future   we all have those concerns
and people have every right to be angry
those plumes of oil are off the coast
the fishing waters are closed
tar balls have been coming ashore
and everybody is bracing for more
so i'll say today what i've been saying up and down the coast over the last couple of days and over the last month
yes, this is an unprecedented environmental disaster   it's the worst in our nation's history
but we're going to continue to meet it with an unprecedented federal response and recovery effort   the largest in our nation's history
this is an assault on our shores, and we're going to fight back with everything we've got
and that includes mobilizing the resources of the greatest military in the world
here at naval air station pensacola, you've been one of the major staging areas
you've helped to support the response effort
and i thank you for that, and i know the people of pensacola thank you for that
and all along the gulf coast, our men and women in uniform   active, guard, and reserve   from across the country are stepping up and helping out
they're soldiers on the beaches putting out sandbags and building barriers and cleaning up the oil, and helping people process their claims for compensation from bp
they're sailors and marines offering their ships and their skimmers and their helicopters and miles of boom
they're airmen overhead, flying in equipment and spraying dispersant
and, of course, there are coast guardsmen and women on the cutters, in the air, working around the clock
and when i say this is the largest response of its kind in american history, i mean it
we've got more than 5,000 vessels on site   skimmers, tugs, barges, dozens of aircraft
more than 27,000 personnel are on the scene, fighting this every day, putting out millions of feet of boom and cleaning the shores
all told, we've authorized the deployment of 17,500 national guardsmen to respond to this crisis
so far, only about 1,600 have been activated
that leaves a lot of guardsmen ready to help
and if our governors call on them, i know they'll be ready, because they're always ready
so i want the people of this region to know that my administration is going to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to deal with this disaster
that includes the additional actions i announced yesterday to make sure that seafood from the gulf is safe to eat
it includes steps we've taken to protect the safety of workers involved in the cleanup
it includes the new command structure i announced this morning to make sure states and local communities like pensacola have the autonomy and the resources that they need to go forward
and that includes something else   making sure bp pays for the damages that it has caused   (applause)   because this isn't just an environmental disaster
for many families and communities, it's an economic disaster
here in pensacola and the panhandle, tourism is everything
and when the tourists stay home, it ripples out and hits folks across these communities   the charter boats, the hotels, the restaurants, the roadside stores, the shops, the suppliers, the dive shops
and if your inland waters are contaminated   if the bays and bayous are contaminated   it could be devastating, changing the way of life down here for years to come
i'm going to speak to the nation tonight about this
but let me say to the people of pensacola and the gulf coast
i am with you, my administration is with you for the long haul to make sure bp pays for the damage that it has done and to make sure that you are getting the help you need to protect this beautiful coast and to rehabilitate the damaged areas, to revitalize this region, and to make sure that nothing like this happens ever again
that is a commitment i am making to the people of florida and people all across this gulf
now, that spirit   that spirit of resolve and determination and resilience, that's the same spirit we see in all of you, the men and women in uniform, the spirit we'll need to meet other challenges of our time
obviously the news has been dominated lately by the oil spill, but our nation is at war and all of you have stepped forward
you volunteered
you took an oath
you stood tall and you said, i will serve
and here at pensacola, you're carrying on the proud tradition of naval aviation that spans a century
here at the barrancas national cemetery, our heroes from yesterday's wars are still inspiring us
and like generations before you, you're no strangers to sacrifice
our prayers are with the families and friends of the crews that you lost in that training exercise two months ago
today, we send out our thoughts and prayers to all the folks from pensacola on the frontlines at this very moment, including iraq and afghanistan
they are making us incredibly proud
and so are you
as naval aviators and naval flight officers, you'll soon earn your wings of gold
many of you will prove yourselves as indispensable air crews   the mechanics, the engineers, the electricians, the maintenance crews   people's lives depending on what you do each and every day
i know you're looking ahead to your first operational tours   to join the fleet and your squadrons
and within weeks, some of you may find yourselves serving on a carrier deck in the arabian sea or working a busy flight line in afghanistan
and as you begin your careers, as you look ahead to a life of service, i want you to know   on behalf of the american people   that your nation thanks you, your nation appreciates you, your nation will stand with you every step of the way
and as your commander-in-chief, i want you to know something
i will not hesitate to use force to protect the american people or our vital interests
but i will also never risk your lives unless it's absolutely necessary
and if it is necessary, we are going to back you up to the hilt with the strategy and the clear mission and the equipment and the support that you need to get the job done right
that's my promise to every one of you, every man and woman who wears america's uniform
that includes the right strategy in iraq, where we're partnering with the iraqi people for their long-term security and prosperity
and thanks to the honor and the heroism of our troops, we are poised to end our combat mission in iraq this summer   on schedule
as we end the war in iraq, we're pressing forward in afghanistan
we're working to break the momentum of the taliban insurgency and train afghan security forces, strengthen the capacity of the afghan government and protect the afghan people
we will disrupt and dismantle and ultimately defeat al qaeda and its terrorist affiliates
(applause
)  and we will support the aspirations of people around the world as they seek progress and opportunity and prosperity, because that's what we do   as americans
as you meet the missions we ask of you, we're going to make sure you're trained and equipped to succeed
that's why we halted reductions in the navy
that's why we increased the size of the marine corps
that's why we're investing in the capabilities and technologies of tomorrow
and as we come up on the 100th anniversary of naval aviation next year, we're committed to the next generation of aircraft
we're going to keep you the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped military that the world has ever known
some of that is about technology
but the most important thing in our military is our people   it's all of you
and as you advance through the ranks and start families of your own, we want to be there for your loved ones, too
this is one of the defining missions of the first lady, michelle obama
on sunday, she visited the navy-marine corps team and their families at camp pendleton
and they had a tough week, because five outstanding marines from pendleton gave their lives last week in afghanistan
during her visit, michelle had a message for their families and for all military families
america is going to keep faith with you, too
when a loved one goes to war, that family goes to war
that's why we're working to improve family readiness and increase pay and benefits, working to give you more time between deployments, increasing support to help spouses and families deal with the stresses and the separation of war
but this can't be the work of government alone
as michelle has been saying, 1 percent of americans may be fighting our wars, but 100 percent of americans need to be supporting our men and women and their families in uniform
you guys shouldn't be carrying the entire burden
that's why michelle is challenging every sector of american society to support our military families   not just now, with our nation at war, but at every stage of your lives
so we're improving care for our wounded warriors, especially those with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury
we're funding the post-9/11 gi bill   to give you and your families the chance to pursue your dreams
we've made a historic commitment to our veterans with one of the largest percentage increases to the va budget in the past 30 years
those are concrete actions we've taken to meet the commitment i have to you and that the american people have to you
because you've always taken care of america, america needs to take care of you
and that's my main message here today
we're all in this together
in our country, there isn't a military world and a civilian world
we're all americans
there's not democrats and republicans, when you take the long view   we're all americans
we all rise and fall together
and we all need to do our part to get through the challenges we face as a people
so, yes, we're emerging from the worst economic crisis since the great depression
too many folks are still out of work here in florida and around the country
yes, we're a nation at war with adversaries who will stop at nothing to strike our homeland and would kill innocent people, women and children, with no compunction
yes, we're now battling the worst economic   environmental disaster in american history
any one of these challenges alone would test our country
confronting them all at once might overwhelm a lesser nation
but look around you
look at the person standing next to you
you look around and you see the strength and resilience that will carry us through
you look at this installation and the forts that have stood watch over this bay and its people for centuries   through the rise and fall of empires, through a terrible civil war   and as a nation healed itself, we became a beacon to the world
we've endured
all of these men and women in uniform, all of you represent the same spirit of service and sacrifice as those who've gone before   who defeated fascism, defeated tyranny, prevailed in a long cold war over communism
and now, in our time, you've toppled regimes based on terror and dictatorship, and you've given new hope to millions of people
you've earned your place among the greatest of generations
and look at the people of this city and this region   fishermen who've made their lives on the water, families who've lived here for generations, hardworking folks who've had to endure more than their share   tough economic times and hurricanes and storms that forced so many families and communities to start over from scratch
but they never gave up
they started over, and they rebuilt stronger than before
as americans, we don't quit
we keep coming
none of these challenges we're facing are going to be easy
none of them are going to be quick, but make no mistake, the united states of america has gone through tough times before and we always come out stronger
and we will do so again
and this city and this region will recover
it will thrive again
and america's military will prevail in the mission to keep our country safe
and our nation will endure from these trials stronger than before
that is the history of the united states of america
that is the legacy of our armed forces
and i promise you that we will not falter
past generations have passed on this precious gift to us, and future generations are depending on us
and as i look out on each and every one of your faces, i'm absolutely confident that you will meet that challenge
god bless you and god bless the united states of america
alright
good afternoon, everybody
today, the united nations security council voted overwhelmingly to sanction iran for its continued failure to live up to its obligations
this resolution will put in place the toughest sanctions ever faced by the iranian government, and it sends an unmistakable message about the international community's commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons
for years, the iranian government has failed to live up to its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
it has violated its commitments to the international atomic energy agency
it has ignored u
security council resolutions
and while iran's leaders hide behind outlandish rhetoric, their actions have been deeply troubling
indeed, when i took office just over 16 months ago, iranian intransigence was well-established
iran had gone from zero centrifuges spinning to several thousand, and the international community was divided about how to move forward
yet this day was not inevitable
we made clear from the beginning of my administration that the united states was prepared to pursue diplomatic solutions to address the concerns over iranian nuclear programs
i extended the offer of engagement on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect
and together with the united kingdom, with russia, china, and germany, we sat down with our iranian counterparts
we offered the opportunity of a better relationship between iran and the international community   one that reduced iran's political isolation, and increased its economic integration with the rest of the world
in short, we offered the iranian government the prospect of a better future for its people, if   and only if   it lives up to its international obligations
so there is no double standard at play here
we've made it clear, time and again, that we respect iran's right, like all countries, to access peaceful nuclear energy
that is a right embedded in the npt   a treaty that has to serve as the safeguard against a world in which more nations acquire the world's most deadly weapons, and international law is treated as an empty promise
that npt treaty was signed by all the parties involved, and it is a treaty that the united states has sought to strengthen from the day i took office, including through our own commitments to reduce america's nuclear arsenal
so let me repeat
we recognize iran's rights
but with those rights come responsibilities
and time and again, the iranian government has failed to meet those responsibilities
iran concealed a nuclear enrichment facility in qom that raised serious questions about the nature of its program
iran further violated its own obligations under u
security council resolutions to suspend uranium enrichment
instead, they're enriching up to 20 percent
it has failed to comply fully with iaea's requirements
indeed, iran is the only npt signatory in the world   the only one   that cannot convince the iaea that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes
that's why the international community was compelled to impose these serious consequences
these are the most comprehensive sanctions that the iranian government has faced
they will impose restrictions on iran's nuclear activities, its ballistic missile program, and, for the first time, its conventional military
they will put a new framework in place to stop iranian smuggling, and crack down on iranian banks and financial transactions
they target individuals, entities, and institutions   including those associated with the revolutionary guard   that have supported iran's nuclear program and prospered from illicit activities at the expense of the iranian people
and we will ensure that these sanctions are vigorously enforced, just as we continue to refine and enforce our own sanctions on iran alongside our friends and our allies
the strong resolution that was passed today benefited from strong international support
in voting for it, we were joined by nations from asia, africa, europe, and latin america   including russia and china
and these sanctions show the united view of the international community that a nuclear arms race in the middle east is in nobody's interest, and that nations must be held accountable for challenging the global non-proliferation regime
the iranian government must understand that true security will not come through the pursuit of nuclear weapons
true security will come through adherence to international law and the demonstration of its peaceful intent
we know that the iranian government will not change its behavior overnight, but today's vote demonstrates the growing costs that will come with iranian intransigence
and i want to be clear
these sanctions do not close the door on diplomacy
iran continues to have the opportunity to take a different and better path
i would like nothing more than to reach the day when the iranian government fulfills its international obligations   a day when these sanctions are lifted, previous sanctions are lifted, and the iranian people can finally fulfill the greatness of the iranian nation
indeed, these sanctions are not directed at the iranian people
as i said in cairo, for decades the iranian government has defined itself in opposition to my country
but faced with the opportunity to find a new way forward   one that would benefit its own people   the iranian government has chosen instead to remain a prisoner of the past
saturday will mark one year from the day that an election captivated the attention of the world   an event that should have been remembered for how the iranian people participated with remarkable enthusiasm, but will instead be remembered for how the iranian government brutally suppressed dissent and murdered the innocent, including a young woman left to die in the street
actions do have consequences, and today the iranian government will face some of those consequences
because whether it is threatening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, or the human rights of its own citizens, or the stability of its own neighbors by supporting terrorism, the iranian government continues to demonstrate that its own unjust actions are a threat to justice everywhere
i want and hope for the people of iran that the government of iran will make a different choice
it can make a different choice and pursue a course that will reaffirm the npt as the basis of global non-proliferation and disarmament   a course that will advance iran's own security and prosperity, and the peace of the wider world
today's sanctions are yet another signal that if the iranian government continues to undermine the npt and the peace that it protects, then iran will find itself more isolated, less prosperous and less secure
thank you
thank you
thank you, everybody
please be seated
hello, giants
it is good   it is good to be here, and congratulations class of 2010
i am honored to be part of this special occasion
we love you
and i love you back
let me acknowledge your extraordinary governor, jennifer granholm
superintendent rice, thank you for your inspiring words
your mayor, bobby hopewell, who i understand is a proud kalamazoo graduate himself
thanks to principal washington for   not just for the warm introduction, but for his enthusiasm and his energy and his leadership and his nice singing voice
thank you
to all the trustees, to the alumni, to the parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins   everybody who's been a part of this extraordinary place
and i want to recognize our student speakers
cindy, who embodies the best of our traditions in this country   arrived three or four years ago and graduates as the valedictorian   this is what is continually replenishing the energy and the dynamism and the innovation of this country, and we could not be prouder of you
thank you
and to simon, i'm glad that, according to the constitution, you can't run till you're 35
so i'll be long gone by then
but it gives me great confidence to know that we've got such incredible young leaders who are going to be remaking the world in so many different ways
now, recently, an article from your local paper, the kalamazoo gazette   was brought to my attention
and it ran just after this school had been chosen as one of the six finalists in our race to the top commencement challenge
and for those who aren't aware of it, this is a contest to highlight schools that promote academic excellence, personal responsibility and that best prepare students for college and careers
and this article in the gazette quoted a young lady named kelsey wilson
where is   is kelsey here
she right over there
anyway
she's here
she's over there
hey, kelsey
how are you
so kelsey was quoted as saying, we're the kind of school that never gets credit for what we do
and our school is amazing
this is what kelsey said, our school is amazing
well, kelsey, class of 2010, members of the kalamazoo community, i'm here tonight because after three rounds of competition, with more than a thousand schools, and more than 170,000 votes cast, i know   and america knows   what you've done at kalamazoo central
you are amazing
we know
we know
our amazing secretary of education arne duncan knows
folks in washington know, folks across the country know, and hopefully after tonight, everybody knows
now, together as a community, you've embraced the motto of this school district
every child, every opportunity, every time
every time
every child, every opportunity, every time, because you believe, like i do, that every young person, every child   regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how much money their parents have   every child who walks through your schoolhouse doors deserves a quality education
no exceptions
and i'm here tonight because i think that america has a lot to learn from kalamazoo central about what makes for a successful school in this new century
you've got educators raising standards and then inspiring their students to meet them
you've got community members who are stepping up as tutors and mentors and coaches
you got parents who are taking an active interest in their child's education   attending those teacher conferences, yes, turning off the tv once in a while, making sure homework gets done
arne duncan is here tonight because these are the values, these are the changes that he's encouraging in every school in this nation
it's the key to our future
but the most important ingredient is you
students who raised your sights, who aimed high, who invested yourselves in your own success
it's no accident that so many of you have received college admissions letters, class of 2010
that didn't happen by accident
it happened because you worked for it
as the superintendent said, you earned it
so, kelsey, i agree with you
what you've done here at kalamazoo central is amazing
i am proud of you
your parents are proud of you
your teachers, your principal   we're all incredibly proud
now, graduates, all these folks around you, i have to say, though, with the cameras and the beaming smiles   they've worked hard to give you everything you need to pursue your dreams and fulfill your god-given talent
unfortunately, you can't take them with you when you leave here
no one is going to go follow you around making sure that you're getting to class on time, making sure you're doing your work
nobody is going to be doing that for you
going forward, that's all on you   responsibility for your success is squarely on your shoulders
and the question i have for you today is this
what is each   what are each of you going to do to meet that responsibility
now, right now you're getting plenty of advice from everybody
some of it's helpful
and so i hate to pile on with advice
but while i'm here   what the heck
i figure i should offer a few thoughts based on my own experiences, but also based on my hopes for all of you, and for our country, in the years ahead
first, understand that your success in life won't be determined just by what's given to you, or what happens to you, but by what you do with all that's given to you
what you do with all that happens to you
how hard you try
how far you push yourself
how high you're willing to reach
true excellence only comes with perseverance
this wasn't something i really understood when i was back your age
my father, some of you know, left my family when i was two years old
i was raised by a single mom and my grandparents
and sometimes i had a tendency to goof off
as my mother put it, i had a tendency sometimes to act a bit casual about my future
sometimes i was rebellious
sometimes i partied a little too much
oh, yes, yes, this is a cautionary tale
don't be cheering when i say that
studied just enough to get by
i thought hard work, responsibility, that's old-fashioned
that's just people want to tell me what to do
but after a few years, after i was living solely on my own and i realized that living solely for my own entertainment wasn't so entertaining anymore, that it wasn't particularly satisfying anymore, that i didn't seem to be making much of a ripple in the world, i started to change my tune
i realized that by refusing to apply myself, there was nothing i could point to that i was proud of that would last
now, you come of an age in a popular culture that actually reinforces this approach to life
you watch tv, and basically what it says is you can be rich and successful without much effort
you just have to become a celebrity
if you can achieve some reality tv notoriety, that's better than lasting achievement
we live in a culture that tells you there's a quick fix for every problem and a justification for every selfish desire
and all of you were raised with cell phones and ipods, and texting and emails, and you're able to call up a fact, or a song, or a friend with the click of a button
so you're used to instant gratification
but meaningful achievement, lasting success   it doesn't happen in an instant
it's not about luck, it's not about a sudden stroke of genius
it's not usually about talent
it's usually about daily effort, the large choices and the small choices that you make that add up over time
it's about the skills you build, and the knowledge you accumulate, and the energy you invest in every task, no matter how trivial or menial it may seem at the time
you've got an alum who plays for the yankees, i hear
he's supposed to be pretty good
now, derek jeter wasn't born playing shortstop for the yankees
he got there through years of effort
and his high school baseball coach once remarked, i'm surprised he still doesn't have blisters and that i don't have the blisters on my hands from hitting ground balls just for derek
he always wanted more
‘how about one more turn in the batting cage
or 25 more ground balls
thomas edison tested more than 6,000 different materials for just one tiny part of the light bulb that he invented
think about that   6,000 tests
rowling's first harry potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally published
mozart was a musical prodigy, but he practiced for hours each day   accumulating thousands of hours at the piano by the time he was just six years old
i understand that your boys' basketball team did pretty good
first state champions for the first time in 59 years
that didn't happen by accident
they put in work
they put in effort
so, today, you all have a rare and valuable chance to pursue your own passions, chase your own dreams without incurring a mountain of debt
what an incredible gift
so you've got no excuse for giving anything less than your best effort
no excuses
that's my second piece of advice, very simple
don't make excuses
take responsibility not just for your successes
take responsibility where you fall short as well
now, the truth is, no matter how hard you work, you're not going to ace every class   well, maybe cindy will, but   but you're not going to ace every class
you're not going to succeed the first time you try something
there are going to be times when you screw up
there will be times where you hurt people you love
there will be times where you make a mistake and you stray from the values that you hold most deeply
and when that happens, it's the easiest thing in the world to start looking around for somebody else to blame
your professor was too hard
your boss was a jerk
the coaches   was playing favorites
your friend just didn't understand
your wife   oh, no
i'm just messing with michelle right there
that was all in fun
no, but this is an easy habit to get into
you see it every day in washington   every day   folks calling each other names, making all sorts of accusations on television
everybody is always pointing a finger at somebody else
you notice that
now, this community could have easily gone down that road
this community could have made excuses   well, our kids have fewer advantages, our schools have fewer resources   how can we compete
you could have spent years pointing fingers   blaming parents, blaming teachers, blaming the principal, blaming the superintendent, blaming the president
but that's   class of 2010, i want you to pay attention on this because that's not what happened
instead, this community was honest with itself about where you were falling short
you resolved to do better, push your kids harder, open their minds wider, expose them to all kinds of ideas and people and experiences
so, graduates, i hope you'll continue those efforts
don't make excuses
and i hope that wherever you go, you won't narrow the broad intellectual and social exposure you've had here at kalamazoo central   instead, seek to expand it
don't just hang out with people who look like you, or go to the same church you do, or share your political views
broaden your circle to include people with different backgrounds and life experiences
because that's how you'll end up learning what it's like to walk in somebody else's shoes
that's how you'll come to understand the challenges other people face
and this is not just an academic exercise
it's a way to broaden your ambit of concern and learn to see yourselves in each other
which brings me to my final piece of advice for today, and that's to give back, to be part of something bigger than yourselves
hitch your wagon to something that is bigger than yourselves
i know that so many of you have already served your community through efforts like your stuff the bus food drives and groups like activists for action
and i commend you for that
but i also know that many of you are the first in your family to go to college
and right about now, you may be feeling all the weight of their hopes and expectations coming down on your shoulders
and once you start juggling those classes and activities and that campus job, and you get caught up in your own dreams and your own anxieties and dating   you may feel like you've got enough on your plate just dealing with your own life
it might be easier to turn the channel when the news disturbs you, to avert your eyes when you pass that homeless man on the street, to tell yourself that other people's problems really aren't your responsibility
but just think about what the consequence of that approach to life would have been if that's how folks had acted here in this community
what if those kalamazoo promise donors had said to themselves, well, you know what, i can pay for my own kid's education
why should i have to pay for somebody else's
think about the consequences for our country
what if our founding fathers had said, you know, colonialism is kind of oppressive, but i'm doing okay, my family's doing all right, why should i spend my summer in philadelphia arguing about a constitution
what if those abolitionists, those civil right workers had said, you know, slavery is wrong, segregation is wrong, but it's kind of dangerous to get mixed up in that stuff
i don't have time for all those meetings and marches
i think i'm going to take a pass
i hope it works out, but that's not something i want to do
i want you to think for a minute about the extraordinary men and women who've worn our country's uniform and have given their last full measure of devotion to keep us safe and free
what if they said   what if they said, i really do love this country, but why should i sacrifice so much for people i've never even met
young men and women in uniform right now making those sacrifices
so you and i are here today because those people made a different choice
they chose to step up
they chose to serve
and i hope you will follow their example, because there is work to be done, and your country needs you
we've got an economy to rebuild
we've got children to educate
we've got diseases to cure
we've got threats to face
we've got an oil spill to clean up
we've got clean energy to discover
and it is going to be up to you to meet all of those challenges   to build industries and make discoveries and inspire the next generation
it's going to be up to you to heal the divide that continues to afflict our world
now, i'm not saying you got to do it here all at once
but as theodore roosevelt once put it, i'm asking you to do what you can, with what you've got, where you are
and i can guarantee that wherever your journey takes you, there are going to be children who need mentors and senior citizens who need assistance, folks down on their luck who could use a helping hand
and once you've reached out and formed those connections, you'll find it's a little harder to numb yourself to other people's suffering
it's a little harder to ignore the national debates about the issues that affect their lives and yours
in the end, service binds us to each other   and to our communities and our country   in a way that nothing else can
it's how we become more fully american
that's the reason those donors created the kalamazoo promise in the first place   not for recognition or reward, but because of their connection to this community
because their belief in your potential
because their faith that you would use this gift not just to enrich your own lives, but the lives of others and the life of the nation
and i'm told that soon after the promise was established, a first grader approached the superintendent at the time and declared to her
i'm going to college
first grader
i'm going to college
i don't know what it is, but i'm going
we may never know those donors' names, but we know how they helped bring this community together and how you've embraced their promise not just as a gift to be appreciated, but a responsibility to be fulfilled
we know how they have helped inspire an entire generation of young people here in kalamazoo to imagine a different future for themselves
and graduates, today, i'm asking you to pay them back by seeking to have the same kind of impact with your own lives
by pursuing excellence in everything you do
by serving this country that you love
i know that you can do it
after all, you are the giants   and with the education you've gotten here, there's nothing you can't do
thank you very much, everybody
god bless you
and god bless the united states of america
and god bless the class of 2010
thank you very much
let me begin by thanking dr
jared cohon, and the entire carnegie mellon community, for welcoming me once again, and for the terrific work that he and the administration, faculty and staff do here each and every day
i also want to acknowledge your outstanding mayor   who doesn't look any older than the last time i saw him   mayor luke ravenstahl
there he is, right there
it is great to be back at carnegie mellon, and in the beautiful city of pittsburgh
i love visiting a good sports town
last year, i stole dan rooney to serve as my ambassador to ireland
to make it up, i invited both the steelers and the penguins to the white house to celebrate their championships
seeing how the blackhawks are headed to philly tonight with a 2-0 lead in the stanley cup finals, i'm just glad that we're on this side of the state
i noticed a couple of people said they were rooting for the blackhawks, which tells me something about the rivalry between pittsburgh and philly
of course, we meet here at an incredibly difficult time for america
among other things, it's a time when the worst environmental disaster of its kind in our nation's history is threatening the gulf coast and the people who live there
right now, stopping this oil spill and containing its damage is necessarily the top priority not just of my administration but i think of the entire country
and we're waging this battle every minute of every day
but at the same time, we're continuing our efforts to recover and rebuild from an economic disaster that has touched the lives of nearly every american
that's what i want to talk about today   the state of our economy, the future we must seize, and the path we chose to get there
it has now been a little over 16 months since i took office amid one of the worst economic storms in our history
and to navigate that storm, my administration was forced to take some dramatic and unpopular steps
these steps have succeeded in breaking the freefall
we're again moving in the right direction
an economy that was shrinking at an alarming rate when i became president has now been growing for three consecutive quarters
after losing an average of 750,000 jobs a month during the winter of last year, we've now added jobs for five of the last six months, and we expect to see strong job growth in friday's report
the taxpayer money it cost to shore up the financial sector and the auto industry, that's being repaid
and both gm and chrysler are adding shifts and operating at a profit
so, despite temporary setbacks, uncertain world events, and the resulting ups and downs of the market, this economy is getting stronger by the day
now, that doesn't mean this recession is by any means over for the millions of americans who are still looking for a job or a way to pay the bills
not by a long shot
the devastation created by the deepest downturn since the great depression has hit people and communities across our country very hard
and it's not going to be a real recovery until people can feel it in their own lives
in the immediate future, this means doing whatever is necessary to keep the recovery going and to spur job growth
but in the long term, it means recognizing that for a lot of middle-class families   for entire communities, in some case   a sense of economic security has been missing since long before the recession began
over the last decade, these families saw their income decline
they saw the cost of things like health care and college tuition reach record highs
they lived through a so-called economic expansion that generated slower job growth than at any prior expansion since world war ii
some people have called the last 10 years the lost decade
so the anxiety that's out there today isn't new
the recession has certainly made it worse, but that feeling of not being in control of your own economic future   that sense that the american dream might slowly be slipping away   that's been around for some time now
and for better or for worse, our generation of americans has been buffeted by tremendous forces of economic change
long gone are the days when a high school diploma could guarantee a job at a local factory   not when so many of those factories had moved overseas
pittsburgh, a city that once was defined by the steel industry, knows this better than just about anybody
and today, the ability of jobs and entire industries to relocate where there's skilled workers and an internet connection has forced america to compete like never before
from china to india to europe, other nations have already realized this
they're putting a greater emphasis on math and science, and demanding more from their students
some countries are building high-speed railroads and expanding broadband access
they're making serious investments in technology and clean energy because they want to win the competition for those jobs
so we can't afford to stand pat while the world races by
the united states of america did not become the most prosperous nation on earth by sheer luck or happenstance
we got here because each time a generation of americans has faced a changing world, we have changed with it
we have not feared our future
we have shaped it
america does not stand still
we move forward
and that's why i've said that as we emerge from this recession, we can't afford to return to the pre-crisis status quo
we can't go back to an economy that was too dependent on bubbles and debt and financial speculation
we can't accept economic growth that leaves the middle class owing more and making less
we have to build a new and stronger foundation for growth and prosperity   and that's exactly what we've been doing for the last 16 months
it's a foundation based on investments in our people and their future
investments in the skills and education we need to compete
investments in a 21st century infrastructure for america, from high-speed railroads to high-speed internet
investments in research and technology, like clean energy, that can lead to new jobs and new exports and new industries
this new foundation is also based on reforms that will make our economy stronger and our businesses more competitive   reforms that will make health care cheaper, our financial system more secure, and our government less burdened with debt
in a global economy, we can't pursue this agenda in a vacuum
at the height of the financial crisis, the coordinated action we took with the nations of the g20 prevented a global depression and helped restore worldwide growth
and as we've recently witnessed in europe, economic difficulties in one part of the world can affect everybody else
and that's why we have to keep on working with the nations of the g20 to pursue more balanced growth
that's why we need to coordinate financial reform with other nations so that we avoid a global race to the bottom
it's why we need to open new markets and meet the goal of my national export initiative
to double our exports over the next five years
and it's why we need to ensure that our competitors play fair and our agreements are enforced
this, too, is part of building a new foundation
now, some of you may have noticed that we have been building this foundation without much help from our friends in the other party
from our efforts to rescue the economy, to health insurance reform, to financial reform, most have sat on the sidelines and shouted from the bleachers
they said no to tax cuts for small businesses
no to tax credits for college tuition
no to investments in clean energy
they said no to protecting patients from insurance companies and consumers from big banks
and some of this, of course, is just politics
before i was even inaugurated, the congressional leaders of the other party got together and made a calculation that if i failed, they'd win
so when i went to meet with them about the need for a recovery act, in the midst of crisis, they announced they were against it before i even arrived at the meeting
before we even had a health care bill, a republican senator actually said, if we're able to stop obama on this, it will be his waterloo
it will break him
so those weren't very hopeful signs
but to be fair, a good deal of the other party's opposition to our agenda has also been rooted in their sincere and fundamental belief about the role of government
it's a belief that government has little or no role to play in helping this nation meet our collective challenges
it's an agenda that basically offers two answers to every problem we face
more tax breaks for the wealthy and fewer rules for corporations
the last administration called this recycled idea the ownership society
but what it essentially means is that everyone is on their own
no matter how hard you work, if your paycheck isn't enough to pay for college or health care or childcare, well, you're on your own
if misfortune causes you to lose your job or your home, you're on your own
and if you're a wall street bank or an insurance company or an oil company, you pretty much get to play by your own rules, regardless of the consequences for everybody else
now, i've never believed that government has all the answers
government cannot and should not replace businesses as the true engine of growth and job creation
government can't instill good values and a sens
good afternoon
this is the most wonderful press conference of the year
i've got a list of who's been naughty and nice to call on
but first let me make a couple of quick points then i will take your questions
typically i use this year-end press conference to review how far we've come over the course of the year
today, understandably, i am going to talk a little bitabout how far we've come over the past eight years
as i was preparing to take office, the unemployment rate was on its way to 10%, today it's at 4
the lowest in nearly a decade
we have seen the longest streak of job growth on record and wages have grown faster the past few years any time in the past 40
when i came into office 44 million people were uninsured, today we've covered more than 20 million of them
for the first time in our history, more than 90% of americans are insured
in fact, yesterday was the biggest day ever for healthcare
gov
more than 670,000 americans signed up to get covered and more are signing up by the day
we've cut our dependence on foreign oil by more than half, doubled production of renewable energy and enacted the most sweeping reforms since fdr to protect consumers and prevent a crisis on wall street from punishing main street ever again
none of these actions stifled growth as critics predicted
instead, the stock market has nearly tripled
since i signed obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs and the economy is undoubtedly more durable than it was in the days when we relied on oil from unstable nations and banks took whiskey bets with your money
add it all up and last year, the poverty rate fell at the fastest rate in almost 50 years while the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record
in fact, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top
and we've done all this while cutting or deficits by nearly two thirds and protecting vital investments that grow the middle class
bin laden, rather than being at large, has been taken off the battlefield along with thousands of other terrorists
over the past eight years, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully executed an attack on our homeland that was directed from overseas
through diplomacy, we've ensured that iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon, without going to war with iran
we've opened up a new chapter with the people of cuba and we brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could very well save this planet for our kids
and, almost every country on earth sees america as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago
well, good afternoon
and, sabah, thank you for the wonderful introduction and for your example   your devotion to your faith and your education, and your service to others
you're an inspiration
you're going to be a fantastic doctor
and i suspect, sabah, your parents are here because they wanted to see you so where are sabah's parents
there you go
good job, mom
she did great, didn't she
she was terrific
to everyone here at the islamic society of baltimore, thank you for welcoming me here today
i want to thank muslim americans leaders from across this city and this state, and some who traveled even from out of state to be here
i want to recognize congressman johnsarbanes, who is here
as well as two other great leaders in congress   and proud muslim
americans congressman keith ellison from the great state of minnesota andcongressman andre carson from the great state of indiana
this mosque, like so many in our country, is an all-american story
you've been part of this city for nearly half a century
you serve thousands of families some who've lived here for decades as well as immigrants from many countries who've worked to become proud american citizens
all right
good afternoon, everybody
i know you are all eager to skip town and spend some time with your families
not surprisingly, i am, too
but you know what they say
it's the most wonderful press conference of the year right now
(laughter) i am eager to take your questions, but, first, i just want to say a few words about our economy
in 2013, our businesses created another 2 million jobs, adding up to more than 8 million in just over the past 45 months
this morning, we learned that over the summer our economy grew at its strongest pace in nearly two years
the unemployment rate has steadily fallen to its lowest point in five years
our tax code is fairer, and our fiscal situation is firmer, with deficits that are now less than half of what they were when i took office
for the first time in nearly two decades, we now produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world
and our all-of-the-above strategy for new american energy means lower energy costs
the affordable care act has helped keep health care costs growing at their slowest rate in 50 years
combined that means bigger paychecks for middle-class families and bigger savings for businesses looking to invest and hire here in america
and for all the challenges we've had and all the challenges that we've been working on diligently in dealing with both the aca and the website these past couple months, more than 500,000 americans have enrolled through healthcare
gov in the first three weeks of december alone
in california, for example, a state operating its own marketplace, more than 15,000 americans are enrolling every single day
and in the federal website, tens of thousands are enrolling every single day
since october 1st, more than 1 million americans have selected new health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces
now, this holiday season, there are mothers and fathers and entrepreneurs and workers who have something new to celebrate, the security of knowing that when the unexpected or misfortune strikes, hardship no longer has to
and you add that all up, and what it means is we head into next year with an economy that's stronger than it was when we started the year, more americans are finding work and experiencing the pride of a paycheck, our businesses are positioned for new growth and new jobs
it's a good start that earlier this week, for the first time in years, both parties in both houses of congress came together to pass a budget that unwinds some of the damaging sequester cuts that created headwinds for our economy
it clears the path for businesses and for investments that we need to strengthen our middle class, like education and scientific research
and it means that the american people won't be exposed to the threat of another reckless shutdown ever few months
so that's a good thing
it's probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it's also fair to say that we're not condemned to endless gridlock
there are areas where we can work together
i believe that work should begin with something that republicans in congress should have done before leaving town this week, and that's restoring the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet when they are looking for a job
because congress didn't act, more than 1 million of their constituents will lose a vital economic lifeline at christmastime, leaving a lot of job seekers without any source of income at all
i think we're a better country than that
we don't abandon each other when times are tough
keep in mind, unemployment insurance only goes to folks who are actively looking for work   the mom who needs help feeding her kids when she sends out her resumes, or a dad who needs help paying the rent while working part-time and still earning the skills he needs for that new job
let me repeat
i think 2014 needs to be a year of action
we've got work to do to create more good jobs, to help more americans earn the skills and education they need to do those jobs, and to make sure that those jobs offer the wages and benefits that let families build a little bit of financial security
we still have the task of finishing the fix on our broken immigration system
we've got to build on the progress we've painstakingly made over these last five years with respect to our economy and offer the middle class and all those who are looking to join the middle class a better opportunity
and that's going to be where i focus all of my efforts in the year ahead
and let me conclude by saying just as we're strengthening our position here at home, we're also standing up for our interests around the world
this year, we've demonstrated that with clear-eyed principled diplomacy, we can pursue new paths to a world that's more secure, a future where iran does not build a nuclear weapon, a future where syria's chemical weapons stockpiles are destroyed
by the end of next year, the war in afghanistan will be over, just as we've ended our war in iraq
and we'll continue to bring our troops home
and as always, we will remain vigilant to protect our homeland and our personnel overseas from terrorist attacks
of course, a lot of our men and women in uniform are still overseas and a lot of them are still spending their christmas far away from their family and their friends, and in some cases still in harm's way
so i want to close by saying to them and their families back home, we want to thank you
your country stands united in supporting you and being grateful for your service and your sacrifice
we will keep you in our thoughts and in our prayers during this season of hope
i gotta tell you
that's not how i think about it
i have now been in office five years, close to five years
was running for president for two years before that and, for those of you who cover me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs
you know, not passing background checks in the wake of newtown is something that i continue to believe was a mistake
but then i also look at, because of the debate that occurred, all the work that's been done at state levels to increase gun safety, and   and to make sure we do not see tragedies like that happen again
so we do not always get attention for it, but the connect ed program that we announced, where we're gonna be initiating wireless capacity in every classroom in america will make a huge difference for kids all across the country, and for teachers
the manufacturing hub that we set up in youngstown is something i talked about during the state of the union is gonna create innovation and connect universities, manufacturers, job training to help create a renaissance   build on a renaissance we're seeing in manufacturing
and if you look at, for example, immigration reform, probably the biggest thing that i wanted to get done this year, we saw progress
it passed the senate with a strong bipartisan vote
there are indications in the house that, even though it did not get completed this year, that there is a commitment on the part of the speaker to try to move forward legislation early next year
and the fact that it didn't hit the timeline that i prefer is obviously frustrating, but it's not something i end up brooding a lot about
i guess what i'm saying is if you're measuring this by polls, my polls have gone up and down a lot through the course of my career
i mean, if i was interested in polling, i won't have run for president
i was polling at 70% when i was in the u
senate
i took this job to deliver for the american people, and i knew and will continue to know that there are going to be ups and downs on it
you're right, the health care website problems were a source of great frustration
i think, in the last press conference that i adequately discussed my frustrations on those
on the other hand, since that time i now have a couple million people, maybe more, who are going to have health care on january 1st
and that is a big deal
that's why i ran for this office
and as long as i've got an opportunity every single day to make sure that in ways large and small i'm creating greater opportunity for people, more kids are able to go to school, get the education they need, more families are able to stabilize their finances, you now, the housing market is continuing to improve, people feel like their wages   maybe   are inching up a little bit, if those things are happening i'll take it
let me talk more broadly, and then i'll talk specifically about the program you're referring to
as you know, the independent panel that i put together came back with a series of recommendations, 46 in total
i had an extensive meeting with them, down in the situation room, to review all the recommendations that they had made
i want to thank them publicly, because i think they did an excellent job and took my charge very seriously, which is, i told them i want you to look from to bottom at what we're doing and evaluate whether or not the current structures that we have and the current programs that we have are properly addressing both our continuing need to keep ourself secure and to prevent terrorist attacks or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or other threats to the homeland, and, are we also making sure that we're taking seriously the rule of law and our concerns about privacy and civil liberties
so what we're doing now is evaluating all the recommendations that have been made
over the next several weeks, i'm going to assess, based on conversations not just with the intelligence community, but others in government and outside of government, how we might apply and incorporate their recommendations
and i'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about all of this in january, where i'll be able to say, here are the recommendations that we think make sense
here are ones that we think are promising, but still need to be refined further
here's how it relates to the work we're doing, not just   not just internally, but also in partnership with other countries
and so i'm taking this very seriously, because i think, as i've said before, this is a debate that needed to be had
one specific program, the 215 program, is the metadata, the bulk collection of phone numbers and exchanges that have taken place that has probably gotten the most attention, at least with respect to domestic audiences
and what i've said in the past continues to be the case, which is that the nsa, in executing this program, believed, based on experiences from 9/11, that it was important for us to be able to track, if there was a phone number of a known terrorist outside of the united states calling into the united states, where that call might have gone, and that having that data in one place and retained for a certain period of time allowed them to be confident in pursuing various investigations and terrorist threats
and i think it's important to note that in all the reviews of this program that have been done, in fact, there have not been actual instances where it's been alleged that the nsa in some ways acted inappropriately in the use of this data
but what is also clear is, from the public debate, people are concerned about the prospect, the possibility of abuse, and i think that's what the judge in the district court suggested
and although his opinion obviously differs from rulings on the fisa court, we're taking those into account
the question we're going to have to ask is, can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the nsa is doing what it's supposed to be doing
i have confidence in the fact that the nsa is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but i also recognize that, as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers, that we may have to refine this further to give people more confidence
and i'm going to be working very hard on doing that
and we've got to provide more confidence to the international community
in some ways, what has been more challenging is the fact that we do have a lot of laws and checks and balances and safeguards and audits when it comes to making sure that the nsa and other intelligence agencies are not spying on americans
we've had less legal constraint in terms of what we're doing internationally
but i think part of what's been interesting about this whole exercise is recognizing that in a virtual world, some of these boundaries don't matter anymore
and just because we can do something doesn't mean we necessarily should
and the values that we've got as americans are ones that we have to be willing to apply beyond our borders, i think, perhaps more systematically than we've done in the past
well, hold on a second
i think it's important to note that, when it comes to the right balance on surveillance, these are a series of judgment calls that we're making every single day, because we've got a whole bunch of folks whose job it is to make sure that the american people are protected
and that's a hard job, because if something slips, then the question that's coming from you the next day at the press conferences, mr
president, why didn't you catch that, why   why did the intelligence people allow that to slip
isn't there a way that we could have found out that in fact this terrorist attack
now part of the challenge is, is that because of the manner in which these disclosures took place in dribs and drabs, oftentimes shaded in a particular way, and because of some of the constraints that we've had, in terms of declassifying information and getting it out there, that   that trust in how many safeguards exist and how these programs are run, has been diminished
so what's gonna be important is to build that back up
and i take that into account in weighing how we structure these programs
so let me just be very specific on the 215 program
it is possible, for example, that some of the same information that the intelligence community feels is required to keep people safe, can be obtained by having the private phone companies keep these records longer and to create some mechanism where they can be accessed in a   an effective fashion
that might cost more, there might need to be different checks on how those requests are made
there may be technological solutions that have to be found to do that
and the question that we're asking ourselves now is
does that make sense not only because of the fact that there are concerns about potential abuse down the road with the metadata that's being kept by a government, rather than private companies
but also does it make sense to do it because people right now are concerned that maybe their phone calls are being listened to, even if they're not
and we've got to factor that in
so, i   i   my point is that the environment has changed in ways that i think require us to take that into account
but the analysis that i've been doing throughout has always been, you know, periodically looking at what we're doing and asking ourselves
are we doing this in the right way
are we making sure that we're keeping the american safe, number one
are we also being true to our civil liberties and our privacy and our values
i understand
but what i'm saying is this, that yes, these are tough problems that i am glad to have the privilege of tackling
your initial question was whether the statements that i made six months ago are ones that i don't stand by
and what i'm saying is is that the statements i made then are entirely consistent with the statements that i make now, which is that
we believed that we had scrubbed these programs and struck an appropriate balance, and there had not been evidence   and there continues not to be evidence   that the particular program had been abused in how it was used
and, that it was a useful tool, working with other tools of the intelligence community has, to ensure that if we have a thread on a potential terrorist threat that, that can be followed effectively
what i have also said, though, is that in light of the disclosures that have taken place, it is clear that whatever benefits the configuration of this particular program may have, may be outweighed by the concerns that people have on its potential abuse
and, if that's the case, there may be another way of skinning the cat
so we just keep on going at this stuff and saying, can we do this better
can we do this more effectively
i think the panel's recommendations are consistent with that
so if you had a chance to read the overall recommendations, what they were very clear about is, we need this intelligence
we can't unilaterally disarm
there are ways we can do it potentially that gives people greater assurance that there are checks and balances, that there is sufficient oversight, sufficient transparency, programs like 215 could be re-designed in way that is give you the same information when you need it without creating these potentials for abuse
and that's exactly what he we should be doing is to evaluate all these things in a very clear, specific way
and moving forward on changes
well, there's no doubt that   that when it   when it came to the health care rollout, even though i was meeting every other week or every three weeks with folks and emphasizing how important it was that consumers had a good experience, an easy experience, in getting the information they needed, and knowing what the choices and options were for them to be able to get high-quality, affordable health care, the fact is, it didn't happen in the first month, the first six weeks, in a way that was at all acceptable
and, since i'm in charge, obviously we screwed it up
part of it, as i've said before, had to do with how it procurement generally is done, and it almost predates this year
part of it, obviously, has to do with the fact that there were not clear enough lines of authority in terms of who was in charge of the technology and cracking the whip on a whole bunch of contractors
so there are a whole bunch of things that we've been taking a look at
and i'm gonna be making appropriate adjustments, once we get through this year and we've gotten through the initial surge of people who've been signing up
but, you know, having said all that, bottom line also is, is that we've got several million people who are going to have health care that works
and it's not that i don't engage in a lot of self reflection here
i promise you, i probably beat myself up, you know, even worse than you
on any given day
but i've also got to wake up in the morning and make sure that i do better the next day and that we keep moving forward
and when i look at the landscape for next year, what i say to myself is, we're poised to do really good things
the economy is stronger than it has been in a very long time
our next challenge, then, is to make sure that everybody benefits from that, not just a few folks
and there are still too many people who haven't seen a raise and are still feeling financially insecure
we can get immigration reform done
we've got a concept that has bipartisan support
let's see if we can break through the politics on this
you know, i think that, hopefully, folks have learned their lesson in terms of brinksmanship coming out of the   coming out of the government shutdown
you know, there have been times where i've thought about, were there other ways that i could have prevented that   those three, four weeks that hampered the economy and hurt individual families who were not getting a paycheck during that time
absolutely
but i also think that, in some ways, given the pattern that we have been going through with house republicans for a while, we might have needed just a little bit of a bracing sort of recognition that this is not what the american people think is acceptable
they want us to try to solve problems and be practical, even if we can't get everything done
so, you know, the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see, what can you do better next year
that's how i intend to approach it
i'm sure that i will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun
oh, you know the answer to this question
no, we're not going to negotiate for congress to pay bills that it has accrued
here's the good news
i want   i want to emphasize the positive as we enter into this holiday season
i think congressman ryan and senator murray did a good job in trying to narrow the differences and actually pass a budget that i can sign
it's not everything that i would like, obviously
it buys back part of these across-the-board cuts of the so-called sequester, but not all of them, so we're still underfunding research, we're still underfunding education, we're still underfunding transportation and other initiatives that would create jobs right now
but, you know, it was an honest conversation
they operated in good faith
and given how far apart the parties have been on fiscal issues, they should take pride in what they did
and i actually called them after they struck the deal, and i said congratulations, and i hope that creates a good pattern for next year, where we work on at least the things we agree to, even if we agree to disagree on some of the other big-ticket items
i think immigration potentially falls in that category, where let's   here's an area where we've got bipartisan agreement
there are a few differences here and there, but the truth of the matter is, is that the senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skill workers who are doing great things in places like silicon valley and around the country
so let's go ahead and get that done
now, i can't imagine that having seen this possible daylight breaking when it comes to cooperation in congress that folks are thinking actually about plunging us back into the kinds of brinksmanship and governance by crisis that has done us so much harm over the last couple of years
to repeat
the debt ceiling is raised simply to pay bills that we have already accrued
it is not something that is a negotiating tool
it's not leverage
it's the responsibility of congress
it's part of doing their job
i expect them to do their job
although i'm happy to talk to them about any of the issues that they actually want to get done
so if congressman ryan is interested in tax reform, let's go
i've got some proposals on it
if he's interested in any issue out there, i'm willing to have a constructive conversation of the sort that we just had in resolving the budget issues
but i've got to assume folks aren't crazy enough to start that thing all over again
i said before   and i believe   that this is an important conversation that we needed to have
i have also said before that the way in which these disclosures happen have been damaging to the united states and damaging to our intelligence capabilities
and i think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage
i'll give you just one specific example
the fact of the matter is that the united states, for all our warts, is a country that abides by rule of law
that cares deeply about privacy
that cares about civil liberties
that cares about our constitution
and as a consequence of these disclosures, we've got countries who actually do the things that mr
snowden says he's worried about, very explicitly engaging in surveillance of their own citizens
targeting political dissidents
targeting and suppressing the press
who somehow are able to sit on the sidelines and act as if it's the united states that has problems when it comes to surveillance and intelligence operations
and that's a pretty distorted view of what's going on out there
so   so i think that as important and as necessary as this debate has been, it is also important to keep in mind that this has done unnecessary damage to u
intelligence capabilities and u
diplomacy
but i will leave it up to the courts and the attorney general to weigh in publicly on the specifics of mr
snowden's case
well, no, that's not true, because what we're talking about is a very specific population that received cancellation notices from insurance companies
the majority of them are either keeping their old plan because the grandfather clause has been extended further or they're finding a better deal in the marketplace, with better insurance for cheaper costs
but there may still be a subset, a significantly smaller subset than some of the numbers that have been advertised, that are still looking for options, are still concerned about what they're gonna be doing next year, and we just wanted to make sure that the hardship provision that was already existing in the law would also potentially apply to somebody who had problems during this transition period
so that's the specifics of this latest change here
you're making a broader point that   that i think is fair, and that is that in a big project like this, that what we are constantly doing is looking, is this working the way it's supposed to, and if there are adjustments that can be made to smooth out the transition, we should make them
but they don't go to the core of the law
first of all, the core of the law is, is that for 85% of the population, all they've been getting is free preventive care, better consumer protections, the ability to keep their kids on their insurance plan until they're 26, $1,000 or $500 discounts on prescription drugs for seniors on medicare
so 85 percent of the population, whether they know it or not over the last three years, have benefited from a whole set of the provisions of the law
and, by the way, if it were to be repealed, you would be taking away all of those benefits from   from folks who already are enjoying them
you had this sub-portion of the population, 15%, who either don't have health insurance or are buying it on the individual market
and that's still millions of people
and what we're doing is creating a marketplace where they can buy insurance and we can provide them some tax credits to help them afford it
the basic structure of that law is working
despite all the problems, despite the website problems, despite the messaging problems, despite all that, it's working
and, again, you don't have to take my word for it
we've got a couple million people who are going to have health insurance just in the first three months, despite the fact that probably the first month-and-a-half was lost because of problems with the website and about as bad a bunch of publicity as you could imagine, and yet you still got 2 million people who signed up, or more
and so what that means, then, is that the demand is there and, as i said before, the product is good
now, in putting something like this together, there going to be all kinds of problems that crop up, some of which may have been unanticipated, and what we've been trying to do is just respond to them in a commonsense way
and we're going to continue to try to do that
but that doesn't negate the fact that, you know, a year from now or two years for now, when we look back, we're going to be able to say that even more people have health insurance who didn't have it before, and that's not a bad thing
that's a good thing
that is part of the reason why i pushed so hard to get this law done in the first place
and, you know, i've said before, this is a messy process
and i think sometimes when i say that, people say, well, a
, yeah, it's real messy, and, b
, you know, isn't   isn't the fact that it's been so messy some indication that there   there are more fundamental problems with the law
and i guess what i'd say to that is, when you try to do something this big, affecting this many people, it's going to be hard
and every instance, whether it's social security, medicare, the prescription drug plan under president bush, it's   there hasn't been an instance where you've tried to really have an impact on the american people's lives and well-being, particularly in the health care arena, where you don't end up having some of these challenges
the question is going to be, ultimately, do we make good decisions trying to help as many people as possible in as efficient a way as possible
and i think that's what we're doing
well, keep in mind, first of all, that the majority of folks are going to have different options
this is essentially an additional net in case folks might have slipped through the cracks
we don't have precision on those numbers, but we expect it's going to be a relatively small number, because these are folks who want insurance and the vast majority of them have good options
and in a state like north carolina, for example, the overwhelming majority of them have just kept their own plans, so   the ones that they had previously
but we thought, and continue to think, that it makes sense that, as we are transitioning to a system in which insurance standards are higher, people don't have unpleasant surprises because they thought they had insurance until they hit a limit, and next thing you know, they still owe $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 for a hospital visit, that as we transition to higher standards, better insurance, that we also address folks who get caught in that transition and their unintended consequences
and, you know, the fact that we have got folks like billie jean king or brian boitano who themselves have been world-class athletes that everybody acknowledges for their excellence, but also for their character, who also happen to be members of the lgbt community, you should take that for   for what it's worth, that when it comes to the olympics and athletic performance, we do not make distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation
we judge people on how they perform, both on the court, and off the court, on the field, and off the field
they said that max baucus is going to be an outstanding ambassador to china, and i'd like a swift confirmation
and, my expectation and hope is that if both senate democrats, or if democrats and republicans in the house and the senate are serious about tax reform, then it's not going to depend on one guy
it's going to depend on all of us working together
and my office is ready, willing and eager to engage both parties in having a conversation about how we can simplify the tax code, make it fairer, make it work to create more jobs, and do right by middle-class americans
on the health care question, look, i think i've answered several times, this is a new iteration of it, but bottom line is that, you know, we are going to continue to work every single day to make sure that implementation of the health care law and the web site and all elements of it, including the grandfather clause, work better every single day
and, as i said in previous press conferences, you know, we're gonna make mistakes, and we're gonna have problems
but my intentions have been clear throughout, which is, i just want to help as many people as possible feel secure and make sure that they don't go broke when they get sick
and we're gonna just keep on doing that
on iran, there is the possibility of a resolution to a problem that has been a challenge for american national security for over a decade now, and that is getting iran to, in a verifiable fashion, not pursue a nuclear weapon
already, even with the interim deal that we struck in geneva, we had the first halt and in some cases some rollback of iran's nuclear capabilities
the first time that we've seen that in almost a decade
and we now have a structure in which we can have a very serious conversation to see is it possible for iran to get right with the international community in a verifiable fashion to give us all confidence that any peaceful nuclear program that they have is not gonna be weaponized in a way that threatens us or allies in the region, including israel
and as i've said before and i will repeat, it is very important for us to test whether that's possible, not because it's guaranteed, but because the alternative is possibly us having to engage in some sort of conflict to resolve the problem with all kinds of unintended consequences
now, i've been very clear from the start, i mean what i say
it is my goal to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but i sure would rather do it diplomatically
i'm keeping all options on the table, but if i can do it diplomatically, that's how we should do it
i would think that would be the preference of everybody up on capitol hill, because that sure is the preference of the american people
and we lose nothing during this negotiation period
precisely because there are verification provisions in place, we will have more insight into iran's nuclear program over the next six months than we have previously
we'll know if they are violating the terms of the agreement
they're not allowed to accelerate their stockpile of enriched uranium
in fact, they have to reduce their stockpile of highly-enriched uranium
ironically, if we did not have this six-month period in which we're testing whether we can get a comprehensive solution to this problem, they'd be advancing either further on their nuclear program
and in light of all that, what i've said to members of congress, democrats and republicans, is there is no need for new sanctions legislation
not yet
now, if iran comes back and says, we can't give you assurances that we're not going to weaponize, if they're not willing to address some of their capabilities that we know could end up resulting in them having breakout capacity, it's not going to be hard for us to turn the dials back, strengthen sanctions even further
i'll work with members of congress to put even more pressure on iran
but there's no reason to do it right now
and so i'm not surprised that there's been some talk from some members of congress about new sanctions
i think the politics of trying to look tough on iran are often good when you're running for office or if you're in office
but as president of the united states right now, who's been responsible over the last four years, with the help of congress, in putting together a comprehensive sanctions regime that was specifically designed to put pressure on them and bring them to the table to negotiate, what i'm saying to them, what i've said to the international community, and what i've said to the american people is, let's test it
now's the time to try to see if we can get this thing done
and i've heard some logic that says, well, mr
president, we're   we're supportive of the negotiations, but we think it's really useful to have this club hanging over iran's head
well, first of all, we still have the existing sanctions already in place that are resulting in iran losing billions of dollars every month in lost oil sales
we already have banking and financial sanctions that are still being applied even as the negotiations are taking place
it's not as if we're letting up on that
so i've heard arguments, well, but, you know, this way, we can be assured and the iranians will know that, if negotiations fail, even new and harsher sanctions will be put into place
listen, i don't think the iranians have any doubt that congress would be more than happy to pass more sanctions legislation
we can do that in a   in a day, on a dime
but if we're serious about negotiations, we've got to create an atmosphere in which iran is willing to move in ways that are uncomfortable for them, in contrary to their ideology and rhetoric and their instincts and their suspicions of us, and we don't help get them to a position where we can actually resolve this by engaging in this kind of   this kind of action
all right
ok, everybody
i think i'm going to take one more question, and that is it
i think the fact that john podesta's coming in will be terrific
he may deny it, but i've been trying to get him in here for quite some time
he ran my transition office
i asked him when he was running the transition office if he would be willing to join us, and at that time i think he was still feeling that he wanted to develop cap (ph) and other organizations
but john's a great strategist
he is as good as anybody on domestic policy
and i think he'll be a huge boost to us and give us more bandwidth to deal with more issues
i suspect that we may have additional announcements in the new year
you know, there's a natural turnover that takes place
people get tired
people get worn out
sometimes you need fresh legs
but what i can tell you is that the team i have now is tireless and shares my values, and believes the thing that i think i've repeated probably four or five times in this press conference, which is we get this incredible privilege for a pretty short period of time to do as much as we can for as many people as we can to help them live better lives
and that's what drives them
that's the sacrifice they make being away from families and soccer games and birthdays and some of them will end up working over christmas on issues like iran
and the fact that they make those kinds of sacrifices, i'm always grateful for
and if they then say to me after making those sacrifices for three, four, five years, you know, i need a break, you know, then i completely understand
oday, the change we seek swept through the chesapeake and over the potomac
we won the state of maryland
we won the commonwealth of virginia
and though we won in washington d
, this movement won't stop until there's change in washington
and tonight, we're on our way
but we know how much farther we have to go
we know it takes more than one night – or even one election – to overcome decades of money and the influence
bitter partisanship and petty bickering that's shut you out, let you down and told you to settle
we know our road will not be easy
but we also know that at this moment the cynics can no longer say our hope is false
we have now won east and west, north and south, and across the heartland of this country we love
we have given young people a reason to believe, and brought folks back to the polls who want to believe again
and we are bringing together democrats and independents and republicans
blacks and whites
latinos and asians
small states and big states
red states and blue states into a united states of america
this is the new american majority
this is what change looks like when it happens from the bottom up
and in this election, your voices will be heard
because at a time when so many people are struggling to keep up with soaring costs in a sluggish economy, we know that the status quo in washington just won't do
not this time
not this year
we can't keep playing the same washington game with the same washington players and expect a different result – because it's a game that ordinary americans are losing
it's a game where lobbyists write check after check and exxon turns record profits, while you pay the price at the pump, and our planet is put at risk
that's what happens when lobbyists set the agenda, and that's why they won't drown out your voices anymore when i am president of the united states of america
it's a game where trade deals like nafta ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage at wal-mart
that's what happens when the american worker doesn't have a voice at the negotiating table, when leaders change their positions on trade with the politics of the moment, and that's why we need a president who will listen to main street – not just wall street
a president who will stand with workers not just when it's easy, but when it's hard
it's a game where democrats and republicans fail to come together year after year after year, while another mother goes without health care for her sick child
that's why we have to put an end to the division and distraction in washington, so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose, a higher purpose
it's a game where the only way for democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting and voting like bush-mccain republicans, while our troops are sent to fight tour after tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged
that's what happens when we use 9/11 to scare up votes, and that's why we need to do more than end a war – we need to end the mindset that got us into war
that's the choice in this primary
it's about whether we choose to play the game, or whether we choose to end it
it's change that polls well, or change we can believe in
it's the past versus the future
and when i'm the democratic nominee for president – that will be the choice in november
john mccain is an american hero
we honor his service to our nation
but his priorities don't address the real problems of the american people, because they are bound to the failed policies of the past
george bush won't be on the ballot this november, but his war and his tax cuts for the wealthy will
when i am the nominee, i will offer a clear choice
john mccain won't be able to say that i ever supported this war in iraq, because i opposed it from the beginning
senator mccain said the other day that we might be mired for a hundred years in iraq, which is reason enough to not give him four years in the white house
if we had chosen a different path, the right path, we could have finished the job in afghanistan, and put more resources into the fight against bin laden
and instead of spending hundreds of billions of dollars in baghdad, we could have put that money into our schools and hospitals, our road and bridges – and that's what the american people need us to do right now
and i admired senator mccain when he stood up and said that it offended his conscience to support the bush tax cuts for the wealthy in a time of war
that he couldn't support a tax cut where so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate
but somewhere along the road to the republican nomination, the straight talk express lost its wheels, because now he's all for them
well i'm not
we can't keep spending money that we don't have in a war that we shouldn't have fought
we can't keep mortgaging our children's future on a mountain of debt
we can't keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the rest who struggle to keep pace
it's time to turn the page
we need a new direction in this country
everywhere i go, i meet americans who can't wait another day for change
they're not just showing up to hear a speech – they need to know that politics can make a difference in their lives, that it's not too late to reclaim the american dream
it's a dream shared in big cities and small towns
across races, regions and religions – that if you work hard, you can support a family
that if you get sick, there will be health care you can afford
that you can retire with the dignity and security and respect that you have earned
that your kids can get a good education, and young people can go to college even if they're not rich
that is our common hope
that is the american dream
it's the dream of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake at night wondering how he's going to pay the bills
he needs us to restore fairness to our economy by putting a tax cut into the pockets of working people, and seniors, and struggling homeowners
it's the dream of the woman who told me she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill
she needs us to finally come together to make health care affordable and available for every american
it's the dream of the senior i met who lost his pension when the company he gave his life to went bankrupt
he doesn't need bankruptcy laws that protect banks and big lenders
he needs us to protect pensions, not ceo bonuses
and to do what it takes to make sure that the american people can count on social security today, tomorrow and forever
it's the dream of the teacher who works at dunkin donuts after school just to make ends meet
she needs better pay, and more support, and the freedom to do more than just teach to the test
and if her students want to go on to college, they shouldn't fear decades of debt
that's why i'll make college affordable with an annual $4,000 tax credit if you're willing to do community service, or national service
we will invest in you, but we'll ask you to invest in your country
that is our calling in this campaign
to reaffirm that fundamental belief – i am my brother's keeper, i am my sister's keeper – that makes us one people, and one nation
it's time to stand up and reach for what's possible, because together, people who love their country can change it
now when i start talking like this, some folks tell me that i've got my head in the clouds
that i need a reality check
that we're still offering false hope
but my own story tells me that in the united states of america, there has never been anything false about hope
i should not be here today
i was not born into money or status
i was born to a teenage mom in hawaii, and my dad left us when i was two
but my family gave me love, they gave me education, and most of all they gave me hope – hope that in america, no dream is beyond our grasp if we reach for it, and fight for it, and work for it
because hope is not blind optimism
i know how hard it will be to make these changes
i know this because i fought on the streets of chicago as a community organizer to bring jobs to the jobless in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant
i've fought in the courts as a civil rights lawyer to make sure people weren't denied their rights because of what they looked like or where they came from
i've fought in the legislature to take power away from lobbyists
i've won some of those fights, but i've lost some of them too
i've seen good legislation die because good intentions weren't backed by a mandate for change
the politics of hope does not mean hoping things come easy
because nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody, somewhere stood up when it was hard
stood up when they were told – no you can't, and said yes we can
and where better to affirm our ideals than here in wisconsin, where a century ago the progressive movement was born
it was rooted in the principle that the voices of the people can speak louder than special interests
that citizens can be connected to their government and to one another
and that all of us share a common destiny, an american dream
yes we can reclaim that dream
yes we can heal this nation
the voices of the american people have carried us a great distance on this improbable journey, but we have much further to go
now we carry our message to farms and factories across this state, and to the cities and small towns of ohio, to the open plains deep in the heart of texas, and all the way to democratic national convention in denver
it's the same message we had when we were up, and when were down
that out of many, we are one
that our destiny will not be written for us, but by us
and that we can cast off our doubts and fears and cynicism because our dream will not be deferred
our future will not be denied
and our time for change has come
thank you ron pollack and thank you families usa for inviting me to speak here this morning
on this january morning of two thousand and seven, more than sixty years after president truman first issued the call for national health insurance, we find ourselves in the midst of an historic moment on health care
from maine to california, from business to labor, from democrats to republicans, the emergence of new and bold proposals from across the spectrum has effectively ended the debate over whether or not we should have universal health care in this country
plans that tinker and halfway measures now belong to yesterday
the president's latest proposal that does little to bring down cost or guarantee coverage falls into this category
there will be many others offered in the coming campaign, and i am working with experts to develop my own plan as we speak, but let's make one thing clear right here, right now
in the 2008 campaign, affordable, universal health care for every single american must not be a question of whether, it must be a question of how
we have the ideas, we have the resources, and we must find the will to pass a plan by the end of the next president's first term
i know there's a cynicism out there about whether this can happen, and there's reason for it
every four years, health care plans are offered up in campaigns with great fanfare and promise
but once those campaigns end, the plans collapse under the weight of washington politics, leaving the rest of america to struggle with skyrocketing costs
for too long, this debate has been stunted by what i call the smallness of our politics - the idea that there isn't much we can agree on or do about the major challenges facing our country
and when some try to propose something bold, the interests groups and the partisans treat it like a sporting event, with each side keeping score of who's up and who's down, using fear and divisiveness and other cheap tricks to win their argument, even if we lose our solution in the process
well we can't afford another disappointing charade in 2008
it's not only tiresome, it's wrong
wrong when businesses have to layoff one employee because they can't afford the health care of another
wrong when a parent cannot take a sick child to the doctor because they cannot afford the bill that comes with it
wrong when 46 million americans have no health care at all
in a country that spends more on health care than any other nation on earth, it's just wrong
and yet, in recent years, what's caught the attention of those who haven't always been in favor of reform is the realization that this crisis isn't just morally offensive, it's economically untenable
for years, the can't-do crowd has scared the american people into believing that universal health care would mean socialized medicine and burdensome taxes - that we should just stay out of the way and tinker at the margins
you know the statistics
family premiums are up by nearly 87% over the last five years, growing five times faster than workers' wages
deductibles are up 50%
co-payments for care and prescriptions are through the roof
nearly 11 million americans who are already insured spent more than a quarter of their salary on health care last year
and over half of all family bankruptcies today are caused by medical bills
but they say it's too costly to act
almost half of all small businesses no longer offer health care to their workers, and so many others have responded to rising costs by laying off workers or shutting their doors for good
some of the biggest corporations in america, giants of industry like gm and ford, are watching foreign competitors based in countries with universal health care run circles around them, with a gm car containing twice as much health care cost as a japanese car
but they say it's too risky to act
they tell us it's too expensive to cover the uninsured, but they don't mention that every time an american without health insurance walks into an emergency room, we pay even more
our family's premiums are $922 higher because of the cost of care for the uninsured
we pay $15 billion more in taxes because of the cost of care for the uninsured
and it's trapped us in a vicious cycle
as the uninsured cause premiums to rise, more employers drop coverage
as more employers drop coverage, more people become uninsured, and premiums rise even further
but the skeptics tell us that reform is too costly, too risky, too impossible for america
well the skeptics must be living somewhere else
because when you see what the health care crisis is doing to our families, to our economy, to our country, you realize that caution is what's costly
inaction is what's risky
doing nothing is what's impossible when it comes to health care in america
it's time to act
this isn't a problem of money, this is a problem of will
a failure of leadership
we already spend $2
2 trillion a year on health care in this country
my colleague, senator ron wyden, who's recently developed a bold new health care plan of his own, tells it this way
for the money americans spent on health care last year, we could have hired a group of skilled physicians, paid each one of them $200,000 to care for just seven families, and guaranteed every single american quality, affordable health care
so where's all that money going
we know that a quarter of it - one out of every four health care dollars - is spent on non-medical costs
mostly bills and paperwork
and we also know that this is completely unnecessary
almost every other industry in the world has saved billions on these administrative costs by doing it all online
every transaction you make at a bank now costs them less than a penny
even at the veterans administration, where it used to cost nine dollars to pull up your medical record, new technology means you can call up the same record on the internet for next to nothing
but because we haven't updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a single transaction still costs up to twenty-five dollars - not one dime of which goes toward improving the quality of our health care
this is simply inexcusable, and if we brought our entire health care system online, something everyone from ted kennedy to newt gingrich believes we should do, we'd already be saving over $600 million a year on health care costs
the federal government should be leading the way here
if you do business with the federal employee health benefits program, you should move to an electronic claims system
if you are a provider who works with medicare, you should have to report your patient's health outcomes, so that we can figure out, on a national level, how to improve health care quality
these are all things experts tell us must be done but aren't being done
and the federal government should lead
another, more controversial area we need to look at is how much of our health care spending is going toward the record-breaking profits earned by the drug and health care industry
it's perfectly understandable for a corporation to try and make a profit, but when those profits are soaring higher and higher each year while millions lose their coverage and premiums skyrocket, we have a responsibility to ask why
at a time when businesses are facing increased competition and workers rarely stay with one company throughout their lives, we also have to ask if the employer-based system of health care itself is still the best for providing insurance to all americans
we have to ask what we can do to provide more americans with preventative care, which would mean fewer doctor's visits and less cost down the road
we should make sure that every single child who's eligible is signed up for the children's health insurance program, and the federal government should make sure that our states have the money to make that happen
and we have to start looking at some of the interesting ideas on comprehensive reform that are coming out of states like maine and illinois and california, to see what we can replicate on a national scale and what will move us toward that goal of universal coverage for all
but regardless of what combination of policies and proposals get us to this goal, we must reach it
we must act
and we must act boldly
as one health care advocate recently said, the most expensive course is to do nothing
but it wasn't a liberal democrat or union leader who said this
it was the president of the very health industry association that funded the harry and louise ads designed to kill the clinton health care plan in the early nineties
the debate in this country over health care has shifted
the support for comprehensive reform that organizations like families usa have worked so hard to build is now widespread, and the diverse group of business and health industry interests that are part of your health care coverage coalition is a testament to that success
and so washington no longer has an excuse for caution
leaders no longer have a reason to be timid
and america can no longer afford inaction
that's not who we are - and that's not the story of our nation's improbable progress
half a century ago, america found itself in the midst of another health care crisis
for millions of elderly americans, the single greatest cause of poverty and hardship was the crippling cost of health care and the lack of affordable insurance
two out of every three elderly americans had annual incomes of less than $1,000, and only one in eight had health insurance
as health care and hospital costs continued to rise, more and more private insurers simply refused to insure our elderly, believing they were too great of a risk to care for
the resistance to action was fierce
proponents of health care reform were opposed by well-financed, well-connected interest groups who spared no expense in telling the american people that these efforts were dangerous and un-american, revolutionary and even deadly
and yet the reformers marched on
they testified before congress and they took their case to the country and they introduced dozens of different proposals but always, always they stood firm on their goal to provide health care for every american senior
and finally, after years of advocacy and negotiation and plenty of setbacks, president lyndon johnson signed the medicare bill into law on july 30th of 1965
the signing ceremony was held in missouri, in a town called independence, with the first man who was bold enough to issue the call for universal health care - president harry truman
and as he stood with truman by his side and signed what would become the most successful government program in history - a program that had seemed impossible for so long - president johnson looked out at the crowd and said, history shapes men, but it is a necessary faith of leadership that men can help shape history
never forget that we have it within our power to shape history in this country
it is not in our character to sit idly by as victims of fate or circumstance, for we are a people of action and innovation, forever pushing the boundaries of what's possible
now is the time to push those boundaries once more
we have come so far in the debate on health care in this country, but now we must finally answer the call first issued by truman, advanced by johnson, and fought for by so many leaders and americans throughout the last century
the time has come for universal health care in america
and i look forward to working with all of you to meet this challenge in the weeks and months to come
my fellow americans, michelle and i have been so touched by all the well-wishes that we've received over the past few weeks
but tonight it's my turn to say thanks
whether we have seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the american people  in living rooms and in schools
at farms and on factory floors
at diners and on distant military outposts  those conversations are what have kept me honest, and kept me inspired, and kept me going
and every day, i have learned from you
you made me a better president, and you made me a better man
so i first came to chicago when i was in my early twenties, and i was still trying to figure out who i was
still searching for a purpose to my life
and it was a neighborhood not far from here where i began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills
now this is where i learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and they come together to demand it
after eight years as your president, i still believe that
and it's not just my belief
it's the beating heart of our american idea  our bold experiment in self-government
it's the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
it's the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing
that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect union
what a radical idea, the great gift that our founders gave to us
the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, and toil, and imagination  and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good
for 240 years, our nation's call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation
it's what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom
it's what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the rio grande
it's what pushed women to reach for the ballot
it's what powered workers to organize
it's why gis gave their lives at omaha beach and iwo jima
iraq and afghanistan and why men and women from selma to stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well
so that's what we mean when we say america is exceptional
not that our nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow
yes, our progress has been uneven
the work of democracy has always been hard
it has been contentious
sometimes it has been bloody
for every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back
but the long sweep of america has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some
but that's what we did
that's what you did
you were the change
the answer to people's hopes and, because of you, by almost every measure, america is a better, stronger place than it was when we started
in 10 days the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy
no, no, no, no, no
the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next
i committed to president-elect trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as president bush did for me
because it's up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face
we have what we need to do so
we have everything we need to meet those challenges
after all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on earth
our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours
but that potential will only be realized if our democracy works
only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people
only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now
and that's what i want to focus on tonight, the state of our democracy
understand democracy does not require uniformity
our founders argued, they quarreled, and eventually they compromised
they expected us to do the same
but they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity
the idea that, for all our outward differences, we're all in this together, that we rise or fall as one
there have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity
and the beginning of this century has been one of those times
a shrinking world, growing inequality, demographic change, and the specter of terrorism
these forces haven't just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well
and how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland
in other words, it will determine our future
to begin with, our democracy won't work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity
the wealthy are paying a fair share of taxes
even as the stock market shatters records, the unemployment rate is near a 10-year low
the uninsured rate has never, ever been lower
that's the economic argument
but stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic idea
while the top 1 percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many of our families in inner cities and in rural counties have been left behind
the laid off factory worker, the waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills
convinced that the game is fixed against them
that their government only serves the interest of the powerful
that's a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics
now there're no quick fixes to this long-term trend
i agree, our trade should be fair and not just free
but the next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas
it will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle class jobs obsolete
and so we're going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need
we can argue about how to best achieve these goals
but we can't be complacent about the goals themselves
for if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come
there's a second threat to our democracy
and this one is as old as our nation itself
after my election there was talk of a post-racial america
and such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic
race remains a potent
but laws alone won't be enough
hearts must change
it won't change overnight
social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change
but if our democracy is to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in american fiction, atticus finch, who said you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it
for blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face
