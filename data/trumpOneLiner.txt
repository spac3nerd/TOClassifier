thank you so much
that's so nice
isn't he a great guy
he doesn't get a fair press
he doesn't get it
it's just not fair
and i have to tell you i'm here, and very strongly here, because i have great respect for steve king and have great respect likewise for citizens united, david and everybody, and tremendous resect for the tea party
also, also the people of iowa
they have something in common
hard-working people
they want to work, they want to make the country great
i love the people of iowa
so that's the way it is
very simple
with that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job
the world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused
our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and i think i was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible
in any event, washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray
very simple
politicians are all talk, no action
they are all talk and no action
and it's constant
it never ends
and i'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and i'm a republican
and i'm very disappointed by our republican politicians
because they let the president get away with absolute murder
you see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to
nothing ever happens
nothing ever happens
you look at obamacare
a total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster
people are closing up shops
doctors are quitting the business
i have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy
he said, i have more accountants than i have patients
and he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business
and he was very successful guy
but it's happening more and more
look at obamacare with a $5 billion website
i have many websites, many, many websites
they're all over the place
but for $10, okay
now everything about obamacare was a lie
it was a filthy lie
and when you think about it, lies, i mean are they prosecuted
does anyone do anything
and what are the republican politicians doing about it
he lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect
you can keep your plan
and you've all heard that hundreds of times
that's like the real estate location, location
i don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location
but you have heard this about obamacare
and it's disgraceful
it's a big, fat, horrible lie
your deductibles are going through the roof
you're not going to get unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage
and people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore
so it's a real, real disaster
and somebody has to repeal and replace obamacare
and they have to do it fast and not just talk about it
now, we have to build a fence
and it's got to be a beauty
who can build better than trump
i build
it's what i do
i build
i build nice fences, but i build great buildings
fences are easy, believe me
i saw the other day on television people just walking across the border
they're walking
the military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country
it is so terrible
it is so unfair
it is so incompetent
and we don't have the best coming in
we have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks
you can certainly have terrorists
you can certainly have islamic terrorists
you can have anything coming across the border
we don't do anything about it
so i would say that if i run and if i win, i would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border
again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it
benghazi
oh, benghazi, benghazi
everything is benghazi
what happens
nothing
irs, e-mails
i get sued all the time, okay
i run a big business
you know i've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful
i have done so many deals
almost all of them have been tremendously successful
you'll see that when i file my statements
i mean you will see
you will be very proud of me, okay
but i've always said, and i said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president
because you've done so much
you've beaten so many people
you've created so many   look, obama, what did he do
no deal
he never did a deal
he did one deal
a house
and if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay
he got away with murder
but i can tell you, e-mails
irs, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost
they were lost
if you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost
they can't be lost
so why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are
they talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border
that's the end of it
believe me if i did something you would have a border that would be great
but they talk about it
and then you have a president that does an executive order
nobody even heard of an executive order
he does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders
why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time
he said, i'm going to approve this and that why didn't our republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier
instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, i know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it
we'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed
so we have to do something
jobs
china
i mean i've made so much money fighting against the chinese
one of the best deals i ever did was against the chinese, and they respect me for it
and i know them
and they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with
we can't believe how stupid your leaders are
they tell me that
now they don't know i'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not
but they tell me that
and by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much goods, i mean the goods you sell are incredible
i don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries
the euro, china is going crazy with the devaluation
i never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing
they are devaluing down to nothing
and what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product
it's going make it impossible for you to compete
and they're getting away with it
and they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it
but you watch this devaluation of all of it
i mean the euro, china, mexico
everybody is devaluing
and when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good
you know it's one of those things, sounds good
be very careful
be very careful
because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing
they have it set
don't forget another thing
china became the number one economic power a year ago
that was unthinkable
to think that that was going to happen
it was absolutely unthinkable
so it happened and it's very, very sad
now we spent $2 trillion in iraq
we got nothing
they don't even respect us
they don't even care about us
until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us
we want you out
then all of the sudden a new group forms, isis
by the way, you know how they formed
they took the oil
and for those of you that know and love donald trump there are some of you have i been saying for four years, keep the oil
so now isis has the oil
and the stuff that isis doesn't have, iran is going to take
so we get nothing
we have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have
i mean i walk down the streets of new york and i see so many wounded warriors, incredible people
and we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military
but, and we have to do it fast
we have to do it fast
we have incompetent people
they put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing
it needs money
we have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save social security
'cause i'm not a cutter
i'll probably be the only republican that does not want to cut social security
i'm not a cutter of social security
i want to make the country rich so that social security can be afforded, and medicare and medicaid
get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your social security
you've been paying your security
and like, i like congressman ryan, i like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting social security, and by the way the democrats are eating your lunch on this issue
it's an issue that you're not going to win
you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things
now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons
we really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast
we can't let iran get a nuclear weapon
we can't do it
can't do it
we cannot let that happen
you know in the old days, i would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other
here we are in syria
we're fighting people that want to overturn syria
think of this
we're fighting isis, but isis wants to overturn the government
maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay
but think of it
think of it
isis is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want syria to fall
there are so many things
there are so many things
but the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear
nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles
you can take out the east coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable
the power
and we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens
we've never had this before
we have a situation in afghanistan
we're spending tremendous amounts of money there
we're trying to do the right thing
we have leadership, again no leadership respects us
you know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find
the same thing is happening there
and i never knew that afghanistan until a year ago or so, afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals
and we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain china is taking out all the minerals
they're taking it out
trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals
so we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker
it's really, really crazy
so we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country
if we don't   the other day in ohio a bridge collapsed
bridges are collapsing all over the country
the reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure
i go to saudi arabia, i go to dubai
i am doing big jobs in dubai
i go to various different places
i go to china
they are building a bridge on every corner
they have bridges that make the george washington bridge like small time stuff
they're building the most incredible things you have ever seen
they are building airports in qatar which they like to say cutter but i've always said qatar so i'll keep it qatar what the hell
but they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen
and then i come back to laguardia where the runways have potholes
the place is falling apart
you go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart
and they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt
so you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place
this is inside, not outside
and i just left dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen
in fact my pilot said oh mr
trump this is such an honor
i said it's not an honor
they're just smart
but you look at lax, and you look at kennedy airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling
you look at all of the things that are bad   i'll give you an example
and this isn't part of what i was going to say, but i ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails
you know the guard rails
the ones that sort of go like this  that are always  bent, rusted and horrible
did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes
now they've been selling this thing for 25 years
why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works
because they don't know
they don't know what's happening
somebody made a lot of money on that
they don't know what is happening
so we have to make our country great again
we have to rebuild our country
and we have a long way to go
we are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money
now we owe it to the chinese, a lot of it
we owe it to other countries
they're the ones that hold the debt
and then we give them money
we have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies
i just ordered thousands of television sets and between lg and samsung and i mean you know   no american company comes to see and comes to bid
it's south korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them
what are we doing
why aren't they paying us
why aren't they paying us
what are we doing
i order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's south korea
you know whether it's china, south korea, but in this case televisions, south korea
why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on
now, we have a very important election coming up
we have a presidential election coming up
and we have some good people
nobody like trump of course, but these are minor details
we have some good people
it' can't be mitt because mitt ran and failed
he failed
i mean i liked him
look like him, dislike him the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away
the romneycare from massachusetts, that's not going away
what do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time
it's not fair because it was a long t   that doesn't work
but more importantly, he choked
something happened to him in the last month
he had that election won
and let me tell you something
that election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal
i know many of those guys
they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah i can't close it
or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament
and there are many of them
most people are like that
i mean most people are like that
you can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually i think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president
i really do
i think beating obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true
so you can't have romney
he choked
you can't have bush
the last thing we need is another bush
now i made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing   you know they copied it
i'll be accused of copying the statement
that's the bad thing
but i said it
i was the one that said it first, and i mean it
the last thing we need is another bush
now, he's totally in favor of common core
that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that
but he's totally in favor of common core
he's very, very weak on immigration
don't forget remember his statement they come for love
i say, what
come for love
you've got these people coming, half of them are criminals
they're coming for love
they're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love
and when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us obama
i was never a big fan, but his brother gave us obama
'cause abraham lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months
and then he appointed justice roberts
and jeb wanted justice roberts
and justice roberts basically approved obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes
so you can't have jeb bush
and he's going to lose aside from that
he's not going to win
so mitt and you just can't have those two
that's it
that's it
it's so simple
so just in summing up and i just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important
and i watch these teleprompters, and by the way i think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters
and people say, oh he is so quick on his feet
he is reading it
i mean give me a break
everything is read
you don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk
and that's what we ended up getting the king of teleprompters
but, so when i look at these things here i say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing
no problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that
but we have to do something about these teleprompters
but in looking at these situations   i built an incredible company
and you'll see that
an incredible company
a wonderful company
i employ thousands of people and i love doing what i'm doing
and in a certain way, i wish i weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix
we have such great potential
so if i run for president and if i win, i would totally succeed in
creating jobs
defeating isis and stopping the islamic terrorists and you have to do that
reducing the budget deficit so important, have to do it
securing our southern border and i mean seriously securing it
stopping nuclear weapons in iran and elsewhere
saving social security, medicare and medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it
repealing obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country
and believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody
and everybody can be covered
i'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out
everybody can be c  this plan is just a basic disaster
nobody knows
as bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is
fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports
and that, i can tell you, nobody is close to trump
i just got the best hotel in north america
i'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one
i'm building one of the great hotels of the world on pennsylvania avenue, right opposite the white house, between the white house and congress
right on penn
the  old post office site, and i got it from obama
do you believe that
and everybody wanted it
so, i can't believe it myself
but it's going to be fantastic
and so many other things
i know what needs to be done to make america great again
we can make this country great again
the potential is enormous
and i am serious thinking of running for president because i can do the job
thank you all very much
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
beautiful
thank you
thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the center for national interest for honoring me with this invitation
it truly is a great honor
i'd like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace
it's time to shake the rust off america's foreign policy
it's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do
the direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle
my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security above all else
it has to be first
has to be
that will be the foundation of every single decision that i will make
america first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration
but to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back
we have a lot to be proud of
in the 1940s we saved the world
the greatest generation beat back the nazis and japanese imperialists
then we saved the world again
this time, from totalitarianism and communism
the cold war lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big
democrats and republicans working together got mr
gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall
history will not forget what he did
a very special man and president
unfortunately, after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly off course
we failed to develop a new vision for a new time
in fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense
logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another
they just kept coming and coming
we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya, to president obama's line in the sand in syria
each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper
very bad
it all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy
we tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed
civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted
horribly wasted
many trillions of dollars were lost as a result
the vacuum was created that isis would fill
iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment
they have benefited so much, so sadly, for us
our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster
no vision
no purpose
no direction
no strategy
today i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy
first, our resources are totally over extended
president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy
he's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders
our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year
we're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own
ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength
i am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem
i'm the only one  believe me, i know them all, i'm the only one who knows how to fix it
secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and i've been talking about this recently a lot
our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden
but many of them are simply not doing so
they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us
in nato, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides america, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of gdp on defense
we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia
the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the u
must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves
we have no choice
the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security
a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully
thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us
we've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we've never seen before in the history of our country
he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry
iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed
remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon
and under a trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon
all of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors  so vividly i remember that day
in negotiation, you must be willing to walk
the iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table
when the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win  you just can't win
at the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them
you've made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place
president obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic
he supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel, and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place
israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity
just a few days ago, vice president biden again criticized israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region
president obama has not been a friend to israel
he has treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power
iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we've done
all of the expense and all at the expense of israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the united states itself
we've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help
remember that
not good
fourth, our rivals no longer respect us
in fact, they're just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don't take us seriously anymore
the truth is they don't respect us
when president obama landed in cuba on air force one, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him
perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one
then amazingly, the same thing happened in saudi arabia
it's called no respect
absolutely no respect
do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen, denmark, to get the olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the united states came in fourth  fourth place
the president of the united states making this trip  unprecedented  comes in fourth place
he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment
we were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times
the list of humiliations go on and on and on
president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach
our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to rein in north korea
we have the leverage
we have the power over china, economic power, and people don't understand it
and with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea, which is totally out of control
he has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the united states and its companies
we've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do
they do at will
it always happens
if president obama's goal had been to weaken america, he could not have done a better job
finally, america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals
since the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy
one day, we're bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians
the next day, we're watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart
lives lost, massive moneys lost
the world is a different place
we're a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the obama-clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess
we've made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever before
we left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide
we have done nothing to help the christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action
our actions in iraq, libya and syria have helped unleash isis, and we're in a war against radical islam, but president obama won't even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem
hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country
after secretary clinton's failed intervention in libya, islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans
then, instead of taking charge that night, hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep
incredible
clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie
our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation
and, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning
and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil
and you know what
we don't blockade, we don't bomb, we don't do anything about it
it's almost as if our country doesn't even know what's happening, which could be a fact and could be true
this will all change when i become president
to our friends and allies, i say america is going to be strong again
america is going to be reliable again
it's going to be a great and reliable ally again
it's going to be a friend again
we're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies
we're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world
our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge
we need a new rational american foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties  democrats, republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies
this is how we won the cold war and it's how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if i become president
first, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islam
containing the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states and indeed the world
events may require the use of military force, but it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the cold war
in this, we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical islamic violence, attacks and everything else
it is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been
we should work  thank you
we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam
but this has to be a two-way street
they must also be good to us
remember that
they have to be good to us, no longer one way
it's now two-way
and remember, us and all we're doing, they have to appreciate what we've done to them
we're going to help, but they have to appreciate what we've done for them
the struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland
there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism
for every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more
we must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies
we have no idea where these people are coming from
there's no documentation
there's no paperwork
there's nothing
we have to be smart
we have to be vigilant
a pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next san bernardino or frankly, much worse
all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country
worse than pearl harbor because you take a look at what's happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked  one of the true great catastrophes
and then there's isis
i have a simple message for them
their days are numbered
i won't tell them where and i won't tell them how
we must
we must as a nation be more unpredictable
we are totally predictable
we tell everything
we're sending troops
we tell them
we're sending something else
we have a news conference
we have to be unpredictable
and we have to be unpredictable starting now
but they're going to be gone
isis will be gone if i'm elected president
and they'll be gone quickly
they will be gone very, very quickly
secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy
the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what's happened to us
our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal
and it has to happen immediately
our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1
3 million today
the navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time
the air force is about one-third smaller than 1991
pilots flying b-52s in combat missions today
these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room
and what are we doing about this
president obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011
our military is depleted and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming
we will spend what we need to rebuild our military
it is the cheapest, single investment we can make
we will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind
our military dominance must be unquestioned, and i mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody
but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely
in this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem
but i do
no one dollar can be wasted
not one single dollar can we waste
we're also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again
and to put americans first again
this will ensure that our own workers, right here in america, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again
so, so important
we need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge
this includes 3d printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare
a great country also takes care of its warriors
our commitment to them is absolute, and i mean absolute
a trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve
and the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life
our veterans
our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly
these are our great people and we must treat them fairly
we must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the trump administration
finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests
businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries
look at what happened in the 1990s
our embassies in kenya and tanzania  and this was a horrible time for us  were attacked
and 17 brave sailors were killed on the u
cole
and what did we do
it seemed we put more effort into adding china into the world trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the united states
frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda
we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didn't do it
and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon
again, the worst attack on our country in its history
our foreign policy goals must be based on america's core national security interests
and the following will be my priorities
in the middle east our goals must be, and i mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change
we need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies
and believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy
we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them
and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends
we desire to live peacefully and in friendship with russia and china
we have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries
we should seek common ground based on shared interests
russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism
i believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible
common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon
good for both countries
some say the russians won't be reasonable
i intend to find out
if we can't make a deal under my administration, a deal that's great  not good, great  for america, but also good for russia, then we will quickly walk from the table
it's as simple as that
we're going to find out
fixing our relations with china is another important step  and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time
china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect
we have a massive trade deficit with china, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and i mean quickly, to balance
a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china, better than we have right now
look at what china is doing in the south china sea
they're not supposed to be doing it
no respect for this country or this president
we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways
if need be, that's what's going to have to happen
after i'm elected president, i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies
in these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges
for instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade nato's outdated mission and structure, grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges, including migration and islamic terrorism
i will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative
but if america fights, it must only fight to win
i will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and i mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital v
our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction
the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy
with president obama and secretary clinton we've had the exact opposite  a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake
after losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the middle east than ever, ever before
i challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of obama/clinton
it has been a complete and total disaster
i will also be prepared to deploy america's economic resources
financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination
our power will be used if others do not play by the rules
in other words, if they do not treat us fairly
our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand, i will enforce that line in the sand
believe me
however, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct
you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy
a superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength
although not in government service, i was totally against the war in iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east
sadly, i was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been iran, who is systematically taking over iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades
and now, to top it off, we have isis
my goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations
that's why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war
we have to look to new people
we have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the new york times or being watched on television
finally, i will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions
instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions
these are my goals as president
i will seek a foreign policy that all americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome
the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that's what we want
we want them to be our allies
we want the world to be  we want to bring peace to the world
too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons
the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world
to achieve these goals, americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership
again, many americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own
americans
americans must know that we're putting the american people first again on trade
so true
on trade, on immigration, on foreign policy
the jobs, incomes and security of the american worker will always be my first priority
no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first
both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same
we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism
the nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony
i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never enter
and under my administration, we will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs
nafta, as an example, has been a total disaster for the united states and has emptied our states  literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs
and i've just gotten to see it
i've toured pennsylvania
i've toured new york
i've toured so many of the states
they have been cleaned out
their manufacturing is gone
never again, only the reverse  and i have to say this strongly  never again
only the reverse will happen
we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones
there will be consequences for the companies that leave the united states only to exploit it later
they fire the people
they take advantage of the united states
there will be consequences for those companies
never again
under a trump administration, no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country
i will view as president the world through the clear lens of american interests
i will be america's greatest defender and most loyal champion
we will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are
the world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongest
america will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker
we will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make america strong again
and always  always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make america respected again
we must make america truly wealthy again
and we must  we have to and we will make america great again
and if we do that  and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known
thank you very much, everybody
i appreciate it
thank you
a hand with little fingers coming out of a stem
like, little
look at my hands
they're fine
nobody other than graydon carter years ago used to use that
my hands are normal hands
during a debate, he was losing, and he said, oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means
this was not me
this was rubio that said, he has small hands and you know what that means
okay
so, he started it
so, what i said a couple of days later  and what happened is i was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, mr
trump, you have strong hands
you have good-sized hands
and then another one would say, you have great hands, mr
trump, i had no idea
i said, what do you mean
he said, i thought you were like deformed, and i thought you had small hands
i had fifty people  is that a correct statement
i mean people were writing, how are mr
trump's hands
my hands are fine
you know, my hands are normal
slightly large, actually
in fact, i buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay
no, but i did this because everybody was saying to me, oh, your hands are very nice
they are normal
so rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say  now i was hitting him pretty hard
he wanted to do his don rickles stuff and it didn't work out
obviously, it didn't work too well
but one of the things he said was he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else
you can look it up
i didn't say it
i don't want people to go around thinking that i have a problem
i'm telling you, ruth, i had so many people
i would say 25, 30 people would tell me  every time i'd shake people's hand, oh, you have nice hands
why shouldn't i
and, by the way, by saying that i solved the problem
nobody questions  i even held up my hands, and said, look, take a look at that hand
i don't know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not
he said, ‘donald trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else
' i didn't say that
and all i did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when christie made him look bad, i gave him the– a little recap and i said, and i said, and i had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because i thought he was going to faint
and everybody took it fine
whether it was presidential or not i can't tell you
i can just say that what he said was a lie
and everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands
after i said that, they never did
and then i held up the hand, i showed people the hand
you know, when i've got a big audience
so yeah, i think it's not a question of presidential
oh boy
we love nevada
we love nevada
thank you
thank you
oh this is a great place
thank you very much
great evening
we will be celebrating for a long time tonight
have a good time
have a good time
you know we weren't expectinga couple of months ago, we weren't expecting to win this one, you know that, right
we weren't
of course if you listen to the pundits, we weren't expected to win too much, and now we're winning, winning, winning the country
and soon the country's going to start winning, winning, winning
so i want to thank the volunteers
they've been unbelievable
these people, they work like endlessly, endlessly
we're not going to forget it

we love florida so
we're going to do very well in ohio
we're beating the governor
it's always nice to be beating the governor
and michiganthe whole thing
it's going to be an amazing two months
we might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest
so tonight we had 45 to 46%, and tomorrow you'd hear them say, you know, if they could just take the other candidates and add them up, and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%
so if they couldthey keep forgetting that when people drop out, we're going to get a lot of votes
you know they keep forgetting
so i want to begin by thanking my boys, eric has been all over the place making speeches
he's getting better than me so i'm a little jealous
and don went to , you were all over, right

we're going to have our borders nice and strong
we're going to build the wall, you know that
we're going to build the wall
and i have a lot of respect from mexico, and you just heard we won hispanics
but let me tell you mexico is going to pay for the wall, right
it's going to happen
it's going to happen
they know it
i know it
we all know it
we have a tremendous deficit
we have a trade deficit with mexico
they'll pay for the wall
they'll be very happy about it
believe me
i'll talk to them
they're going to be very, very thrilled
they're going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall
we're going to be the smart people
we're not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place
we're going to be the smart people
you're going to be proud of your president, and you're going to be even prouder of your country, ok
so tonight folks, this was a great evening
i love this place
i love this state
i love las vegas
i have spent and invested so much money over here
trump international hoteli keep telling steve we have the best hotel in las vegas
he's fighting me all the time
but that's ok
but i just want to say it's a great state, and they have great people
and i was so proud
you know, i went to caucus
i was all over the place tonight
the people are amazing
the enthusiasm, it was unbelievable to see
the people of this country are absolutely amazing
i love you folks very much
remember
make america great again
we're going to do it, and it's going to happen fast
thank you very much everybody
we love you
we love you
wow
whoa
that is some group of people
thousands
so nice, thank you very much
that's really nice
thank you
it's great to be at trump tower
it's great to be in a wonderful city, new york
and it's an honor to have everybody here
this is beyond anybody's expectations
there's been no crowd like this
and, i can tell, some of the candidates, they went in
they didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work
they sweated like dogs
they didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there
how are they going to beat isis
i don't think it's gonna happen
our country is in serious trouble
we don't have victories anymore
we used to have victories, but we don't have them
when was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, china in a trade deal
they kill us
i beat china all the time
all the time
when did we beat japan at anything
they send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do
when was the last time you saw a chevrolet in tokyo
it doesn't exist, folks
they beat us all the time
when do we beat mexico at the border
they're laughing at us, at our stupidity
and now they are beating us economically
they are not our friend, believe me
but they're killing us economically
the u
has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems
thank you
it's true, and these are the best and the finest
when mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best
they're not sending you
they're not sending you
they're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us
they're bringing drugs
they're bringing crime
they're rapists
and some, i assume, are good people
oh and it only makes common sense
it only makes common sense
they're sending us not the right people
it's coming from more than mexico
it's coming from all over south and latin america, and it's coming probably  probably  from the middle east
but we don't know
because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening
and it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast
islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the middle east
they've become rich
i'm in competition with them
they just built a hotel in syria
can you believe this
they built a hotel
when i have to build a hotel, i pay interest
they don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left iraq, i said we should've taken
so now isis has the oil, and what they don't have, iran has
and in 19  and i will tell you this, and i said it very strongly, years ago, i said  and i love the military, and i want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever
but i said, don't hit iraq, because you're going to totally destabilize the middle east
iran is going to take over the middle east, iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that iran is now taking over iraq
think of it
iran is taking over iraq, and they're taking it over big league
we spent $2 trillion in iraq, $2 trillion
we lost thousands of lives, thousands in iraq
we have wounded soldiers, who i love, i love  they're great  all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers
and we have nothing
we can't even go there
we have nothing
and every time we give iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it
last week, i read 2,300 humvees  these are big vehicles  were left behind for the enemy
2,000
you would say maybe two, maybe four
2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them
last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product  a sign of strength, right
but not for us
it was below zero
whoever heard of this
it's never below zero
our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978
but think of it, gdp below zero, horrible labor participation rate
and our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent
don't believe the 5
don't believe it
that's right
a lot of people up there can't get jobs
they can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because china has our jobs and mexico has our jobs
they all have jobs
but the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense
our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker
even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work
it came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old
they don't know if it worked
and i thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, that is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue
they don't know what they're doing
they don't know what they're doing
we have a disaster called the big lie
obamacare
obamacare
yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof
you have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless
it's virtually useless
it is a disaster
trump
and remember the $5 billion web site
$5 billion we spent on a web site, and to this day it doesn't work
a $5 billion web site
if and when the vatican is attacked by isis, which as everyone knows is isis's ultimate trophy, i can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened
isis would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians
the mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the pope, because they want to continue to rip off the united states, both on trade and at the border, and they understand i am totally wise to them
the pope only heard one side of the story - he didn't see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the united states
he doesn't see how mexican leadership is outsmarting president obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation
for a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful
i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current president
no leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith
they are using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant
i have so many web sites, i have them all over the place
i hire people, they do a web site
it costs me $3
$5 billion web site
well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action
nothing's gonna get done
they will not bring us  believe me  to the promised land
they will not
as an example, i've been on the circuit making speeches, and i hear my fellow republicans
and they're wonderful people
i like them
they all want me to support them
they don't know how to bring it about
they come up to my office
i'm meeting with three of them in the next week
and they don't know  are you running
are you not running
could we have your support
what do we do
how do we do it
i like them
and i hear their speeches
and they don't talk jobs and they don't talk china
when was the last time you heard china is killing us
they're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe
it makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible
they're killing us
but you don't hear that from anybody else
you don't hear it from anybody else
and i watch the speeches
thank you
i watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen
and people are saying, what's going on
i just want a job
just get me a job
i don't need the rhetoric
i want a job
and that's what's happening
and it's going to get worse, because remember, obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016
obama is going to be out playing golf
he might be on one of my courses
i would invite him, i actually would say
i have the best courses in the world, so i'd say, you what, if he wants to  i have one right next to the white house, right on the potomac
if he'd like to play, that's fine
in fact, i'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing
but obamacare kicks in in 2016
really big league
it is going to be amazingly destructive
doctors are quitting
i have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, donald, i never saw anything like it
i have more accountants than i have nurses
it's a disaster
my patients are beside themselves
they had a plan that was good
they have no plan now
we have to repeal obamacare, and it can be  and  and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody
let it be for everybody
but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government
and we can do it
so i've watched the politicians
i've dealt with them all my life
if you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you
you're certainly not very good
and that's what we have= representing us
they will never make america great again
they don't even have a chance
they're controlled fully  they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully
yes, they control them
hey, i have lobbyists
i have to tell you
i have lobbyists that can produce anything for me
they're great
but you know what
it won't happen
it won't happen
because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country
we have to stop, and it has to stop now
we need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets
our vets have been abandoned
and we also need a cheerleader
you know, when president obama was elected, i said, well, the one thing, i think he'll do well
i think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country
i think he'd be a great spirit
he was vibrant
he was young
i really thought that he would be a great cheerleader
he's not a leader
that's true
you're right about that
but he wasn't a cheerleader
he's actually a negative force
he's been a negative force
he wasn't a cheerleader
he was the opposite
we need somebody that can take the brand of the united states and make it great again
it's not great again
we need  we need somebody  we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again
we can do that
and, i will tell you, i love my life
i have a wonderful family
they're saying, dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough
you know, all of my life, i've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office
just can't happen
and yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again
so ladies and gentlemen
i am officially running
for president of the united states, and we are going to make our country great again
it can happen
our country has tremendous potential
we have tremendous people
we have people that aren't working
we have people that have no incentive to work
but they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job
and they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be  they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving
it can happen
i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created
i tell you that
i'll bring back our jobs from china, from mexico, from japan, from so many places
i'll bring back our jobs, and i'll bring back our money
right now, think of this
we owe china $1
3 trillion
we owe japan more than that
so they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better
how stupid are our leaders
how stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen
how stupid are they
i'm going to tell you  thank you
i'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because i'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons
number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue
our president doesn't have a clue
he's a bad negotiator
he's the one that did bergdahl
we get bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there
we get bergdahl
we get a traitor
we get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us
that's the negotiator we have
take a look at the deal he's making with iran
he makes that deal, israel maybe won't exist very long
it's a disaster, and we have to protect israel
but
so we need people  i'm a free trader
but the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you
if you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible
free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid
we have people that aren't smart
and we have people that are controlled by special interests
and it's just not going to work
so, here's a couple of stories happened recently
a friend of mine is a great manufacturer
and, you know, china comes over and they dump all their stuff, and i buy it
i buy it, because, frankly, i have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again
but with all our problems with russia, with all our problems with everything  everything, they got away with it again
and it's impossible for our people here to compete
so i want to tell you this story
a friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago
he's very upset
i said, what's your problem
he said, you know, i make great product
and i said, i know
i know that because i buy the product
he said, i can't get it into china
they won't accept it
i sent a boat over and they actually sent it back
they talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it
i said, oh, wait a minute, that's terrible
does anyone know this
he said, yeah, they do it all the time with other people
i said, they send it back
yeah
so i finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff
they're not supposed to be doing that
i told them
now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there
ask boeing
they wanted boeing's secrets
they wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from boeing
hey, i'm not saying they're stupid
i like china
i sell apartments for  i just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from china
am i supposed to dislike them
i own a big chunk of the bank of america building at 1290 avenue of the americas, that i got from china in a war
very valuable
i love china
the biggest bank in the world is from china
you know where their united states headquarters is located
in this building, in trump tower
i love china
people say, oh, you don't like china
no, i love them
but their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that
there's too much  it's like  it's like take the new england patriots and tom brady and have them play your high school football team
that's the difference between china's leaders and our leaders
they are ripping us
we are rebuilding china
we're rebuilding many countries
china, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it
they have bridges that make the george washington bridge look like small potatoes
and they're all over the place
we have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them
we don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game
we could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly
now they're going militarily
they're building a military island in the middle of the south china sea
a military island
now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country  we would never build in an ocean
they built it in about one year, this massive military port
they're building up their military to a point that is very scary
you have a problem with isis
you have a bigger problem with china
and, in my opinion, the new china, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is mexico
so this man tells me about the manufacturing
i say, that's a terrible story
i hate to hear it
but i have another one, ford
so mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in tennessee, rips it out
everybody thought the deal was dead
reported it in the wall street journal recently
everybody thought it was a done deal
it's going in and that's going to be it, going into tennessee
great state, great people
trump
all of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to tennessee
they're gonna spend their $1 billion in mexico instead
not good
now, ford announces a few weeks ago that ford is going to build a $2
5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in mexico
5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world
ford
good company
so i announced that i'm running for president
i would
one of the early things i would do, probably before i even got in  and i wouldn't even use  you know, i have  i know the smartest negotiators in the world
i know the good ones
i know the bad ones
i know the overrated ones
you get a lot of them that are overrated
they're not good
they think they are
they get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph)
but they're not good
but i know the negotiators in the world, and i put them one for each country
believe me, folks
we will do very, very well, very, very well
but i wouldn't even waste my time with this one
i would call up the head of ford, who i know
if i was president, i'd say, congratulations
i understand that you're building a nice $2
5 billion car factory in mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the united states zero tax, just flow them across the border
and you say to yourself, how does that help us, right
how does that help us
where is that good
it's not
so i would say, congratulations
that's the good news
let me give you the bad news
every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it
now, here's what is going to happen
if it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible)
and here's what's going to happen
they're not so stupid
they know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it
but then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for ford and say, you can't do that to ford, because ford takes care of me and i take care of you, and you can't do that to ford
and guess what
no problem
they're going to build in mexico
they're going to take away thousands of jobs
it's very bad for us
so under president trump, here's what would happen
the head of ford will call me back, i would say within an hour after i told them the bad news
but it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day
you know, they want to be a little cool
and he'll say, please, please, please
he'll beg for a little while, and i'll say, no interest
then he'll call all sorts of political people, and i'll say, sorry, fellas
no interest, because i don't need anybody's money
it's nice
i don't need anybody's money
i'm using my own money
i'm not using the lobbyists
i'm not using donors
i don't care
i'm really rich
i (inaudible)
and by the way, i'm not even saying that in a  that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country
so  because we got to make the country rich
it sounds crass
somebody said, oh, that's crass
it's not crass
we got $18 trillion in debt
we got nothing but problems
we got a military that needs equipment all over the place
we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete
we've got nothing
we've got social security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country
all these other people want to cut the hell out of it
i'm not going to cut it at all
i'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it
but here's what's going to happen
after i'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after i'm called by all of the special interests and by the  the donors and by the lobbyists  and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero  i'll get a call the next day from the head of ford
he'll say
please reconsider, i'll say no
he'll say, mr
president, we've decided to move the plant back to the united states, and we're not going to build it in mexico
that's it
they have no choice
they have no choice
there are hundreds of things like that
i'll give you another example
trump
saudi arabia, they make $1 billion a day
$1 billion a day
i love the saudis
many are in this building
they make a billion dollars a day
whenever they have problems, we send over the ships
we say we're gonna protect
what are we doing
they've got nothing but money
if the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune
they wouldn't be there except for us
and believe me, you look at the border with yemen
you remember obama a year ago, yemen was a great victory
two weeks later, the place was blown up
everybody got out  and they kept our equipment
they always keep our equipment
we ought to send used equipment, right
they always keep our equipment
we ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be  we ought to send our surplus
we're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff
but look at that border with saudi arabia
do you really think that these people are interested in yemen
saudi arabia without us is gone
they
re gone
and i'm the one that made all of the right predictions about iraq
you know, all of these politicians that i'm running against now  it's so nice to say i'm running as opposed to if i run, if i run
i'm running
but all of these politicians that i'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate
i mean, you looked at bush, it took him five days to answer the question on iraq
he couldn't answer the question
he didn't know
i said, is he intelligent
then i looked at rubio
he was unable to answer the question, is iraq a good thing or bad thing
he didn't know
he couldn't answer the question
how are these people gonna lead us
how are we gonna  how are we gonna go back and make it great again
we can't
they don't have a clue
they can't lead us
they can't
they can't even answer simple questions
it was terrible
but saudi arabia is in big, big trouble
now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place
and i used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders
they were smarter than our leaders
there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again
because we need money
we're dying
we're dying
we need money
we have to do it
and we need the right people
so ford will come back
they'll all come back
and i will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence
so the reporter said to me the other day, but, mr
trump, you're not a nice person
how can you get people to vote for you
i said, i don't know
i said, i think that number one, i am a nice person
i give a lot of money away to charities and other things
i think i'm actually a very nice person
but, i said, this is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people
and they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world
and they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education
and some of them are like third world countries
but we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything
so one of the things i did, and i said, you know what i'll do
i'll do it
because a lot of people said, he'll never run
number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle
they're right about that, but i'm doing it
number two, i'm a private company, so nobody knows what i'm worth
and the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth
so i said, that's ok
i'm proud of my net worth
i've done an amazing job
i started off  thank you  i started off in a small office with my father in brooklyn and queens, and my father said  and i love my father
i learned so much
he was a great negotiator
i learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors
but i learned a lot
but he used to say, donald, don't go into manhattan
that's the big leagues
we don't know anything about that
don't do it
i said, i gotta go into manhattan
i gotta build those big buildings
i gotta do it, dad
i've gotta do it
and after four or five years in brooklyn, i ventured into manhattan and did a lot of great deals  the grand hyatt hotel
i was responsible for the convention center on the west side
i did a lot of great deals, and i did them early and young
and now i'm building all over the world, and i love what i'm doing
but they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, well, donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks
so i said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless i run, because i'm really proud of my success
i really am
i've employed  i've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime
that means medical
that means education
that means everything
so a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary
but everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything
we'll be filing it right on time
we don't need anything
and it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, he had assets of $9 billion
so i said (ph), no, that's the wrong number
that's the wrong number
not assets
so they put together this
and before i say it, i have to say this
i made it the old-fashioned way
it's real estate
you know, it's real estate
it's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world
and i have assets  big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected  9 billion 240 million dollars
and i have liabilities of about $500 million (ph)
that's long-term debt, very low interest rates
in fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, donald, you don't have enough borrowings
could we loan you $4 billion
i said, i don't need it
i don't want it
and i've been there
i don't want it
but in two seconds, they give me whatever i wanted
so i have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion
but here, a total net worth of  net worth, not assets, not  a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets  trump tower, 1290 avenue of the americas, bank of america building in san francisco, 40 wall street, sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new york  many other places all over the world
so the total is $8,737,540,00
now i'm not doing that
i'm not doing that to brag, because you know what
i don't have to brag
i don't have to, believe it or not
i'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs
we need that thinking
we have the opposite thinking
we have losers
we have losers
we have people that don't have it
we have people that are morally corrupt
we have people that are selling this country down the drain
so i put together this statement, and the only reason i'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years  you know, we're at $8 trillion now
we're soon going to be at $20 trillion
trump
according to the economists  who i'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying  that $24 trillion  we're very close  that's the point of no return
$24 trillion
we will be there soon
that's when we become greece
that's when we become a country that's unsalvageable
and we're gonna be there very soon
we're gonna be there very soon
i will immediately terminate president obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately
fully support and back up the second amendment
now, it's very interesting
today i heard it
through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are
and a woman was on television this morning, and she said, you know, mr
trump, and she was telling other people, and i actually called her, and she said, you know, mr
trump, i always was against guns
i didn't want guns
and now since this happened  it's up in the prison area  my husband and i are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns
we now have a gun on every table
we're ready to start shooting
i said, very interesting
so protect the second amendment
end  end common core
common core should  it is a disaster
bush is totally in favor of common core
i don't see how he can possibly get the nomination
he's weak on immigration
he's in favor of common core
how the hell can you vote for this guy
you just can't do it
we have to end  education has to be local
rebuild the country's infrastructure
nobody can do that like me
believe me
it will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought
i look at the roads being built all over the country, and i say i can build those things for one-third
what they do is unbelievable, how bad
you know, we're building on pennsylvania avenue, the old post office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels
it's gonna be the best hotel in washington, d
we got it from the general services administration in washington
the obama administration
we got it
it was the most highly sought after  or one of them, but i think the most highly sought after project in the history of general services
we got it
people were shocked, trump got it
well, i got it for two reasons
number one, we're really good
number two, we had a really good plan
and i'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement
because the general services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job
and they wanted to make sure it got built
so we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports
you come into la guardia airport, it's like we're in a third world country
you look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor
they throw down asphalt, and they throw
you look at these airports, we are like a third world country
and i come in from china and i come in from qatar and i come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world
you come to back to this country and you have lax, disaster
you have all of these disastrous airports
we have to rebuild our infrastructure
save medicare, medicaid and social security without cuts
have to do it
get rid of the fraud
get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it
people have been paying it for years
and now many of these candidates want to cut it
you save it by making the united states, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost
renegotiate our foreign trade deals
reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble
we have artificially low interest rates
we have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but i still hate to see what's happening
we have a stock market that is so bloated
be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens
so be very, very careful
and strengthen our military and take care of our vets
so, so important
chris, thank you very much
i appreciate it
this has been an amazing evening
already, we've won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine
it's really been  it's really been great
i want to congratulation ted on the winning of texas
he worked hard on he  i know how hard he worked actually, and so i congratulate ted cruz on that win
that was an excellent win
we're going to make america great again, folks
we're going to make it great again
and, you know, i watched hillary's speech and she's talking about wages have been poor and everything's poor and everything's doing badly, but we're going to make it  she's been there for so long
i mean, if she hasn't straightened it out by now, she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years
it's just going to become worse and worse
she wants to make america whole again and i'm trying to figure out what is that all about
make america great again is going to be much better than making america whole again
so i just want to say that this was an exciting evening
it's so great to be in florida
it's so great to be at mar-a-lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody
i know it was a very tough night for marco rubio
he had a tough night but he worked hard
he spent a lot of money
he is a lightweight, as i've said many times before
but you know what
we're going to go to florida, we're going to spend so much time in florida
we've got about a 20-point lead
i know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they're going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires
and frankly, i think that's fine
as far as i'm concerned, it's fine
and if he wins, they'll have totally controlled  total control
but he's not going anywhere anyway, but we'll see what happens
but we're going to spend a lot of time in florida
the virginia one was just a great win because it's a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in florida
remember, we have thousands of employees in florida, all along miami, doral and mar-a-lago and so many other places
and it's been an amazing place to invest
it's been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on
and you know, i have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we'll just say all over the country
and it's been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly
recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation
i mean, our nation is in serious trouble
we're being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed
china is just taking advantage of us
i have nothing against china
i have great respect for china, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders
our leaders don't have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much
no country can sustain that kind of trade deficit
it won't be that way for long
we have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we're going to redo those trade deals and it's going to be a thing of beauty
you look at countries like mexico, where they're killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border
they're destroying us in terms of economic development
companies like carrier air conditioner just moving into mexico
ford, moving into mexico
nabisco, closing up shop in chicago and moving into mexico
we have to stop it, folks
i know how to stop it
we're going to create jobs
we're going to create jobs like you've never seen
we're going to lower taxes
i have a plan that larry kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they've seen
we're going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class
the middle class has been forgotten in our country
it really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we're all so proud of, but we've forgotten the middle class
so we're going to lower taxes
we're lowering taxes on business
you look at all the companies that are moving out
when you see pfizer moving to ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they're leaving
they used to move from new york to florida, or they'd move from new jersey to someplace else, chris
but now they're moving from here    not that many people are leaving new jersey
but chris understands the problem, fully understands
now they're leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world
we can't let that happen
we've lost our manufacturing jobs
we've lost our manufacturing
millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses
i mean, we are losing so much
we can't let it happen
i tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders caterpillar
and recently, he ordered komatsu tractors from japan because they've cut the yen
they've devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for caterpillar to compete
and i don't want that to happen
that's not going to happen
they shouldn't be allowed to do it
we have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source
we have great, great power
the problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don't know what they're doing
so we're going to work very, very hard
i'm so honored by this evening
if you would've told me on june 16th, when i was with my wife, melania, and we came down the escalator in trump tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this
you have a lot of cameras here tonight
it looked, literally, like the academy awards
i never saw so many cameras in my life
and it takes courage to run
i'll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president
i've never done this before
i've been a job-producer
i've done a lot of things but this is something i've never done, but i felt we had to do it
when you look at the incompetence of the iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing
when you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted
we're going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody
so it's just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight
and if you want, press, i think we told you before we'd be okay if you want to ask a few questions
yes, go ahead
well, they can always do that and then they'll  then they'll just lose everything and that would be the  that would be the work of a loser
but let me just explain something
if you've seen what's happened, whether you go to south carolina, where i had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in new hampshire, tremendous in nevada, you look at what's happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all
i mean, right now, they're projected i guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states
it's georgia, alabama, massachusetts  (cheers)  tennessee, virginia
and you know, these are amazing states and we're going to probably get a lot more
in fact, we're projected to have some pretty good additional numbers
but i will say this
look, we have expanded the republican party
when you look at what's happened in south carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in
they came from the democratic party, or the democrat party, and they're democrats and they're long-time democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched
and they were independents
and we've actually expanded the party
look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example
four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes
we doubled it
we were almost 800,000
whereas the democrats went down
there's much less enthusiasm for the democrats
so i  look, i'm a unifier
i know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, i am a unifier
once we get all of this finished, i'm going to go after one person, that's hillary clinton, on the assumption she's allowed to run, which is a big assumption
i don't know that she's going to be allowed to run
and i think that's, frankly, going to be an easy race
you see the polls
i beat hillary in many polls
i know one thing
i don't think marco is going to be able to beat her
i don't think  in all fairness, i think ted's going to have a very hard time
but ted at least has a shot because at least he's won a little bit
so i just tell you this
we are going to be a much finer party, a much  we're going to be a unified party, i mean, to be honest with you
and we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening
we're going to be a much bigger party
our party is expanding
and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where i've won and just look  we've gone from x number to a much larger number
that hasn't happened to the republican party in many, many decades
so i think we're going to be more inclusive
i think we're going to be more unified and i think we're going to be a much bigger party, and i think we're going to win in november
ok, yeah
i'm just doing what's right
look, planned parenthood has done very good work for some  for many, many  for millions of women
and i'll say it and i know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that's really  because i'm a conservative, but i'm a common-sense conservative
but millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood
but we're not going to allow and we're not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at planned parenthood, and we understand that and i've said it loud and clear
but  and we'll see what happens
but planned parenthood  millions of people  and i've had thousands of letters from women that have been helped
and this wasn't a setup
this was people writing letters
i'm going to be really good for women
i'm going to be good for women's health issues
it's very important to me, very important to me
and maybe that's not a perfect conservative view, but i can tell you one thing
i'm more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you're going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education
so sarah, i mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but i am a truth-teller and i will tell the truth, ok
yeah, go ahead, finish it
i feel awfully good
i mean, i'm watching your people  i'm watching your people on  and i'm going to be very nice, i'm going to be very nice  i'm watching your people on cnn and i'm watching the fox people and i'm watching the msnbc people, too, ok
see
i'm becoming diplomatic
and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight
i mean, you know, they're being very strong
and they are, they're declaring marco rubio the big loser of the night, which is true
he didn't win anything
he hasn't won anything, period
and by the way, and i have to tell you  and he was very, very nasty
i've never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he's got a right to be nasty
he hasn't won anything and he's not going to win very much
but i do congratulate ted because i know how hard ted worked on texas and it's a big get
now i also did very well in texas
i came in second
and one of the things my son, eric, told me, which i didn't even realize, is that not only did i win most of the states  and some are coming in and i'm expected to win them  but i came in second  i came in no worse than second
so it wasn't like i won and then i disappeared
the worst i had was a second
so i'm very, very honored by the turnout, ok
yes, go ahead
right
oh, they're totally wrong
look, i disavowed
i disavowed when i  in fact, chris is my number one  chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign
he called me
he said, donald, what you've got is a movement
we spoke today in kentucky
you've never seen a crowd like that
that had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible
and every place we're speaking, if we have 10,000 people it's like a small group
we had 35,000 people the other day in alabama
and when chris called, he said this is a movement
this is something like i've never seen
and in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing
they've never seen what's happening right now
they've never seen anything like it
and i'm just honored by it
now, when chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question
i said i disavow
now, right after the program that we're talking about  and i thought it was clear, but you know, we're talking about groups, groups, groups
i do have to know the name of the group because, who knows
i mean, they have to give me the name of the group
but right after, when i reviewed it, i put out a tweet and i put out on facebook that i totally disavow
now everybody knew i did that but the press refused to look at that
it was right after
and i disavowed then
i disavowed today on abc with george stephanopoulos, i disavowed again
i mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow
but i disavow and hopefully it's the final time i have to do it
but if you look at facebook and if you look at twitter, right after the show i put out a statement because i want everybody to be sure
yes, go ahead
no, it's not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it's going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation
it's going to be a negotiation where we'll start at certain levels and hopefully i will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the american people
so you know, look, you can't go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he's done executive order, executive order
it's almost like, i don't even know
does he ever go a deal with congress anymore
does he ever speak to the senate
does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done
you know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that i  is very, very important to me
corporate inversion
carl icahn, who's a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he  it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we're losing companies
and we're losing for two reasons
we're losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high
we have the highest  we're the highest taxed nation in the world
and very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country
the democrats agree it should be brought back in
the republicans agree it should be brought back in
everybody agrees it should be brought back in
i could sit in a room  or the oval office  for a period of, literally, a half hour and i really believe i could get everybody  every single  you know, it's one thing they don't agree on health care or they don't agree on common core or they don't agree on other things and they'll fight
here's something every single  i mean, almost everybody agrees
these trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country
the president can't make a deal
the reason is he doesn't know how to make a deal, probably doesn't work at it, probably doesn't care, but you're talking about tremendous number of  tremendous amounts of money
so when you have something that everybody wants and you can't make a deal, there's something going on that's really wrong
and what it means is you have the wrong leader
yes
well, look, everything  we are going to have a wall
i can tell you we are going to have a wall
i watched the ex-president of mexico, the arrogance of this man
and i get along great with hispanics
you saw in nevada, i won in the poll, the hispanic vote
i have thousands of people that work for me right now that are hispanic
i've had thousands and thousands over my lifetime
these are great people
the mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it
vincente fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have  if i ever used that word you folks would've never, ever, ever let me get away with it
nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word
but he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall
mexico is going to pay for the wall
we have a trade deficit with mexico of $58 billion a year  $58 billion
the wall is going to cost $10 billion
it's so easy
i've had these guys that i'm on the stage with go you don't really mean mexico is going to pay for the wall
one  as sure as you're standing there, 100 percent, mexico's going to pay, 100 percent
and the reason is i'm a businessman
i know how to do this
politicians are all talk, no action
it's not going to  except for chris christie, of course
it's not  look, it's not going to happen
it's not going to happen with these people
so when you think of it  and then they say you'll never be able to build a wall
well, it's 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles
the great wall of china, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn't have caterpillar tractors, because i only want to use caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or john deere
i buy a lot of equipment from john deere
i love john deere, too
but they didn't have tractors
they didn't have cranes
they didn't have excavation equipment
the wall is 13,000 miles long
we need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials
we can do that so beautifully
and this is going to be a serious wall
this is going to be high wall
this is going to be a very serious wall
we're going to stop drugs from coming into new hampshire
you know, when i won new hampshire, those people were so incredible to me
and when you go, you wouldn't believe it because it's so bucolic, so beautiful
you look at the fields and you look at everything, it's so beautiful
and yet, you go to a meeting in new hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine
the heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted
and i told them i'm going to stop it
i'm going to stop it
we're going to have a strong border, and i mean strong
and by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they're going to come into this country, but they're going to come in legally, ok
i've got to find out what's going on
we've got a big problem
we have a big, big problem
i'll tell it like it is
we have a big, big problem
we've got to figure it out
we're going to figure it out
radical islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us
you take a look at germany, you take a look at sweden, you take a look at brussels
you look at some of these places, it's like a disaster
and we're not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they're young and they're strong
you look at that migration line
they're young, they're strong, they're powerful
and you say why aren't they back fighting for their country
now, with all of that being said, i feel strongly  i have a bigger heart than anybody
we're going to build a safe zone
it's going to be in syria
and i'm going to get the gulf states, who have more money than anybody  we've got to loosen up their wallets a little bit
we're going to get  but they're not accepting people
we're going to get  wait, wait, wait
we're going to get the gulf states to pay for it because they should
oh, we're going to bring them back
we're going to bring them back
look, i'm telling you  you know how i'm going to bring them back
first of all, we're going to do great with the african- americans, and you see that in the polls where i had in one poll where i'm 25 percent
and one of the commentators, who i think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if donald trump gets 25 percent of the african-american vote, this election is over
you watch
and the reason i'm getting that  and i'm going to do great with the hispanics
i'm going to do great with virtually every group
the reason is i'm going to bring jobs back
i'm going to get apple to start making their computers and their iphones on our land, not in china
how does it help us when they make it in china
well, look, i always liked marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile
he decided to become don rickles, ok
but don rickles has a lot more talent
honestly, i did, i always liked him but he became  you know, somebody told him you're losing very badly
the only way you can possibly win, take the hail mary, they called it a hail mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile
it's hurt him
in fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent
it's really hurt him
but look, i'm not going to tell him what to do
i'm not going to tell anybody what to do
you have to run
he had a bad night, according to cnn, fox
i watched their broadcasts
they say the loser of the night was marco rubio and it's true
he didn't win anything
he hasn't won
i mean, at least you can say that ted has won something, and you know, marco has not won
you've got to be able to win
you can't talk
you know, these politicians, all talk, no action
you've got to be able to win something
he hasn't won anything
and he actually hasn't come very close
so we'll see what happens
yes, go ahead
i'm going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that's in big trouble
our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports
i go throughout the world
i mean, you go to qatar, you go to  some people say qatar, but you go to qatar, you go to any of  so many places
you go to different places in china, different places in asia, different places in the middle east, you look at some of the airports they have
you look at the roadways they have
you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have
we're like a third world country
so i am going to be very good for the world
i'm going to get along with the world
you're going to be very proud of me
even you will be very proud of me as a president
but we have to rebuild our country
our country is going to hell and people don't understand that
and hillary clinton doesn't have a clue
she can't do that
she's talking about  i mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, i think one of the reasons i have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today  less money than they made 12 years ago
and in her speech, she just said they're making less money
well, she's been there with obama for a long period of time
why hasn't she done anything about it
practically everything that she was complaining about  she's picked up what i say
the difference is she's been there for a long period of time
why haven't they done anything about it
then you look at her record as secretary of state
it's abysmal
you look at what's going on with syria
you look at what's going on with everything
it's a disaster
so we're going to have an interesting period of time
i don't know that she's going to be allowed to run
what she did is a criminal act
if she's allowed to run i would be very, very surprised
but if she's allowed to run, honestly, it'll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong
and what she did  (cheers)  let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price
ok, one or two more questions
yeah, go ahead, jeremy
at this moment, absolutely not, no
we either have a country or we don't
we have a country, or we don't
we have borders or we don't have borders
and at this moment, the answer is absolutely not
well, look, i don't expect  i have a lot of respect for reince and for the group and i like the rnc and i don't know that i've been treated fairly or not
i really don't know
i can't tell you that
but i can tell you that i do respect them
what i really have is a great number of people
i have millions and millions of people
and when i was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before i came in here because i wanted to see exactly where we were before i started speaking, i was amazed at the kind of numbers
the republicans have tremendous energy
the democrats don't
they don't have any energy
their numbers are down
our number are through the roof
and people are making the statements they've never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized
i think if somebody is doing as well as i'm doing  and i'm not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else  but if i'm going to win five  i've already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine
it could be nine, could win nine states tonight
if i'm going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if i'm going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that i might not win, i think, you know, we're a democracy
i think it's awfully hard to say that's not the person we want to lead the party, right
you know, it's very hard
but i really think that  i think it's a great question, david, because i really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the republican party has become more dynamic
it's become more diverse
we're taking from the democrats
we're taking from the independents
we have a lot more people
we have a lot more people
i mean, take a look at south carolina
look at the numbers
look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote
and then you look at  i was there and you had lines that went a mile long
and it was virtually more than doubled
so we have a very, very dynamic party and i think we're going to be able to unify the party
i hope to be able to get along with everybody
i don't know paul ryan well but i hope to be able to get along with him
i do know mitch mcconnell a little bit but i hope to be able to get along with him
but remember this
i have millions and millions and millions of people
this isn't like it's a close match
i mean, it's only too bad that winner didn't take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over
we're just having a celebration
you know, we're having a celebration
so anyway, i would like to  look, i just want to end by thanking everybody
this has been an amazing period in my life
my wife just called and ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she's a special person and it's going to be great and we look forward to that
she's back in new york
she wanted to be here
they all wanted to be here but they're with ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week
but this this has been an amazing period of time
it's been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint
and i think, honestly, we've done something that almost nobody thought could be done and i'm very proud of it
and i just want to leave you with this
i am a unifier
i would love to see the republican party and everybody get together and unify
and when we unify, there's nobody, nobody that's going to beat us
thank you very much everybody
thank you
thank you very much
thank you
this is so  so incredible
we  we have had, no matter where we go  you know, it's a movement, folks
this is a movement
no matter where we go, it's amazing
we go to dallas
we go to oklahoma
we go all over
we went to, the other night, iowa  packed
every place  new hampshire, packed
every place we go to, it's like this
it's amazing
and just great, great people
and they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, go home
we'll come back
we'll do another one
but they had to go home
would you like to leave and we'll let them come in
i don't think so, but we  they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually
so maybe next time
i don't know
i think this is the largest room
i know it's a record for the room
you know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they're standing
they're not sitting
so that's great
i love  we love setting records
we want the country to set records, right
so, you know, i  i do this, and i love to do it
and i talk about our success because that's ultimately what it's all about
i think we're going to do fantastically well in iowa
i really think we're going to do great there
and i could say, oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five
i'm not  i'm looking to win everything
we want to run the table
we want to run it, because that sends a signal
and, you know, we've been a little bit  we had to respond to hillary
she came out with that  she came out  remember, she wrote  she said, he's got a  he's demonstrated a penchant  i demonstrated  a penchant for sexism
can you believe it
nobody respects women more than donald trump
that i can tell you
and, you know, when she said that, i had no choice, because i didn't start it
i had no choice
and i did have to mention her husband's situation
(laughter)
and that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10
so, we have to do it
you can't let people push you around
you can't let people tell lies
you can't do it
you know, it's interesting
one of the polls came out from cnbc and they said that if it's trump against hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country
i can see that
i can see it
and they said all of these people that are going to come in new, that never vote  they never vote, they don't care  they're going to mostly  i'll tell you what, they're going to vote for trump
that's why they're coming in, because they're so fed up with the system  this corrupt, horrible system
they're fed up with it and they're fed up with those guys back there, the media
trump
they are the worst
no, no, no
they're fed up
they're fed up with the media
i mean, i've got  and you know, not all bad, but there's so much dishonesty in the media
and i like to call it out
and one of the things that's really been amazing to me, and such  it's been so beautiful to watch  the level of genius in the public
they get it, you know
they really get it
they want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, oh, gee
the level of genius  they fully understand
they know they're crooked, they know they're dishonest and they really  otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me
(laughter)
and yet, i see a poll at 42 percent
and you know, you're talking about 15, 16 people, started with 17
how are you
started with 17 people
and you know, i'd be happy with 42 if we had three, ok
not thrilled, i'd like to be that  over that 50 mark, but i think we're doing really well
and you know, it's interesting, but the debates  ok
so the debates  thank  i love you too, darling
(laughter)
i love you
i do
i love you
i love every  you know what
the rooms, no matter where, whether it's stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, it's amazing, and there's love in the room
and i told  the other night, i said and a friend of mine, very, very successful guy who i would love to have negotiating against china
that's what we need, not these hacks that we have
no, no
i have guys
carl icahn endorsed me
great business man
we have  i have great, great business people that want to be involved
and we're going to use  we have the best
we have the best in the world
we don't use them
we use political hacks, we use special interest people that really don't care about the country, they care about their deals
this is going to change so fast
you know, last year, $500 billion trade deficit with china
think about it
you know what $500 billion is
you do  you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit  trade deficit with china
what are we
are we  yes, i guess the answer is certainly let's not blame us
our leaders are stupid and  and/or  you have to say and/or they have deals, because what's happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do  our leaders, can you believe our leaders
this is what  but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don't even want to do because they've given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars
i look at this guy jeb bush
he spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave
he is nowhere
no, no
think of it
it's got to be much more than that
it was actually $59 million a while ago
every time i turn on an add, i see an ad about trump
i mean, it's not that bad an ad either
it's like  you know
if you're going to do an ad, do an ad
but he's a low-energy person
let's face it
we don't need low-energy
we need lots of energy
but he spent  think of it
think of it
he spent $59 million
i spent nothing, right
nothing
now, i'm going to be spending
you probably saw i'm going to spend  now, we're going to start spending a lot of money because i don't want to take any chances
you know, it's  i love getting up  and for the last couple of months, i have been leading from practically the time i announced, right
and for the last  and leading a lot
i'm going to go over that because i go over (ph) polls
i love polls
i love polls
now, when they  if they turn negative, i don't like them
and i promise, if they turn negative, i'm not going to be talking about them
in fact, i get criticized all the time
you're always talking about your polls
one of these guys just got two
he's at two
i'm at 42
and one of these guys who's at two said, he always talks about his polls and i don't
i wouldn't either if i had two, i swear i wouldn't
i wouldn't
i wouldn't do it at all
but you know, i love to tell the story where i have spent nothing and bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that
that's just  you know, because i see since then  i mean, just  you can't turn on this television without these commercials
and fox  every two minutes it's a commercial on trump
you know what he did
it's false advertising
so i killed him in the debate
according to reuters, according to everybody, drudge, who's an amazing guy, by the way
if you don't know drudge  matt drudge
right
he's a great guy
but drudge, 46 percent
at 46 percent, you have 15 people
now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out
a couple or more
but 15, 16 people  46 percent
time magazine, 49 percent
think of it
slate, 51 percent
news and world report  69 percent said i won the debate
i wont the debate, right
pbs, public broadcasting system  69 percent said trump won
no, you know, it is amazing
we have washington times at 62 percent
cbs, 59 percent
fox, 62 percent  fox las vegas, 62 percent
so, they all say  then they go back home, after the debate
i like to see how did i do
did i look good
looking good is very important, right
sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, it's how did you look
oh, i looked good, didn't sound too good, but that is ok
you wonder if that is a good trait
but i go home, and i watch, and the pundits will say  and they can't totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know what's happening  well, mr
trump was ok tonight
he was  i won every single online poll, i won
and then, here's bush
so, bush does an ad
and he takes me  and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage  and then i killed him
i mean, he  by the way, i met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got
he came in last
he takes the ad  and i shouldn't even talk about him
he's down to two or three  i  but it bothers me when i see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right
i say, why is he doing this
doesn't he have something better, he should go home
just relax
you know, honestly, he should go home and relax
he shouldn't be wasting his time
but it does
i say, why is this guy spending all this money
now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere  but here is my ad
so, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great
he took on trump, he took on trump
i'm standing here, he's over here
took on trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster
you know
so, he would remember (ph) it
he said, mr
trump, why don't you this
i said, ok
then i gave him an answer
i said, jeb, i'm at 42, you are at 2
right
it is a simple answer
you started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage
right
no, no, it's true
and then  and then  and that was it
and so i responded
so, he asked me a question, question was fine
you know, professionally written
so, he asked me a question, good
i give him an answer, i blow him away
right
everyone says trump won the debate
everybody
and hat is it
so, the ad is him asking the question and i'm standing there like this, because i haven't  in fact, you see in one of them, i'm just about ready to open my mouth
but he doesn't let me respond
that is almost false advertising, isn't it
you know
so, i mentioned it, hillary is a disaster
i mean, hillary
hillary is controlled by her money
so is jeb
so is  by the way, i'm the only one self-funding my campaign
i'm self-funding
you know, one of the things that makes me happy
i heard one of my commentators this morning, said, you know, i've been watching this stuff for 50 years and i've never seen anything like what has happened with trump
one of them actually said  one of them  i'm special
you're special
i like you
i'm special
isn't that nice
that's a very  every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you
where are you
who said that
wow
so nice
thank you
that is a nice one
that's like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal
i think low-energy was a brutal statement, right
low-energy can be applied to hillary
i just don't like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies
right
because i consider them enemies
we view this as war
don't we view this as war
it's war
it's war
and so, you don't like to use it
i hate to give it up
what
how are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter
oh, we are going to help your daughter
we are going to help the country, that's called helping the daughter
we are going to help your country
so, here is the story
so, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared
general odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember
and i think he went back tot he beginning, but let's say second world war
that's enough
and we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us
she has done a terrible job as secretary of state
think of it
putin comes out, he said, donald trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack
ok, that's nice
and she and my opponents  oh, isn't it terrible that putin said  wouldn't it be nice if we could get along with the world
wouldn't it be
seriously
no, no, wouldn't it be nice
i mean, they want me to refute his statement
how dare you say i'm brilliant
how dare  that's  who's going to do that
and by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy
but the point is, we have to get along
the world has blown up around barack obama
now, i don't know if you saw his recent release
they were talking about the department of state, state department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they've done
well, they couldn't find it because what have they done that's good
and they said bringing peace to syria
did you see that
so instead of saying they made a mistake  call it a typo, they made a mistake  they're trying to justify it
well, we meant we're working on it
can you believe  bringing peace to syria
the world is blowing up, the migration in syria  they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to syria, and the whole world's talking about it
it's  the level of stupidity is incredible
i'm telling you
i used to use the word incompetent, now i just call them stupid
i went to an ivy league school, i'm very highly educated
i know words, i had the best words
i have  but there's no better word than stupid
right
there is none
there is none
there's no  there's no  there's no word like that
so we are going to turn things around
but  and if we have hillary  i've got to tell you
i just saw where for the last week she's been hitting me really hard with the women card, ok
really hard
and i had to say ok, that's enough, that's enough
and we did a strong number
she's not going to win
any by the way, i love the concept  i love, love, love having a woman president
can't be her
she's horrible
she's horrible
and you know really don't  i'll tell you who does not like  yeah, we'll get ivanka
good
let's do ivanka
but i'll tell you who doesn't like hillary are women
women don't like hillary
i see it all the time
and always so theatrical
trump said this and that and this
and you just  i actually  i shouldn't do it
i just have to turn off the television so many times
she just gives me a headache
but you know  although i think last night i gave her a big headache
i can imagine  i can imagine those discussions
but you have to hit back hard, and you can't let them push you around
and today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name
you know, in the debate i was mentioned nine times, i mean everything
all of them
but her
i was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned
and then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense
and  but she's playing that card
and then i had to hit her back, so i hit her back and i talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse  no, it's tremendous abuse
i mean, you look at it, it's tremendous abuse
and i talked about that
and now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesn't even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else
i wonder why  i wonder why
and remember this
it's really important
a poll just came out where we're tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, fox, where i'm leading by four or five points against her individually
we're doing great
i haven't even focused on her yet
look at the people i've focused on
i don't want to really knock them, i don't want to mention their names
but, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me
wouldn't it be nice if our country could have that same thing
you attack and they're, boom, gone
and if we could do it verbally
you know, if we could do it verbally that's even better, right
you know, who wants to use our military
by the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever
ever
ever
and we're going to take care of our vets, we're going to take care of our vets
and it will cost you much less money, and it will be great
i mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, you know that
and you are paying for it
and you will never ever use them
so we will get that straightened out
we are going to straighten a lot of things
we are going to straighten out common core
common core is dead
it's going to be dead
when i look at parents and i see local parents in iowa and new hampshire and south carolina, i went to a school and i saw the parents, they love their children
they want that  they want education
they love  they don't care about money, they don't care about anything
they love their children and it's local
and they get together and they do wonderful programs
they are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big, fat checks in washington
i mean, we have such talent in this country and we don't use it
so, obamacare, dead
common core, gone
we are going to get rid of it
department of education, we are going to get rid of it
we are bringing education to a local level
one thing on education
so, in the world, we are ranked number 28
there are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things
and yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far  there is nobody close
number two isn't even close
so we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially
i mean, it's  can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1
and that's what i do like saying about my campaign, i spent less money than anybody else and i have the best results
i'm number one by a lot and i spent no money
i mean, my plane cost me some money, but i spent no ads
took a little radio ad in iowa
but i didn't do that  i took  i think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth
but i spent essentially no money
and then you have all these other guys spending vast  and they like the way the united states is run
now, why would we put a guy like jeb, like some of the others
it's not only jeb bush
they spend money
i see rubio on the ads all day long
you know, the black background
he's got like a black thing
he should have put something like that behind him, right
right there, the flag
no, no
and i like him
i think he is a nice guy
but i see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber
it's not  i don't think it's good
so, think of it
i spent no money and i'm number one
others spent  they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race
that's what we need for our country
what
i've got 15,000, i don't know what the hell he means by that but that's ok
so, but i think he's a fan
i don't think he's a  are you a protester
no body likes trump
he's not a protester
i love you
you know, the only time  don't worry about it
the only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester
cause i always have  like, look at this room, packed
i always have the biggest crowds
and i go home and my wife said were there many people
i watched you on television tonight
i said, i had 20,000 people
she said, they didn't show it
they have it right on your face
so i have 20,000 people
i have 20,000 in oklahoma, 35,000 in mobile, alabama
nobody knows
because those cameras stay right in your face and i think they can't move
you know, i think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe  except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, it's like
they don't even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots
and i like it because then it shows how big the crowds are
so, you know
some time i think i'm going to put in some false protesters
i'll put in some friendly protesters
it's the only way i'm going to be able to get the crowd in
so when we started, i talked about trade
i talked about the border
i talked about a lot of things
and i started on june 16th and  in trump tower, the famous escalator ride
and it takes guts to run for president
i'll tell you, you know, it's like, i've never did this before
and, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate
we have the largest audience in the history of cable television
then cnn a couple of weeks later had 23 million
fox had 24 million
cnn had 23 million  the largest audience in the history of cnn
now, they're there  the cameras are on live right now
i mean, you know
so, the largest audience in the history of (inaudible)
now, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted  they didn't want the debates
i think they were forced to take them for licensing
nobody wanted the debates
they drew nothing, but now they're drawing 24 million
now they want to have more debates  oh, can we have more
can we have more
can they go three hours
do you remember when they had the one go three hours
i said, no, i'm not doing three hours
it's too long
who wants  i could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right
trump, you have 30 seconds
what would you do about isis
oh, great
and by the way, that question  i hate those questions
you know why
because i want to be unpredictable
i don't want to tell isis what i'm going to do to knock the hell out of them
remember, i said very strongly  (inaudible) the oil for what, four years
you've been watching
i mean, four years
i've been get the oil, get the oil, get the oil
because who's going to get the oil
iran is taking over iraq
we made a deal for iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side
we gave them everything
they  we don't even get our prisoners back
and now iran wants to start negotiating separately for them
can you believe it
i go crazy
we would have gotten them back
all you had to do was say, we want our prisoners back
they would have said no
i would have said, i want them back
you don't understand me
i want them back
they would have said, no, we won't do that
i would have said, bye-bye, and i would have left
then i would have doubled up the sanctions
and i guarantee you
i guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and they'll say, you've got your prisoners
can we talk
and i would have never given them $150 billion
i would have never given them the money
i would have never give  they're using it  they don't have to make nuclear
they can buy it
why are they going to make it
then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections
how about the area  you know, the big area
they don't want us there
oh, i wonder why
they don't want us there
so they self-inspect, ok
then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty
we think you're making nuclear weapons here
well, let us go check, mr
president, we'll check
no, sir, we're not making nuclear weapons
nobody  no, we're not
we would never do a thing like that
these are people that have deceived us
they've lied to us
they're a terrorist state
but  and i used to say it's the worst deal that i've ever seen negotiated
and by the way, just to finish prisoners
so they'd come back
we get our prisoners
but then when i hear the other day that now this deal is done
it's all done
and now i hear they want to negotiate to get  and what do they say
they said very strongly, they said, we are going to want a lot for the prisoners
that's out  we're starting off
we're going to want a lot
now, we've already taken off the sanctions
they're already rich as hell
what  what's going on there
that's why i say, i mean, some people say it's worst than stupidity
there's something going on that we don't know about
i mean, honest
and you almost think  i'm not saying that, and i'm not a conspiracy person
as you said, we are
we're saying it
half the people in this room are saying it
i'm trying to be  you know, i'm just hoping they're just stupid people, ok
which they are
or there's something going on
because it's  it's inconceivable
you know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can't be  that nobody can do what they did, right
nobody
so, iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible)
in other words, that deal is done
now we want to start all over again
and they want a lot
we want a lot
and i just  i want to just shoot the television, you know
because they would have had it just by saying
and, you know, when they asked kerry and obama, the deal was made
everybody knows it's a horrible deal
it's going to need to  it's going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and they're so rich now
you know, they became  $150 billion  they became so rich
and many other things that you don't even know about
most people don't even know what the agreement says
but i'll tell you what, when you look at what we're doing, we're not going to have  if we keep going like this, folks, we're not going to have a country left
we're not going to have a country
we're not going to have a country
and we're like a dumping ground for the world
we're a dumping ground
they want to take these migrants  the migrants, you know, and i feel terrible about the migration, caused by hillary clinton and barack obama
they're the ones that caused it
they go into libya
they knocked the hell out of gadhafi
ok, so gadhafi  they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people
you know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom
and then gets killed by the same people
so, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than gadhafi
look at what we did in iraq
look at what we did in iraq
i mean, what the hell did we get
we spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago
i keep saying two or three, it's a lot more than that
we spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and i'm not even talking other side
you are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions
you have thousands of deaths
we have wounded warriors, who i love, all of
these guys are the toughest  these are the greatest people
you know, these are the greatest people
and then what happens
we leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving
so, i said, man, if i'm the enemy, i'm just going to go wait for 18 months right
he gave a date
we are leaving iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time
i said, i'm just sitting there watching and i'm saying, man, that's really stupid
because, believe me, the enemy doesn't want to be killed
you know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right
they don't
they want to live
and they want to take care of their families, always their families
you remember that, because their families know what's going on ok
you think their wives don't know what they are planning
you think their kids don't know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the world trade center
you think they don't know
they know exactly what's going on
remember that
and frankly, i think they have more love for their family's lives than they do for their own lives, ok
but they still want to live
so here is obama, gives an exact date
he gives an exact date and so they pull back
and everyone says, oh, we are doing so well
look, we're doing so well
why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place
so what happens
so we have isis taking a lot of oil
i said take the oil
remember when we left, i was opposed to going in because i said you're going to destabilize the middle east
because you had iraq and you had iran
and i said, they fight, they're always fighting for decades and decades, for generations
they fight, that's what they do
they fight
how we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe
they fight and they were equal militarily
they go this way, 10 feet
they go this way, 10 feet
then they rest a couple of years, then they start fighting again
then saddam hussein throws a little gas
everyone goes crazy
oh, it's because (ph) of gas
they go back and forth
it's the same
and they were stabilized
and i said, if you go after one or the other, in this case iraq, you're going to destabilize the middle east
that's what going to happen
you're going to destabilize the middle east
and that's exactly what happened
we totally destabilized the middle east
we have now migrations ,largely because of what's happened afterwards
you know iraq was horrible
it was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in
but we shouldn't have gotten out the way we went out
and we shouldn't have given dates
i mean, i would have probably said we are going to stay forever
and they would have said, oh, man
and then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy
i mean, he's never going to leave and you'll make a deal
but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back
and then as soon as we left, they come in ok
so they have the oil
you know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right
china
always china
i love china
i love mexico
their leaders are too smart for us
we have no border
we will build a wall
mexico will pay for the wall by the way
we're building a wall, we are going to have a border
and people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process
they're not coming in the way they're coming in now, just walking in like nothing
they are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process
so, with iraq, so we give them the date and they take over
we didn't take the year
so for four years, i have been talking about it
then because of paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil
but i didn't want to just bomb the oil
i wanted to take oil
they're bombing
you know, we are bombing
great
what's going to happen after that
so we're bombing
and, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it
i said, how could they keep selling it
obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere
no, this is serious
now think of it
he talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old air force one, an old boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff
so, he's got a problem with the carbon footprint
you can't use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone
i'm trying to figure out
let's see, i'm in my room in new york city and i want to put a little spray so that i can
right
right
but i hear where they don't want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which i really like better than going bing, bing, bing
and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you  it's stuck in your hair and you say oh my god, i've got to take a shower again
my hair's all screwed up, right
i want to use hair spray
they say don't use hair spray, it's bad for the ozone
so i'm sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit  you know, i really do live in a very nice apartment, right
but it's sealed, it's beautiful
i don't think anything gets out
and i'm not supposed to be using hair spray
but think of it
so obama's always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, ok
no, no, think of it
i mean, even if you're a believer in global warming, isis is a big problem, russia's a problem, china's a problem
we've got a lot of problems
by the way, the maniac in north korea is a problem
he actually has nuclear weapons, right
that's a problem
we've got a lot of problems
we've got a lot of problems
that's right, we don't win anymore
he said we want to win
we don't win anymore
we're going to win a lot  if i get elected, we're going to win a lot
we're going to win so much  we're going to win a lot
we're going to win a lot
we're going to win so much you're all going to get sick and tired of winning
you're going to say oh no, not again
i'm only kidding
you never get tired of winning, right
never
but think of it
so obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and the  a lot of it's a hoax, it's a hoax
i mean, it's a money-making industry, ok
it's a hoax, a lot of it
and look, i want clean air and i want clean water
that's my global  i want clean, clean crystal water and i want clean air
and we can do that, but we don't have to destroy our businesses, we don't have to destroy our
and by the way, china isn't abiding by anything
they're buying all of our coal
we can't use coal anymore essentially
they're buying our coal and they're using it
now when you talk about the planet, it's so big out there  we're here, they're there, it's like they're our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe
miss universe, by the way, i made a great deal when i sold  oh did i get rich
that was a great deal
you know, they broke my choppers on that
they said he talks about illegal immigration, we're not going to put him on television
first of all, univision is being sued like crazy
you wouldn't believe it
and nbc, i made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than i would have ever gotten  i mean, i made an unbelievable deal  far more than i ever would have gotten if i said i think i'm going to sell it if times were normal, right
isn't it amazing the way that stuff can work out
but i love miss universe and i love the universe
but think of it
so china is spewing up all this stuff and we're holding back
and with china  you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years
i don't think they're going to be doing it
it's like japan
if somebody attacks japan, we have to immediately go and start world war iii, ok
if we get attacked, japan doesn't have to help us
somehow, that doesn't sound so fair
does that sound good
so south korea  i order televisions, i order thousands of televisions a year
i order televisions because i have a lot of stuff and i like nice brand new  they're all made in south korea, most  other than sony, and sony, in all fairness, has lost its way
but a lot of them  samsung, all of them
i mean, they're all pretty much  all of them, right
i think just about
but i order thousands of televisions, they're all from south korea
so we have 28,000 people on the border separating south korea from this maniac in north korea, we get nothing
what do  we get nothing
they're making a fortune
it's an economic behemoth
a lot of you don't know we protect germany
germany
mercedes benz, how many people have a mercedes benz
we protect germany
it's an economic behemoth
we protect saudi arabia
they were, during the good oil days  now it's probably half, which is fine
but during the good old  they were making a billion  listen to this  a billion dollars a day, and we protect them
our military  they pay us peanuts, like nothing
and then if we want to buy  we want to move to another location, well, that's very expensive if we do that
we want  they charge us rent
i mean, look
we are run by people that are so bad, they're so out of their league  and i see it, i see it on the stage
you know, they're  a lot of them are nice people
you know, a lot of people think i don't like these people
i do like them
but they don't have business sense, they don't have business ability, they don't have common sense
they're politicians, they're all talk, they're no action
when i say
folks, when i say, we're going to build a wall
most of them say, you can't build a wall  build a wall
in china 2,000 years ago, they built the great wall of china, which is bigger than any wall we're thinking about, ok
the great wall of china goes 18,000 miles
we have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across
we have 1,000 miles
so, china has 18,000 or 13,000 miles, and we have 1,000 miles
we have modern cranes
we have caterpillar tractors  i want to use caterpillar
i don't want to use komatsu
made in america
even my hats, they're made in america
it wasn't easy to find a guy that could do those hats
you know what i'm talking about
i see so many knock-offs of my hat, right
make america great again
i see these things that are out of plastic
they're out of all sorts of crap
mine are made in america
and honestly, they do a great job, but they don't produce as many as i'd like because, frankly, there's a big  i mean, it's amazing
those hats are amazing
but i wanted to have it made
and you know why i wanted it  i wanted it, anyway, but i also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things  we have a website  as soon as the hats came out, i knew the press would be calling
and it's true
first hour when the hats were announced, i get a call from the new york times
trump, where are those hats made
i said, america
i knew it
i knew it
because as you know, if i would have said china, i would have been in big, big trouble
but they're being knocked off all over the world
i mean, i see hats  they're like helmets
i see them all
but what are you going to do
but here's the story
we've got to build a wall
so when i talk and when i'm up on the stage with these guys, these people  wonderful people  and a very nice woman, carly
she's a nice woman
when i'm up on the stage with them, they think i'm crazy when i say mexico  i'm saying, we're going to build a wall
it's going to be a great wall
it's going to be real wall
see this ceiling
this ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall i'm talking about
i'm talking about a van to get up there
they're not coming down because it's too dangerous
all right
did you ever see what they do now
we have these little walls
they build ramps
they build a ramp
i say, wouldn't it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just and then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs
do you see this
they build ramps
there was a picture in time magazine
it's a ramp  a little ramp that goes over the wall
so, they have a jeep  over, down, bump, make money
we get the drugs
think of it
we  build a wall is right
you've got to build a wall
we get the drugs
they get the cash
no so good, right
we don't like that deal
our politicians don't know  they don't know
so when i say mexico's going to pay for it, these guys on the stage with me, they're not business people
they don't understand
mexico makes a fortune off the united states
number one, we give them a lot of money
but in addition to that, they're taking our businesses
they're making  you talk about a trade deficit
i'll tell you what, mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new china
mexico is making an absolute fortune  peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall
let's say the cost of the wall is $10 billion
that's a good  i can do great job at $10 billion
i think we'll have a lot of money left over
somebody else would  and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall
people that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall
you know one of the reasons they didn't build the wall
because of the environmental protection agency, they couldn't get an environmental impact study approved
can you believe it
because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way
now, think of it
in china, in the south china sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top
china sends in massive excavators and they're (inaudible)
they're building military fortresses in the south china sea
and a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in china  he's a great guy
they're great people
they're fine
they're just too smart
i mean, the leaders are too smart for our people
they won't be too smart when i put my people there
when they call up, we'd like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it
no, no
the donor now is carl icahn
you're going to speak to carl icahn
you know carl  great businessman
you have so many people  they call all these business people  call
so, a friend of mine, so i call him, i say, you're actually doing that
and then jokingly, i said, how long did it take to get started
did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate
he looked at me, goes, i  i hope you're kidding when you say that
they conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, ok
there is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail
you're going to hurt this
you are going to  they are doing a big thing
they excavated  massive, massive  take a look, massive
the biggest excavation
they are ripping the hell out of that ocean
they are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it  and they're building air fields and they're building forts
we couldn't do it because, just like i said for the law
legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement
now, that's probably not the only reason it didn't happen
i heard their costs were too high
with me, that's easy
you know, i'm doing the old post office or watch (ph) you (ph)
i'm under budget, i'm ahead of schedule
hey, look at the campaign
the guy's at $59 million and he's down at the bottom
i'm nothing and i'm at the top
it's the same thing
i actually said  it's funny
the other day i got this great review
they said trump is a great speaker
the crowd is spellbound
but he has one problem
and i'm reading, and i want to see
the problem is, he speaks through the applause
in other words, like i say that, you applaud, i start talking you finish your applause
and you know why
because i'm so excited, because we have so much potential
it's true
i don't want to wait for your freaking applause
we have  i have so many  we have so much potential
there are so many things to do
i don't really sort of want to wait
i want to do it
and i just noticed, i did it again
you were getting ready to give a big applause, because you like that, and i'm speaking
i killed the applause
but he is right
but except, i'm not a speaker
what i am is a doer
i get things done
so, when the people up on the stage with me  and hillary, hillary doesn't have a clue
by the way, you talk about low energy
she has lower energy than jeb bush, which is hard to believe
she does
and i'll tell you and i've been saying it
and maybe it's rude, maybe it is not
but it doesn't matter
we have a much bigger problem
we have to save our country
so, if i'm rude and if people think i'm rude  i'm actually a nice person
i have a big heart
i want to help people
i want to help the migration
i want to do a safe zone in syria
i don't want them coming here
we don't know who these people are
they are undocumented
and we should do a safe zone over there
we should have the gulf states  saudi arabia and these states they are not spending
they have got to spend
they have to pay
you know, we are protecting them
we're doing  they wouldn't be there for two minutes if we weren't protecting them
they have to start paying
they are not taking anybody, ok
how about germany taking millions of migrants
can you believe what she is doing to that country
and she was the person of the year and i wasn't
everybody said trump was supposed to
(booing)
hey, what are you going to do
i think she has made a terrible mistake
we will find out
time will tell
they have tremendous crime problems
i think she has made a tremendous mistake
but what i like is in syria, with other people's money, meaning the gulf states and others and germany and others
because, look, germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people
they'll give us the money
we do a massive safe zone
and then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which i will probably be able to get it straightened out, i understand this now
but once it's straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area
it is interesting, i have thousands of people that work for me
thousands
and i have people that come from far  they are all here legally, don't worry about it
i use e- verify
but i have people  oh, they go and check
these guys go check
they went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally
they said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds
i don't believe it
but, you know, it is possible somebody slipped  hey, we do have 11 million people in the country
and it is probably a much higher number than that, ok
it is probably a much higher number
but we have to do something about it and we are going to
so, i just want to finish by saying this
look, we have a situation that is out of control
our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world
we are laughed at by the rest of the world
and when i started this journey, and it is a journey, and i do love you people
you're amazing people
and by the way, you are so smart
a lot of times, they will say, well mr
trump's people are blue-collar
i love blue-collar
i'm honored by that
but they are not blue-collar
we have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people
they say the audience is old
it's not older
the audience is young
the other night in iowa, i told that, and i said, we have so many young people and the place erupted
they are all young people
we have an amazing thing happening, it's just
look, that's their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you
it is disgusting
but when i started this journey and that's what it is, it's a journey and it's a movement that's taking place
it's a movement
remember the old days
silent majority
it's not right
it's a noisy majority
people are angry
it's a noisy majority
these aren't silent people anymore
i go to people  you can't even hear
this is an amazing thing that's happened
i received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but that's ok
(inaudible) a couple of them, right
but, a guy who's really respected, recently, and he said, how does it feel
i said, how does what feel
he said, what you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the united states
i mean, even cnn said, number one political story of the year is trump
you know what number two was
isis  isis was two
i'd rather reverse it
let isis be one
let me be two, because i want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year
make me number one next year
but this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy
he said  he said, what you've done has never been done before in the history of this country
newt gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, this is one the great phenomenons (ph) i've ever seen in politics
nobody's ever seen it
crowds like this
forget it
i mean, it's only confined to this (inaudible)
again, they sent 3,000 people home
can you believe it
more than 3,000
it's  it's unbelievable what's happening
it's beautiful what's happening
it's beautiful what's happening
but newt gingrich said he's never seen anything like this
but he said to me, the reporter, he said, never been done before
i said, well, you know, it's fine, but if i don't win, it's just a waste of time
he goes, no, no, no
what you've done is incredible
he said, even if you don't win, what you've done is incredible
you've totally changed the landscape of politics
no, don't applaud, don't applaud, don't applaud
he said, you've totally changed the landscape of politics
it's forever going to be different
your campaign  there's never been anything like it
ok, he was very nice
i said, you don't understand
you don't understand
if i don't win, i will consider this  and i mean this  a total and complete waste of time
i really do
so  because we're not going to do anything
it's wonderful
oh, good, i had nice crowds
they'll write about me every once in a while
every two years i'll have a story, trump ran this rather good campaign
if we don't win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don't win, it's a terrible waste of time, because you'll have somebody else in there
they won't be able to do what i do
they're not going to be able to
and even if you get one of these republicans in, like, i didn't finish the  so, the wall
when i say mexico is going to pay, they all laugh
they all go heh, heh, heh
they think it's funny
honestly, these are people  they think it's funny
they're laughing
you know, lightly, like oh ho, that's so funny
ha, ha, ha
they're going to pay for the wall, folks
they're making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with mexico
the wall is peanuts
they're going to pay for the wall
but i mention it, now they don't laugh because they're starting to agree with me
and then the other day, one of the people said  it was ted cruz, who is a nice guy
but he said, we're going to build a wall at the southern border
i said, look  and my wife is sitting (inaudible)  where did that come from, right
no, ted's a good guy
but he said on one of  i think it was on fox, he was being interviewed
and he said, we're going to build a wall at the southern border
he didn't say mexico was going to pay was going to pay
he hasn't gone that far yet, but believe me that's going to happen
see, they're all trying to catch up with me
because when i did this stuff, it was very out there
now, i'm the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to
but what happens is  so ted's up and he's talking
and, you know, routinely we're going to have the border
we're going to have this and that
and we're going to build a wall
my wife is sitting there
she says, darling, did you hear that
he just said they're going to build a wall
that's the first time i've  you know, that's what you say
she hasn't heard that from any other candidate
so we're going to build a wall
mexico is going to pay for it
there are so many things we're going to do
but when i  when i started the journey, it was amazing
i came down  it took courage
i went down in to the lobby of trump tower, on the escalator with melania
i have never seen  it looked like the academy awards, the press
we have a lot of press here today
they're all live  look at all those live cameras
so when i came down  when i came down on the escalator, we came down
and i said, we're going to do things
and i mentioned illegal immigration
you wouldn't even be talking about illegal  it wasn't even on the radar
nobody was talking about illegal immigration
is that right
now, it's one of the big subjects
and that's why  and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and i'm so proud of it, cnn just came out with a poll a couple of, i guess a week ago  36 percent for trump
second is 16
third is 14
then 12
so they're way down
but on the economy, they give me 55  55 percent
that's with 16 people at the time
on the budget, i mean, i understand  the budget, the economy, i win  i win it hands down, all right
but listen to this
on illegal immigration, i'm almost at 50 percent
and on isis, likewise, almost at 50 percent
so people want to be protected, they want to feel safe
they need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts
i don't want to be tough  you know, i know a lot of tough guys but they're not smart, and they're the  they're the easiest
you can be tough, you've got to be smart
let's start smart first
you've got to be smart-tough
you've got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us
so what happens is this
i came out, i started  i did it, i was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and mexico and all of this stuff
then kate was killed in san francisco and jamiel was killed in los angeles
jamiel shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant
kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back
so many great people
and that's  these are two, so many
and then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren't paying taxes and all of this stuff, right
and all of a sudden, people are coming over, and i say the wall and now they're starting to say the wall
we have to be progressive in our thinking
when i say progressive, i mean like smart
i'm not talking progressive like a bernie sanders would say, the guy want to tax you
think of it
think of it
this guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent
no, no, think  you'll have to move out of this  i love this area, by the way
i've been here many times
great golfing area, right
we love it
no more golf if bernie sanders  no more golf
no, no, you won't have any golf anymore
there won't be  you won't have any money left to be  you'll be paying it in taxes
this guy is a total disaster
and i'm not saying that  i'll tell you why
you know, hillary said well, i'd like to run against trump, believe me
this poor chuck todd, meet the press
his show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but i never liked it
you know, i just  he never treated me fairly
so i do his show, he gets the highest ratings he's had in years
he went from, like  believe me, i won't even give you the numbers, they were massive, the numbers, right
i saved his life, and then he goes hillary clinton said that she would most like to run against donald trump
and yes  and they're looking forward to it
trust me, the last person  she's already gotten a dose last night, do you agree
she had a tough night
she had a tough one
she had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, ok
so hillary clinton said  and here's chuck todd  and he's a nice guy
i'm not trying to knock him
please don't be insulted, chuck
but she says she doesn't like him
but he doesn't treat me right
so he goes the clinton campaign said they'd most like to run against trump, like i'm some kind of a sap
so i call him and i say chuck, let me explain something
when they say they want to run against me, that means they don't want to run against me, do you understand that
do you understand it's reverse psychology
they say they want to run against me  first of all, i'm winning and tied in the polls now and i haven't even hit her yet
but look at what happened to all the guys i hit
they're gonzo, they're gone or they're failing badly, ok, and they'll be gone soon
but hillary clinton  think of it
i say so chuck, report it like properly
trust me, they don't want to run against trump
the last thing she wants in her whole life is  this was only  i did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband's one of the great abusers of the world
give me a break
give me a break
give me a break
so the last person she wants to run against is me
now here's the story
look, here's the story
it's very simple
so i announced  and i was talking about trade, i was talking about the wall, i was talking about the borders, i was talking about obamacare, i was talking about the 2nd amendment will be saved, by the way
the 2nd amendment
it will be saved
the 2nd amendment is going to be with us if i'm president
you know, they're doing everything
they want to get rid of the bullets now, they're doing everything they can
think of paris, think of los angeles
think if you had some guns in paris on the good side, right
they had no guns
paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks
and france  i mean, you get caught with a gun, it's  the only one that has guns are the bad guys
so they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind
he's a moron
i mean, this guy was a moron
i call him the guy with the dirty hat, right
they got him so good
by the way, the french police did a great job and our los angeles police did a phenomenal job
they did a great job
wouldn't it be wonderful if, let's see, this guy right here in front of me, he's a tough guy
this guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but he's a strong-looking guy right here
this guy right there, see
and that one
wouldn't it be nice if they had a gun on their waist
somebody
him, him, him, so that when they  you know what they were doing in paris
get over here, boom
get over here, boom
your turn, get over here, boom
one hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals
other people are going to die
same thing over there
these are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage
there's something going on, folks
it's wrong
they gave them a party
they worked  they gave them a party
she came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized
and people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs  who the hell doesn't know
you're their next door neighbor
and they didn't want to talk about it
you've got to report these people
we've got a real problem
you've got to report them
no more nonsense
they didn't report them, and the reason they didn't is because they don't disagree with them so much
believe me
it's not because they were afraid
you saw the one who wasn't politically correct to (ph) report them
they didn't want to report them
i mean, give me a break
so we have to change
so it started off with me where i was going to talk about trade, i was going to talk about all the things, i was going to talk about the military, building it up
i was going to do all of this, but after paris and california, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after paris and california, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points
it's amazing
they went up 10 points
i said, what, you think it was the debate
because i did good in the debate
they said, no
people view you as a tough cookie that's not going to take this crap
that's what it is
and now i talk about protection
i talk about  trust me
the trade  that's so easy for me
i've got the greatest guys in the world
they're going to come in, they're going to do a great job
i'm going to do some myself
i always talk about ford
they're going to built a plant, $2
5 billion in mexico
that's not going to happen with me
that stuff is  those deals are no good
ford's leaving
they're closing plants all over michigan to build a plant in  in mexico
how the hell does that help us
who are the people that think this is a good thing for us
and in the meantime, in michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and they're spending  think about a $2
5 billion  then they're going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the united states, no tax, no nothing
i'll say you don't have to pay a tax, folks
and you know what
ford will say if i (inaudible) pay a tax, we're going to stay in the united states
i mean, it's very simple
it's very simple
how about two weeks ago, nabisco announced a big  chicago
they announced they're going to leave chicago with one of their big plants and they're going to move it to mexico
what's my statement
we're not eating oreos anymore, right
no more
but i don't want this
it's not going to happen
then they're make  they're going to make product and they're going to sell it into the united states
not going to happen
it's not going to happen
and by the way, i'm a free trader
i believe  we've got to be smart
i mean, we've got to get something
we don't get anything out of anything
we don't get anything
we lose on everything
that iran deal was a disaster
by the way, think of the iran deal for one second
i always  and this came to me two weeks ago
i don't know why i didn't think of it sooner
very disappointed with myself
the iran deal is the worst deal i've ever seen negotiated, ok
i'm wrong
you know what the worst deal is
iran's a part of that one too
we gave them iraq
that's even better
think of it
we gave iran iraq
iran has the biggest  think of it
they're going to have the richest oil  if you go to iraq, take a look
among the largest oil reserves in the world
we gave them, by decapitating iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give iraq
so not only did they make a great deal in terms of the iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them iraq
we gave them iraq, that they've been after for 100 years
we handed it to them
so now, they have the largest oil reserves among  in the world
that's even better than the original deal
i mean, whoever is representing iran is doing a hell of a job
if that was a stock, you've got to buy some
so we are not going to have deals like that with me
it's not going to happen
we're going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again
and
and you're going to remember this moment
this is going to be an important moment for all of us
the one thing i have to say and i have to ask you to do, go out and vote
it's going to be your turn
number three
remember, it starts on february 1st with iowa
we go to new hampshire, then we go to the finals (ph), so three weeks
we've got four weeks to go, and then we have three weeks after we start
no matter what is going on in your life, you have got to out and vote
because if you don't, it's not going to happen
don't sit back and say, oh, trump is going to do well
the more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate
but you have got to go out and vote
and i will tell you this
it has been an honor to be here, i love this area, i love the people here
it's been an honor
but we will make america great again, i promise

trump
thank you, south carolina

the momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that's because my father's message resonants so deeply with so many people
so as our family we're incredibly proud
we're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us
and i will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you
so together we'll make america great again
thank you
thank you very much
thank you very much
so i was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what i was watching
and some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much
but a number of the pundits said, well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it's going to equal trump
but these geniuses   they're geniuses   they don't understand that as people drop out i'm going to get a lot of those votes also
you don't just
you don't just add them together
so i think we're going to do very, very well
i think we're going to do very well
i want to also congratulate the other candidates
in particular i have to say ted and marco did a really good job and they got   they did quite well as i understand
no, come on
just one minute
come on
one second, right
good
we go back to war tomorrow morning
tomorrow morning we'll be back but i just want to congratulate the other candidates
there's nothing easy about running for president, i can tell you
it's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious, it's beautiful
(laughter)
when you win it's beautiful and we're going to start   we are going to start winning for our country
we're going to start winning
because our country doesn't win anymore
doesn't win
we don't win with the military, we can't beat isis
we have great military but we can't beat isis
we don't win on trade
you look at what china's doing to us, what japan does to us, what mexico is just killing us at the border   at the border and with trade
mexico is killing us   absolutely
we'll do the wall
don't worry
we're going to do the wall
we're going to do the wall and by the way, who's going to pay for the wall
mexico's going to pay for the wall and it's very easy
the other politicians come down, you can't get mexico to pay for the wall
i said, 100 percent
we have a $58 billion trade deficit with mexico
the wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, ok
believe me, they will pay
one of the officials   actually, one of the ex-officials from mexico had a news conference
and he announced that we will not be paying for the wall
who does mr
trump think he is
they came to me   the press
these people   look at all those cameras back there
the press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall
do you have a comment
i said, yes
the wall just got 10 feet taller
it's true
and i love mexico
i love mexico, i love china, i love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incomptent and don't know what they're doing
i love these countries
they're great
i have thousands and thousands of hispanics
we're going to nevada
i lead   i lead with the hispanics
i'm leading in every poll with the hispanics
they love me, i love them
the problem is   the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's mexico or japan or viet nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or china in particular   that's the big one
the greatest abuse of a country that i think i've ever seen financially   china
what they've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world
they've taken our jobs, they've taken our money, they've taken everything
we're bringing our jobs back, folks
we're bringing our jobs back
we're going to bring them back
and i know how to do it
we've had so many   we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important
carl icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me
and we're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when china wants to come and negotiate, they're going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now
they're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country
so we're going to do a lot of beautiful work
we're going to terminate obamacare
it's going to terminated
it's going to be over
it's going to be repealed and it's going to be replaced
and you're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because obamacare   if you look   look at the increases in your obamacare
twenty-five, 35, 45, even 55 percent
it's dead
it's not working
we're going to go to a plan that's going to be so much better and so much less expensive
so second amendment by the way   this is a room loves the second amendment
thank you, fellows
this is a room loves and cherishes the second amendment
we are going to protect our second amendment
totally
common core is gone
we are getting rid of common core
we're brining education to a local level
the people in this community   every time i see them they want education locally
the parents, the teachers
they want to do it   they don't want bureaucrats in washington telling them how to educate their children
we spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world
not even close
more per pupil   second place doesn't even exist it's so different
and yet out of 30 countries we're ranked number 30
you have china, you have norway, swenden, denmark and then you have number 30, the united states
so we spend the most and we're at the bottom of the heap
it's not going to happen anymore, folks
it's not going to happen anymore
we are going to build our military which i thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in washington i   we love our military
we love our military
and by the way we love our police
our police are terrific
we love our police
they are not being treated properly
we're going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks
and we're going to buy   we're going to buy the equipment that our generals, our soldiers, that everybody that's in the know want
we're not buying equipment that sells because they have political pull (ph)
because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions
we are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in washington
we're going to have great equipment
and the reason i can say that is i'm self-funding my campaign
i'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these
i'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want
that's not going to happen
and we're going to take care of our vets
we love our vets and they're being treated terribly
we're taking care of our vets
so we're now off to nevada and it's a great state
we have great people
we have great people in our nation
no matter where we go   i went to mobile, alabama   35,000 people
we went to oklahoma recently twice   20,000 people, 20,000 people
no matter where we go we fill up the arenas
over here the other day we had a 9,000   we had a 10,000   we have people
the only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can't get them in
we have to send thousands of people away
time magazine   time magazine last year did an incredible cover story
they said it's a movement
and that's what it is
it's an incredible movement with incredible people
incredible people
it's an incredible movement with incredible people
i tell you
and whether we go   honestly whether we go to dallas or whether we go anywhere you say   you go to l
you go anywhere you say
our people are incredible
and our theme   what's our theme
you know it, right
our theme which i love may be the greatest theme of all time, right
and the word again eventually is going to come off
we're going to get rid of the whole theme because what's going to happen   make america great again, right
and the last two weeks because i've gotten to see so many   i guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches
and i've met so many people
but the people are so incredible that i've been saying make america great again and it's going to be greater than ever before
that's the kind of potential we have
greater then every before
i don't see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement i made on june 16th during my presidential announcement speech
here is what i said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media
when mexico (meaning the mexican government) sends its people, they're not sending their best
they're not sending you (pointing to the audience)
they're not sending you (pointing again)
they're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us
they're bringing drugs
they're bringing crime
they're rapists
and some, i assume, are good people
but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting
and it only makes common sense
they're sending us not the right people
it's coming from more than mexico
it's coming from all over south and latin america, and it's coming probably from the middle east
but we don't know
because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening
and it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast
what can be simpler or more accurately stated
the mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the united states
they are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc
this was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in san francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the united states because they didn't want him in mexico
this is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the united states
in other words, the worst elements in mexico are being pushed into the united states by the mexican
government
the largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are mexican cartels that arrange to have mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs
the border patrol knows this
likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border
the united states has become a dumping ground for mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world
on the other hand, many fabulous people come in from mexico and our country is better for it
but these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally
i am proud to say that i know many hard working mexicansmany of them are working for and with meand, just like our country, my organization is better for it
the mexican government wants an open border as long as it's a one way open border into the united states
not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade  and the country of mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so
i have great respect for mexico and love their people and their peoples' great spirit
the problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours
to the citizens of the united states, who i will represent far better than anyone else as president, the mexican government is not our friendand why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade
i have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something mexico doesn't want me to say
in actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that univision, previously my friend, went ballistic
i believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the united states was of even more concern to the mexican government than my talk of border security
i have lost a lot during this presidential run defending the people of the united states
i have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for president
macy's, nbc, serta and nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country
univision, because 70% of their business comes from mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the mexican government
the last thing mexico wants is donald trump as president in that i will make great trade deals for the united states and will have an impenetrable border only legally approved people will come through easily
interestingly, univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful ipo or high stock pricenot to mention that i am currently suing them for breach of contract
remember, univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of hillary clinton's biggest backers
after the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave reviewsthere was very little criticism
it wasn't until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words
if there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm
the issues i have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to make america great again
additionally, i would be the best jobs president that god ever created
let's get to work
trump
(off-mike) this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what's going on, and especially how poor she'd do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism
trump
even her former secret service agent, who's seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president
there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and i will deliver that speech very, very soon
but today, there's only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders
the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando, florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since september 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history
so many people  it's just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace
the horror is beyond description
the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever
likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated
we express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families
we mourn as one people for our nation's loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it
i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack
thank you
our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando's lgbt community
they have been through something that nobody could ever experience
this is a very dark moment in america's history
a radical islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation
it's a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation
it's an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity
it's an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country
we need to respond to this attack on america as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination
but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly
we're not acting clearly, we're not talking clearly, we've got problems
if we don't get tough, and if we don't get smart, and fast, we're not going to have our country anymore
there will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left
the killer, whose name i will not use, or ever say, was born in afghan, of afghan parents, who immigrated to the united states
his father published support for the afghan taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views, and they murdered plenty
the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan
the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here
that is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about
we have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly
we have an incompetent administration
and if i'm elected president, that will not change, i will tell you, that will not change over the next four years
we have an administration that will not change
but if i get in there, it's going to change, and it's going to change quickly
we're going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me
trump
thank you
with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore
we have to address these issues head-on
i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so
and although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on
we have to do it
it will be lifted  this ban  when and as a nation we're in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country
they're pouring in and we don't know what we're doing
the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons
now, any class  it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states
and it's as he or she deems appropriate
hopefully it's he in this case
thank you
i will use this power to protect the american people
when i'm elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there's a proven history of terrorism against the united states, europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats
after a full
thank you
and by the way we have no choice
after a full and partial and long  really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america
we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer
many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions
remember this, radical islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- american
i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people, christian people, jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence
this is not just a national security issue
it's a quality of life issue
if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans  women and children, gay and straight, jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now
we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores
and it's coming
with these people, folks, it's coming
we're importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president
even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we're letting into america
all of the september 11th hijackists were issued visas
large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis
the boston bombers came here through political asylum
the male shooter in san bernardino again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs
trump
immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five fold  five fold in just one year
according to pew research, 99 percent of the people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law
we admit many more, and that's just the way it is
we admit many more from other countries in the region
and i'll tell you what
they share these oppressive views and values
we want to remain a free and open society
then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders
we have to control, and we have to control them now, not later
right now
thank you
yet hillary clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday
and, guess what, she will probably say them
she sort of has said them, but let's see what happens
she really has no choice, but she doesn't want to
however, she's really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words
she supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what's going wrong with our country and our borders
she has no clue, in my opinion, what radical islam is and she won't speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know
she's in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world  true weakness
i don't know if you know this, but just a few weeks before san bernardino, the slaughter, that's all it was was a slaughter, hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam
here is what she said, exact quote, muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism
that is hillary clinton
so, she says the solution is to ban guns
they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood
her plan is to disarm law abiding americans, abolishing the second amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns
no good
not going to happen, folks
not going to happen
not going to happen
thank you
she wants to take away american's guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us
let them come into the country, we don't have guns
let them come in, let them have all the fun they want
i will be meeting with the nra, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror
i will be always defending the second amendment
thank you
thank you
the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into american and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing
in fact, hillary clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life
when it comes to radical islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss
it's deadly  totally deadly
the obama administration, with the support of hillary clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information
we need this information so badly, and he stopped it
we don't have the support
we don't have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job
they are not being allowed to do their job
and, they can do it well  better than anybody
we need a new leader
we need a new leader fast
trump
thank you
they have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else
i refuse to be politically correct
i want to do the right thing
i want to straighten things out and i want to make america great again
the days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if i'm elected
as president i will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks
they don't have those tools now
we need an intelligence gathering system second to none
second to none
that includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly
i will have an attorney general, a director of national intelligence and a secretary of defense who'll know how to fight a war on radical islamic terrorism
and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now
it's not right
we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat
the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th
nearly a year ago, the senate subcommittee asked president obama's department of justice, state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states
these departments refused to comply
nobody even knows why
they refused to comply
president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since september 11th
so important
the public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here
we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple
we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america
not complicated
every – and just think of this
take a look
every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases
just a single event
and just one person
can you imagine what they'll do in large groups, which we're allowing now to come here
truly our president doesn't know what he's doing
he's failed us and he's failed us badly
under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse
and i've been saying that for a long time
each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east
our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security
in fact, clinton's state department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas
having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country
tell me, tell me – how stupid is that
this could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was
altogether, under the clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children
not only their children, by the way, they're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don't know what's happening
trump
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen
we're not screening people
so why don't we have an effective screening system
we don't
we're being laughed at all over the world
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term
wouldn't this be money better spent rebuilding america for our current population including the many poor people already living here
we have cities, we have inner cities
we have poverty all over and this is how we're spending billions of dollars
we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states
we don't know who they are, they have no documentation and we don't know what they're planning and we won't unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case they're out of here
what i want
what i want is common sense
i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values
that's a choice i put before the american people
a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests
that's all it is
we've got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we've got to do it now because later is too late  going to be too late for our country
the media talks about home grown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that's a very, very important term  a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don't like it
yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past
but the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing people who add to the problem
and that's what they're doing
we're letting all of these people  hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they're doing is adding to this incredible problem we have
for instance, the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot
this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth
why would we admit people who support violent hatred
hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views or values
she can't have it both ways
she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities
how does this kind of immigration make our lives better
how does this kind of immigration make our country better
why does hillary clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values
why
explain
ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the lgbt community, donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words
trump
i will tell you who the better friend is and some day i believe that will be proven out bigly (ph)
and by the way the lgbt community is just  what's happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a disgrace to that community, i will tell you right now
clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country
they enslave women, and they murder gays
i don't want them in our country
immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities
all of our communities, every single one of them
americans already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, anybody in the world
four times more
at least, because we don't even know who's coming in
and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny
not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged
in almost 20 years
you wonder why we get the crowds, you wonder why we get this tremendous support, you wonder why i've gotten more votes than any republican in any primary in the history of the republican party
take a look at that
take a look at your security, take a look at the wages
for 18 years they've been stagnant, they've even gone down
so whether it's a matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this
cannot afford it
we owe $19 trillion in debt
and no longer have any options
our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief
this is not an act of offense against anyone
it's really an act of defense
i want us all, all of us, to work together
we have to form a partnership, with our muslim communities
we have muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership
now, the muslim community, so important
they have to work with us
they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad
they know it
and they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith
i want to fix our schools
i want to fix our bridges
and our jobs market, we're going to have it rocket again, we're going to make great trade deals
but i want every american to succeed including muslims
but the muslims have to work with us
they have to work with us
they know what's going on
they know that he was bad
they knew the people in san bernardino were bad
but you know what
they didn't turn them in
and you know what
we had death, and destruction
hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens
i want to protect our citizens, all of our citizens
the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault
in san bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it
they said oh, we thought so but we didn't want to use racial profiling
which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they don't get in trouble
we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates
we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status
we have to know, and we have to know fast
we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with
we need to know, and we need to make sure, every single last person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us, is brought to justice, so when people know what's going on and they don't tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences
big consequences
america must do more  much more  to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in orlando
trump
it also means we must change our foreign policy
the decision to overthrow the regime in libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before
these actions, along with our disastrous iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region
that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation building
no more nation building
it's never going to work
and by the way we've spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been complete and total disaster
we're further away now than we were 15 years ago
for instance, the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya
that mission helped to unleash isis on a new continent
i've said nato need to change its focus and stop terrorism
we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism
since i've raised that criticism and it's ok
i've gotten no credit for it but these are minor details  nato has since announced a new initiative  front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that
america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism
pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war
we tried it president obama's way, doesn't work
he gave the world his apology tour
we got isis and many other problems in return
that's what we got
remember the famous apology tour
we're sorry for everything
i'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solitarily with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack
when i'm president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders
wherever they come from, wherever they were born, i don't care
all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected
thank you
thank you
we're going to be tough and we're going to be smart and we're going to do it right
america will be a tolerant and open society
america will also be a safe society
we will protect our borders at home
we will defeat isis overseas
we have no choice
we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety
we will make america rich again
we will make america safe again
we will make america great again
thank you
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much, everybody
appreciate it
thank you
good evening
thank you very much
i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel
i am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the jewish state
in late 2001, weeks after the attacks on new york city, and on washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalists, mayor rudy giuliani visited israel to show solidarity with terror victims
i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percent
in spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the gaza strip, i was the grand marshal of the 40th salute to israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state
it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel, many people turned down this honor
i did not
i took the risk and i'm glad i did
but i didn't come here tonight to pander to you about israel
that's what politicians do
all talk, no action, believe me
i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother
the only democracy in the middle east, the state of israel
my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran
i have been in business a long time
i know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for america, for israel, and for the whole of the middle east
the problem here is fundamental
we have rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return
i've studied this issue in great detail
i would say actually, greater by far than anybody else
believe me, and it's a bad deal
the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has
the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock
and of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them
the deal doesn't even require iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability
yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years
but when those restrictions expire, iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad iran's behavior is
terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially israel
when i'm president, i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to iran
first, we will stand up to iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region
iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if i'm not elected president, i know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why i'm going to be elected president folks
and we are leading in every poll, remember that please
iran is a problem in iraq, a problem in syria, a problem in lebanon, a problem in yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for saudi arabia
literally every day, iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states
hezbollah, lebanon received, and i'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and gps systems and rockets
like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have
now they're in syria trying to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the golan heights
in gaza, iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad
and in the west bank they're openly offering palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every palestinian terrorist's home that's been destroyed
a deplorable, deplorable situation
iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east, and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror
secondly, we will totally dismantle iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us
iran has seeded terror groups all over the world
during the last five years, iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents
they've got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home
iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me
third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold iran totally accountable
and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before folks
believe me
iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times
those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten europe, and maybe someday hit even the united states
and we're not going to let that happen
we're not letting it happen, and we're not letting it happen to israel, believe me
do you want to hear something really shocking
as many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both hebrew and farsi, were the words israel must be wiped off the face of the earth
you can forget that
what kind of demented minds write that in hebrew
and here's, you talk about twisted, here's another twisted part
testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made
the deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate united nations security council resolutions
the problem is, no one has done anything about it
we will, we will, i promise we will
which brings me to my next point
the utter weakness and incompetence of the united nations
the united nations is not a friend of democracy
it's not a friend to freedom
it's not a friend even to the united states of america, where as you know, it has its home
and it surely is not a friend to israel
with president obama in his final year, yay
he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel, believe me
believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody
so with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine
let me be clear
an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster
the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which i will use as president, 100 percent
when people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal
deals are made when parties come together
they come to a table and they negotiate
each side must give up something it values, i mean we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires
that's what a deal is
a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something
that's not going to happen with the united nations
it will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize israel
it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel
it's not going to happen folks
and further, it would reward palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing israelis, and even americans
just last week, american taylor allen force, a west point grad, phenomenol young person who served in iraq and afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding palestinian
you don't reward behavior like that
you can not do it
there is only one way you treat that kind of behavior
you have to confront it
so, it's not up the united nations to go with a solution
it's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves
you have no choice
they have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway
the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to israel, to anything in the area
it's so preposterous
we're not going to let that happen
when i'm president, believe me, i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state
it will be vetoed 100 percent
you see, i know about deal-making
that's what i do
i wrote ‘the art of the deal'
one of the best-selling, all-time, and i mean seriously, i'm saying ‘one of', because i'll be criticized as though i say ‘the', so i'm going to be very diplomatic
one of i'll be criticized
i think it is number one, but why take a chance
one of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making
to make a great deal, you need two willing participants
we know israel is willing to deal
israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years
you had camp david in 2000, where prime minister barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous
arafat rejected it
in 2008, prime minister olmert made an equally generous offer
the palestinian authority rejected it also
then john kerry tried to come up with a framework and abbas didn't even respond, not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america
they didn't even respond
when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one
and when i say something, i mean it
i mean it
i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately
i have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region
meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and hate the jews
it has to stop
when you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero's, little kids want to be firefighters
when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars
in palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder jews
we can't let this continue
we can't let this happen any longer
you cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs
glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace
it is a horrible, horrible way to think
it's a barrier that can't be broken
that will end, and it'll end soon, believe me
in palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out, and they've got to start this educational process
they have to end education of hatred
they have to end it, and now
there is no moral equivalency
israel does not name public squares after terrorists
israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians
you see, what president obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies
and you see that happening all the time
that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former secretary of state, hillary clinton, who is a total disaster by the way
she and president obama have treated israel very, very badly
but its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate america
we saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community
it didn't happen
president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happened
already, half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it's a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the united states
we'll get it solved, one way or the other
we will get it solved
but when the united states stands with israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially
that's what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states
we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people, jerusalem
and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally, the state of israel
the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable
they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel
they must do that
and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish state
i love the people in this room
i love israel
i love israel
i've been with israel so long in terms of, i've received some of my greatest honors from israel
my father before me, incredible
my daughter ivanka is about to have a beautiful jewish baby
in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as i'm concerned
so i want to thank you very much
this has been a truly great honor
thank you everybody
thank you
thank you very much
wow
thank you very much
hello
i'd like to begin by thanking the people of montana, south dakota, new mexico, new jersey and california
we had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers
i'm truly honored by your support
together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we're only getting started and it's going to be beautiful, remember that
tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another
our campaign received more primary votes than any gop campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes
this is a great feeling
that's a great feeling
this is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not obama change, but real change is possible
you've given me the honor to lead the republican party to victory this fall
we're going to do it
we're going to do it, folks
we're going to do it
i understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and i will never, ever let you down – too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears
i'm never going to let you down
i will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that's what it is, is a movement
now recent polls have shown that i'm beating hillary clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she's made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially
to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, i want to thank you
i want to thank you very, very much
to those who voted for someone else in either party, i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support
to all of those bernie sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms
and by the way, the terrible trade deals that bernie was so vehemently against and he's right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that's what i do
we are going to have fantastic trade deals
we're going to start making money and bringing in jobs
now i know some people say i'm too much of a fighter
my preference is always peace, however and i've shown that
i've shown that for a long time
i built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always
my goal is always again to bring people together
but if i'm forced to fight for something i really care about, i will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down
thank you
i've fought for my family
i've fought for my business
i've fought for my employees
and now, i'm going to fight for you, the american people like nobody has ever fought before
and i'm not a politician fighting, i'm me
you're going to see some real good things happen
just remember this
i'm going to be your champion
i'm going to be america's champion because you see this election isn't about republican or democrat
it's about who runs this country – the special interests or the people and i mean the american people
every election year politicians promise change
obama promised change and it didn't work out too well
and every year they fail to deliver
why would politicians want to change a system that's totally rigged in order to keep them in power
that's what they're doing, folks
why would politicians want to change a system that's made them and their friends very, very wealthy
i beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you could've done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win
37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people
after years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned – we can't fix the rigged system by relying on very, and i mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently
we can't solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems
the clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves
they've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and i mean hundreds of millions of dollars
secretary clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server
something about how she's getting away with this folks nobody understands
designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her – not right
i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the clintons
i think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting
i wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows
hillary clinton turned the state department into her private hedge fund – the russians, the saudis, the chinese – all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return
it's a sad day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens
i didn't need to do this
it's not easy, believe me
i didn't need to do it
but i felt i had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family
i've traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people's eyes
i've visited communities in new york, new jersey, pennsylvania, connecticut, indiana and ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it's horrible
i've embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn't have been in the country – remember it, folks, remember it
i visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools
i've seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and i've compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it's really not to be believed, hard to imagine what's happened to our country
america is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder
we're broke, we're broke
we owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion
our infrastructure is a disaster
our schools are failing
crime is rising
people are scared
the last thing we need is hillary clinton in the white house or an extension of the obama disaster
what a crowd, what a crowd
thank you all very much
we love our country, we love our country
but we can turn this all around
we're going to do it by putting america first
that commitment is the foundation for change that's been missing and it's been missing for a long time
it's important to understand what america first means
it means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation
it has to make us safer as a nation
this is the opposite of hillary's foreign policy which invaded libya, destabilized iraq, unleashed isis and threw syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the middle east and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks
we have made them that way
you better hope i'm president
on trade, america first means the american worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition
what's happening there is absolutely a disgrace
no ppp, you're right about that and you mean no pp
we are going, and remember this
we are only going to have great trade deals, ok
we are only going to have that
we're not going to approve, as somebody just said, the transpacific partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as nafta signed by bill clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular mexico
if it's not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it
it's got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we're suffering bigly and it's getting worse
on energy policy, america first means opening up america's great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration
on economic policy, america first means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the united states, substantially lowering taxes for middle class americans and business
likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level
we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country
on immigration policy, america first means protecting the jobs, wages and security of american workers, whether first or tenth generation
no matter who you are, we're going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies
the beauty of america first is that it brings us all together
every american worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges
it's got to be that way
now, the people in charge say things can't change
i'm here today to tell you that we have to change
we have no choice
we have to change
we're going to put america back to work
we're going to make our own products
we're going to put america back to work
we're going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad
we're going to take care of our african american people that have been mistreated for so long
we're going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again
together, we will put the american people first again, first again
we will make our communities wealthy
we will make our cities safe again
we will make our country strong again
ladies and gentlemen, we will make america great again, remember
thank you
thank you very much everybody
thank you for joining me today
this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and how bad a president, especially in these times of radical islamic terrorism, she would be
even her former secret service agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president
there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and i will deliver that speech soon
but today there is only one thing to discuss
the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders
the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando, florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since september 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history
so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace
the horror is beyond description
the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated
likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated
we express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families
we mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it
i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack
our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando's lgbt community
this is a very dark moment in america's history
a radical islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation
it is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation
it is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity
it is an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country
we need to respond to this attack on america as one united people – with force, purpose and determination
but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly
if we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore   there will be nothing left
the killer, whose name i will not use, or ever say, was born to afghan parents who immigrated to the united states
his father published support for the afghan taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views
the father even said he was running for president of that country
the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here
that is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about
we have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens
we have an incompetent administration, and if i am not elected president, that will not change over the next four years   but it must change, and it must change now
with fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore   we have to address it head on
i called for a ban after san bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying i was right to do so   and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on
the ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country
the immigration laws of the united states give the president the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the president deems detrimental to the interests or security of the united states, as he deems appropriate
i will use this power to protect the american people
when i am elected, i will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states, europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats
after a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america
we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer
many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions
radical islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-american
i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people, christian people, and jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence
it's not just a national security issue
it is a quality of life issue
if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans – women and children, gay and straight, jews and christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about radical islam
we need to tell the truth, also, about how radical islam is coming to our shores
we are importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system   and through an intelligence community held back by our president
even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into america
all of the september 11th hijackers were issued visas
large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis
the boston bombers came here through political asylum
the male shooter in san bernardino – again, whose name i won't mention   was the child of immigrants from pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from saudi arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs
immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five-fold in just one year
according to pew research, 99% of people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law
we admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views
if we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders
yet, hillary clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam, until i challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race
however, hillary clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what radical islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is
she is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world
in fact, just a few weeks before the san bernardino slaughter, hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam
here is what she said
muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism
hillary clinton says the solution is to ban guns
they tried that in france, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood
her plan is to disarm law-abiding americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns
she wants to take away americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us
i will be meeting with the nra, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror
the bottom line is that hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of radical islam into america, and allow it to grow overseas
in fact, hillary clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life
when it comes to radical islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly
the obama administration, with the support of hillary clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement
they have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else
i refuse to be politically correct
i will do the right thing i want to straighten things out and to make america great again
the days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon
as president i will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks
we need an intelligence-gathering system second to none
that includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies
i will have an attorney general, a director of national intelligence, and a secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done
we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat
the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th
nearly a year ago, the senate subcommittee asked president obama's departments of justice, state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states
these departments refused to comply
president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11
the public has a right to know how these people got here
we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs
we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america
even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in orlando
can you imagine large groups
truly, our president doesn't know what he is doing
he has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better   it will only get worse
each year, the united states permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the middle east, and many more from muslim countries outside the middle east
our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security
in fact, clinton's state department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas
having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in syrian refugees
this could be a better, bigger version of the legendary trojan horse
we can't let this happen
altogether, under the clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans
the burden is also on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it
her plan will cost americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term
wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding america for our current population, including the many poor people already living here
we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning
what i want is common sense
i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values
that is the choice i put before the american people
a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit america, or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests
we've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late
the media talks about homegrown, terrorism, but islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas
yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past
but the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem
for instance, the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot
this shooter in orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth
why would we admit people who support violent hatred
hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views
she can't have it both ways
she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them
how does this kind of immigration make our life better
how does this kind of immigration make our country better
why does hillary clinton want to bring people herein vast numberswho reject our values
ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the lgbt community, donald trump with his actions, or hillary clinton with her words
clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our countrythey enslave women, and murder gays
i don't want them in our country
immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities – all of our communities
america has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny
not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years
so whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this
we owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options
all our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief
this is not an act of offense against anyone
it is an act of defense
i want us all to work together, including in partnership with our muslim communities
but muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are
i want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market
i want every american to succeed
hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens
i want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens
the terrorist attack on the pulse night club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault
in san bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it
we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates
we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status
we need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with
we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice
if it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time
america must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations
it also means we must change our foreign policy
the decision to overthrow the regime in libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for isis to expand and grow
these actions, along with our disastrous iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region
that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism, not nation-building
for instance, the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya
that mission helped unleash isis on a new continent
i've said nato needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism
since i've raised that criticism, nato has since announced a new initiative focused on just that
america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the cold war
we've tried it president obama's way
he gave the world his apology tour, we got isis, and many other problems, in return
i'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under attack
when i am president, i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside of our borders
wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all americans living here and following our laws will be protected
america will be a tolerant and open society
america will also be a safe society
we will protect our borders at home
we will defeat isis overseas
we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety
we will make america rich again
we will make america safe again
we will make american great again
thank you
we're doing really well
iowa's been amazing
it's been amazing
we're doing so well and i love this place and i'm back here all the time and i'm going to be here a lot in january
you're going to be so sick of me
you'll probably say, we can't give – the caucus, just forget it
we can't stand the guy any more
no, you're going to like me and we're going to be back and we're going to do a great job for you
most importantly, we're going to get to that office and we're going to do the right thing
we're going to do the right thing
so, a few things
a lot – so much has happened
you know, when we first came out, we were all talking together
and we were talking border security, which we're just doing so great with the border security
we're going to build a wall
mexico's going to pay for the wall
we all know that
but we're going to have security
and the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they're going to come into the country they're going to be legal, they're coming in legally, and that's the way
that's the way
and it affects iowa so much
so we were talking about
so we were talking about that
we were talking about repealing obamacare
boom
it's going to be repealed
it's going to be replaced
i don't know if you've been seeing what's happening but obamacare is a total disaster
it's dying of its own weight
and by '17, meaning he'll be playing golf and i'll be working very hard
but '17 instead you're not getting the people signed up
there's been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it
obamacare's dead but we'll terminate it quicker than that
and we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better
premiums are going through the roof
deductibles are so high that unless you're close to death, you'll never going to get to use
and even then i don't think you're going to get to use it really
so, we're going to take care of that
and by the way, we have a lot of good people
we have ethanol
nobody is really – we have the ethanol – where are the ethanol people
right
i was here a month ago and i met with them all and they do a fantastic job
i toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it's so important
and it's another form of let's stay away from opec and let's stay away from that middle east stuff
it's so important
actually what i don't understand because the one guy that's doing pretty good with me in iowa is ted cruz and he's a nice guy
i mean, everything i say he agrees with me
no matter what i say
i was going to do one really wild but he agrees
but with the ethanol, really, he's got to come a long way because he's right now for the oil
but i understand it
oil pays him a lot of money
he's got to be for oil, right
the oil companies give him a lot of money
but i'm with you
i'm with everybody
look, i'm self funding
i have no oil company
i have no special interest
i have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they're representing countries that are ripping off the country, they're representing companies that are ripping off our country
all i do is i'm going to be working for you folks
we're going to do this thing together
we're going to make america so great again and maybe better than ever before
so important
so when we first started, i talked about china how they're ripping us and japan and mexico
mexico both at the border and in trade
they're taking so many of our companies
nabisco's moving there with their big plant
ford is moving there with a big plant
they took a big plant away from tennessee – a great state – they took it away at the last moment
i'm not going to let that stuff
we're going to do what we have to do, okay
but i talked about thatand i talk about it a lot
the fact is that about 2
5 weeks ago with paris, i'm speaking a little bit differently now
believe me, i can take care of china in my back pocket
that's easy for me
that's what i do
and we have all the cards
a lot of people don't know
you know, these politicians they don't understand we have the cards
you know, with china, our people pay tax
they pay no tax
it's not supposed to be that way
they call it a tariff because it sounds better
but we'll take care of that
we'll take care of all of that
what happened is with paris, there's a different mindset
and when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me
now, maybe it had to do – who knows why
who knows
but my poll numbers went up
and do you ever notice whenever there's something that i do that's proper but controversial, they'd say oh, now he's gone
that's it
that's the end
i won't go over all of the different things because maybe you'll change your minds
but they'd say, that's it
it's over
and then they'd come in, sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week
i said, they did
because i have to do what's right
i have to do what's right
and you know what
if i don't make it, i don't make it
i have a good life
we all hopefully have a good life
i have a great family, nice people, wonderful people
they love me
i think
i hope
i think
but i have a great family and i built a great business
there's such spiritthere's such spirit no matter where i go
you know, i go to dallas
we have 20,000
35,000 people in mobile, alabama
20,000 people in oklahoma
wherever we go in iowa, we have these crowds
you know this is supposed to befor like a record
it is big and yet it feels intimate
it feels good
so i changed a couple of weeks ago
when i saw paris i changed
and a big, big part of what i'm doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness
sort of interesting
you know, the slogan is make america great again and i'm adding make america great again and safe again because we don't feel safe anymore
and the problem we have now that we've never had to this extent is the power of weaponry
it's the power
it's the tremendous power
you know, 100 years ago, i would have said let's not go
i said don't go there anyway
and i said it strongly don't go
you're going to destabilize the middle east
but the fact is right now, we're going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates
and the press – look at all those cameras going all live, all – you know, nobody else has cameras like this
they can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares
look at this
and don't worry, they never pan the crowd
you know, they never
they have me
that's why i'm walking around
i figured i'll walk around maybe they'll get the crowd
they never pan the crowd
i tell them pan the crowd, they never do
i had a crowd 7,000 people last week
more
7,000 people and in a confined space
they had 3,000 people outside that couldn't get in
my wife says, darling, the speech was excellent
did you have many people there
i said what
she said, well, they never leave your face
they keep it purposely
but i'll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can't move them, right
but every time there's a protester well, i'm protesting and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there
it's true
it's true
it's true
no, i used to think they couldn't move
you know, maybe there's something with the crazy computers
you know, in the old days everything was better right
the car seats
you'd sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button
bing, bing
now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes
well, the same thing i figured with cameras
i didn't think they moved
i figured they were fixed for certain reasons
and then i saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn't believe possible
so, they're very dishonest people
what can i say
not all of them but most of them
i'll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard
the des moines register is the worst
they are the worst
the worst
no, they're very dishonest
you have some reporter named jacobs
she is the worst
she will write – so – it's such misrepresentation
and so i don't care
i mean, who cares
so i'm saying it right in their backyard
they're failing anyway
they probably won't be in business in two years
i think they're losing a fortune
i think
you know, it's funny
every time the des moines register does a poll, i always do badly
i'm only doing this so they don't sue me but i don't mind if they do
i hope they sue me because they don't have enough money to sue me
that's the good thing
but i believe and i may be wrong – in fact, i'll say i'm sure i'm wrong but it's my opinion that they don't do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people
i'll explain ityou know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket
oh, trump
oh, forget that one
forget that one
now, i don't know that they do that
do you do that, des moines register
but every time i have a des moines register poll, i do poorly
i also do poorly with the bloomberg polls
i don't know why
but we had a great poll come in – cnn last couple of days – where we're leading i think by 13 points in iowa
in iowa
and then we have another coming where we're doing well
but i think des moines register has somebody says it's coming out sometime
i'll just tell you, watch – trump disappears
i think we're going to do so well
i think we're actually going to even do better
you know, we're leading in most of the poll
we're leading in every poll
except iowa there was one poll – there was one poll, monmouth – i'd never even heard monmouth
what the hell is monmouth
what is monmouth
explain it
i don't like monmouth
you know why i don't like it
because they always treat me badly also
but i only like polls that treat me well
but we're doing so well
nationwide, we're leading every poll by tremendous
we just had one in georgia – 44%
44%
think of that
that's 44% with 15 people
i'd take 44% if we had three people
i don't think i'd take it if we had two people but i think i'd take if we had three
but 44%
cbs came out as you know, you probably saw that, new york times two days ago and we're at 35% to a small number
we're killing everybody in every poll
just one little outlier here
again, i'm sure when des moines comes out it'll be a negative because i don't believe that poll
but we are going to win
and i'll tell you what
honestly, iowa is so important to me
i could say, oh, let's not do – i am an evangelical
i am a christian
i'm a presbyterian
i'm a presbyterian
i love billy graham
franklin graham came out with the most beautiful statements
franklin graham
he was so incredible
he came out – i don't know if you all saw the statements he came out with about trumphe was so incredible
franklin graham was amazing, the son of billy graham, who was, you know, there's nobody, nobody that i've ever seen – billy graham was unbelievable
if anybody's gone to his crusades, they were incredible
but so i think we're going to do – we're doing really well with the evangelicals
and by the way and again, i do like ted cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of cuba in all fairness
it's true
not a lot come out
but i like him nevertheless
i think we're going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals
we're doing great with the tea party, leading with the tea party
and we're doing fantastic with all the young and middle
we're doing great with everybody
and so it's very important for me to win iowa
now, i could put less pressure on myself and i could say, oh, i don't care about iowa
i don't care
but i do care
i do care so much about it
that's why we're here all the time
and then the lies happened
you know, when i was using iowa, they lied so much
i said, the people of iowa can't be that stupid or the people of the country can't –
i'm trying to make a point, right
so i said, the people of the country can't be that stupid
well, they cut the country out so it's referring to iowa
i love you people
remember that
remember that
i was talking about something, and i won't even mention what i'm talking about because the guy i'm talking about and was actually a very good guy
but i will say this
we want to win iowa so bad
because if i win iowa, i think we'd run the table
i really do
i think we'd run the table
we'd go right through
because we're leading big in new hampshire – every poll
big
big in new hampshire
christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there
it's the weirdest deal i've ever seen
and you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, are you sure about that
nobody ever called us
they can't believe it
and we can get into that but it's irrelevant
but we're leading new hampshire big
we're leading in south carolina like monstrous numbers
we're leadingnevada
we're leading in texas
we're leading everywhere
we're leading big in florida
now, you have rubio – nice guy, by the way
you have rubio and he is a nice guy but you've got to vote
when people put you in a position to be a senator, you've got to go and vote
you can't be the number one person that doesn't vote in the senate
you've got to say, hey, i'm a young guy
i want to go and vote
you should stay there a little longer
he's a good guy
stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record
but i don't know
how's he doing in iowa
not too good
right
he's not doing well
how's rubio doing
not good
i mean, it seems like a two-person race right nowand it's an important race to me
so i just want to let you know it's very important
so with all of that, if we win iowa, a lot of people say we'd just go through
i think we'll win virtually every state in the union and it's over quickly
over quickly
what about the republican establishment
the establishment's got a problem, you know
it's sort of like the fighters
you know, the great champions
sometimes they'll go into the hometown of a guy they're fighting and they'll say, you know, we'd never want to get a decision
we go for the knock-out
the knock-out is the knock-out
because you get a lot of bad decisions
i know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it's a decision and they say, uh, we're in a problem and they'd lose the fight that they won
the only way they win the fight definitely – knock out
so, if we win iowa, i think we're going to win everything after that
so i think it's going to show how important iowa is
i'll pledge this to iowa
even if i lose, i'll pledge it, okay
i don't think i've ever said that in my life
if we go and win, iowa's staying right where it is in the chain
it's not moving
you know, there's a big move to move iowa into a much further back position by the establishment
folks, i win it's not happening, okay
you're staying right here because it's great
it's great
you've been paying into social security and medicare, by the way
let's put them in
because medicare does work
with both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse
we're going to take care of that
okay
but we're not going to cut your social security and we're not cutting your medicare
we're going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off
we're going to become a wealthy country again
and we're going to be able to save your social security
i can't believe this number but i read it over – who is the man that told me the number – over 6 million people – i can't believe it – are aged 112 and over are getting social securitybut i heard it
i read it
a tremendous – like 6 million people are getting social security
they're dead
meaning somebody else is picking up
the press is going to have to check it because what do i know
but can you imagine, we have 6 million – now, we know there's not 6 million, there may be one
but there's not 6 million
anybody in this room 112 or over
because if they are, i want to shake your hand
but – so 6 million over 112 years old picking up social security and that's the beginning
so there's tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse
what we're going to do is we're going to save medicare
we're going to save social security
we're not going to raise the age or we're not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing
they're all talking about doing it, and you don't have to
we're going to bring our jobs back
we're going to make our economy incredible again
my tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it's gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups
but we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated
and when that happens, you're going to see an economy that takes off
we're going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it
but we're going to get rid of it – you know, we're at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right
you know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn't even a word anybody knew and now it's like routine
so we are going to save your social security without cuts
we're going to bring the economy back
we're going to make ourselves rich again
a woman said to me in new hampshire recently, she said, mr
trump, i'm voting for you
i love you
but it's very crude when you say you're going to make our country rich again
i said, i know it's crude
it sounds bad
but many things i say are crude
it sounds bad
but we can't make our country great again unless we make our country rich again
we can't let everybody in the world rip us off
we just did a big interview with cnn just before this
and you know, hillary – was hillary missing today
what happened
she was two hours late
no, did you hear
now, i may be wrong
if i'm one minute off, they'll call me because they love hillary
they love her
you know why
i don't know why
why
i'm trying to figure it
no, i heard she was a couple of hours late
everybody left
you know what happened
she was sleeping
i'm telling you
she couldn't get out of bed
she was sleeping
she was sleeping
was right
remember, we built china
the money they took out of country, we rebuilt china
you go there, they have bridges all over the – they have bridges like the george washington bridge
maybe i shouldn't mention that particular bridge
but like bigger like the george washington bridge
only a few people got that one
that's okay
but they have bridges going up
we have rebuilt china
they've taken our jobs
they've taken our base
they've taken our manufacturing all over the place
they've taken our money
they've taken our money
not going to happen anymore folks
not going to happen anymore
not going to happen
i know the great business people
we have the greatest business people in the world
guys like carl icahn
he calls me, donald, i want to help
i want to help
the smartest people call
we're not going to use the special interest guy – a donor
we use donors to negotiate with china because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be
because again, i'm the only one that's self-funding my campaign
everybody else isn't
these guys – when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians
they will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want
that's not going to happen with me
so, social security – we're saving it
medicare – we're saving it
we're going to make our country rich
okay
thank you, sweetheart
yeah, it's called the statute of limitations, right
and you know it's a six-year year statute
maybe five but it's probably six
but it's a six-year statute
yeah, you have to look at it
look, hillary clinton – you know this story
it's a crime
she committed a crime
now, perhaps – perhaps – somebody, you know, we have to have a fair justice department and perhapswe'll have some really good attorney general that's going to say well, you know
look, we want to be fair to everybody
okay
including hillary clinton
but she committed a crime in my opinion
now, she shouldn't be allowed to run
she's being protected absolutely
i have little doubt that they're going to find anything
but they've already found it
i mean, you watch television
you have all these big scholars, these lawyers, yes, she violated section so and so
just one after another
i mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here
many laws
you mentioned general petraeus
his life was destroyed over 5% of what hillary clinton did
over nothing
so i think she's going to be their nominee definitely
the only question is whether or not she'll be allowed to run
she's being protected by the democrats
she's being protected by the president
and that's why – why do you think she's going along with these insane policies of his
okay
i mean, she goes along with everything
i don't even – honestly in all fairness to her, i don't think she believes it
but i think she's afraid he's going to say, listen, i don't like her anymore
go take care of her
i'm going to get somebody else
i'm telling you
so, the question is statute of limitations
it's a five year statute of limitations
she's got a problem
she's got a problem
in one way, she's running for her life because i know one thing, if she wins that's the end of that
right
but if she loses she could have a very serious problem
well, i said right at the beginning
we're going to build a wall that's going to be a real wall
that's going to be a real wall
it's not going to be – you see that ceiling
that ceiling is nothing compared to the wall
and we can build it and we can build it right
and it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look
it's got to be beautiful because someday they're going to name it the trump wall
i know that
it's going to happen
going to happen
and it's going to work
and walls do work
you know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago
you know they couldn't get environmental impact statements
that's just shows you
china is building in the south china sea massive military bases
right
why
they're not supposed to
they have no respect for obama or our country
they're not supposed to be doing that
and you could get them to stop just by saying we're not doing business with you anymore
their whole economy would – you don't have to go to war
it's economics
the whole country would collapse in two seconds
believe me
we have such power and we don't know it
but they're building massive – now, they had little islands
they put the biggest escavators, not caterpillars
i think they're using komatsu from japanthey have these massive escavators, and i said to a friend of mine who's chinese from china – very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so i happen to like him, okay
– i said jokingly how long did it take them to do these massive islands they're building right out of the sea
boom, those shovels go in, take out everything
how long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements
he laughed
he said, what are you kidding me
nothing
they say we will build there
about two seconds later, you have escavators digging
so we had a problem with environmental – look, i've won many environmental awards
i'm a big believer especially in clean air and clean water
i'm a big believer
just so you know
big
and i've gotten so many awards for the environment
so i understand the environment
i've won many, many awards
but when you look at how we're impinged and hurt
but the wall was stopped because they couldn't get an environmental impact statement among other things
they couldn't get an environmental impact statement
now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something
you were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake
i don't know
but they actually had people – a lot of people – people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn't get it done
you know, i said bomb the oil, right
i've been saying that for three years
now finally they started – after paris they started bombing the oil
i've been saying it for years
you know one of the reasons we didn't bomb the oil
obama didn't want to hurt the environment
now, i heard that and i thought somebody was kidding
i thought a comedian was saying it
it turned out to be true
he didn't want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere
this is the way we fight today
i'm telling you, folks, we're being led by stupid people
we're being led by stupid people
i've been saying not really bomb – i've been saying take the oil
i didn't want to go into iraq
but once we were there, i said look, we shouldn't have been there
but then when we left, we left the wrong way
first of all, we have a president who told them a date
we're going to leave on such and such a date
what was it like 18 months later
so the enemy all of sudden said, wow, ‘cause don't believe it
they don't want to be killed
okay
they don't want to be killed
so the enemy said they're going to leave on a certain date
so they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened
it's a disaster and iran is taking over iraq
so anyway, i couldn't believe it when they said that
when we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces we are sending 50 soldiers
okay, first of all, he thinks it's a good press announcement
it's not
50 soldiers – that's not a lot even though they're the elite
but those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart
they have a target on their heart
why does he have to say that for
why can't he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth
why can't he just do that
why can't he do that
those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don't even know that but everybody is looking for them and that's the way it is
we have people that don't know what they're doing
we used to have general macarthur – douglas macarthur – general george patton
i mean, these were real people
these were real people
today, we have generals that go on talk showsi saw a general the other day on a talk show
he said – and this was serious and he's a good man
they're good men
but you've got to lead these men
even the generals have to have some power over them
he said, we are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we've been in in decades
and this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us
and he said we are in the worst shape we've been in many, many decades
now, number one, he shouldn't be saying that because you're telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that
right
we shouldn't be saying it
we shouldn't be saying it
i mean, even if it's true, you don't say it
you get it fixed and you do the opposite
one thing i'm going to do i'll tell you, i'm going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful – so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us
nobody is going to mess with us
you know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing you can do
everyone is toying with us right now
it's the cheapest thing you can do
the absolute cheapest thing you can do
i'm a big second amendment person by the way
my sons are really great marksmen
they're big believers
and i'm a member of the nra but i'm not such a good shot
but they're great shots so it's one of those things
but if you think about that question
so you know there's tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets
how about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine
so the people will put three bullets in
i don't think the bad guys are going to say, well, i don't want to break the law
i'm going to go kill people today but i'm going to put three bullets in
right
these people – and you know i have arguments with them all the time and i'm a practical guy
honestly, if i didn't believe this, i couldn't say it
so in france or in california, i have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in new york
it's very hard to get
i have a license to carry
but in france or in california or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in france hundreds of people in that room – paris has the toughest gun laws in the world
france has the toughest gun laws in the world
nobody has guns
except the bad guys
so they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, over here – boom
over here – boom
so they killed 128 but many more are dying right now
they're in terrible shape in the hospitals
they just wipe the place out and they could've stayed there for longer
they wiped it out
then you had those two sleaze bags from california
the married couple
i saw the press – the young married couple that did the shooting
they're not a young married couple
they're the worst
they're sleaze
they say the young married couple
that's no young married couple
so they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people
but if somebody had guns in there – nobody had a gunhow would you have done if you had a gun
would you have been firing back a little bit
they'd been in trouble
right
they would have been in trouble
believe me
that guy
so, you know, i went to like an ivy league college and i have a lot of friends that are against guns and i argue with them
i talk to them
i said, okay, we're in paris
you have all these places and there's hundreds of people
guys walk in with guns and you have no gun
don't you think they would've been better if they had
they can't – they lose the argument but they never change their mind
so we have to fight for the second amendment
it's so simple
it's so simple
and believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they're going to have them more so than ever before
so we're going to protect the second amendment if i'm president
that i can tell you
and by the way, we're going to be saying merry christmas again
do you ever notice
and by the way, merry christmas everybody
merry christmas
and happy holiday
frankly, i have a lot of friends that aren't christian
they like christmas
everybody likes christmas
it's politically incorrect to say merry christmas
but when i'm president, merry christmas, happy holidays, enjoy yourselves, don't eat too much turkey
right
okay, so we're going to say merry christmas again folks
we're going to bring that spirit back
i really do
i like ted cruz a lot
and he's doing well
i'm doing well
i mean, it's not a contest between the two of us, just so we understand
we have to make that – but i do like him
and i would say that we would certainly have things in mind for ted, to be honest with you
i mean, he's somebody that i can certainly see that because i like him, he likes me
he actually put out a tweet tonight
he said donald trump is – i think he used the word – terrific
that's a nice word
i mean, whoever hears that
i can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me
right
so the super pacs are horrible and i had many set up for me by people i didn't know
i mean, i'd see them on television talking about – somebody named one the art of the deal pac
two young guys
they look good
i mean, i don't know
but then i got to be, you know, started going around and i see the corruption with these super pacs, with the stuff towards money
people that put the money in are dealing with the candidates
the whole thing is wrong
and i see it
i mean, bush has $125 million
think of it
$125 million
by the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn't make any difference
okay
but bush has $125 million
and honestly, he's a nice person
he is
i don't want to do that but he's a very nice person
but it's $125 million
and you'd say to yourself, people give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million
you know what's happening
but some of the super pacs are running campaigns
they're actually running the campaign
another thing and it's sort of interesting, one of the super pacs i believe has $6 million
of the $6 million – this was reported on the front page of the los angeles times – one of the candidates who's a nice person so i'm not going to mention the name
you know, when i like people i like them
i'm a very loyal person
of the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers – can you believe this
– they had $140,000 left for the campaign
that's better than being a real estate broker
i'd rather do that than sell houses
$140,000 left
that was in the newspaper
i don't know
i think i believe it
but i've seen it
i saw it with the romney campaign
guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for romney
i said what the hell is this
i mean, you give money and they get a cut
look, our laws are so corrupt
our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt
it's so horrible
so horrible
and i don't necessarily want to stop people from giving because i think that's a good thing but you have to get away from these pacs
what you have to have is people have to know who it is
so you have to open up the process
let people know
if somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like brad who raises hundreds of millions
puts a little pressure
but the concept of the pac is no good
it's no good
it's a very dangerous, terrible thing
so we will change our laws because you really have no choice
it's so out of control
it's so terrible
but the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this
there's so little money left over for the candidates, it's one of the reasons why i'm so happy i'm doing my own
we actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 pacs
the trump pac, the trump pac, the this pac
first of all, i'm sure that out of some of them they stole the money
some guy has no money
he sets up a trump something pac
nothing to do with me
sets it up
all of a sudden he's got $2 million sitting there
right
people send in money
and that guy has no money
how much of that money do you think he's going to use to do what he's supposed to be doing
that's common sense
so maybe all of it but i doubt it
so we sent legal notices to every one that we could find
we don't want their money
we said don't do it
we don't want it
and we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you
but the super pac concept is corrupt
it's terrible and it should be ended
and we're going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific
okay
thank you
well, look he's  from texas
to the best of my knowledge, there's a lot of oil in texas
right
so you know, he gets a lot of money from the oil companies and he's totally against ethanol and everything else you're talking about
and i'm not
i'm totally in favor
and you know, it's a big industry here
it's a big industry
you know, if that industry is upset, iowa's got problems
i was amazed
i was here three weeks ago with the groupthey were such amazing peopleand i learned so much about it
i was in favor of it even before
beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in iowa
and i said to myself, if ted cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in iowa
because that's very anti-iowa
i don't know how he wins in iowa
i don't know
no, but i'm totally for it
okay
thank you
i was a member of the establishment six months ago
i gave $350,000 to the rga
that's the republican governors association
i gave tremendous amounts of money away
i was like the fair haired boy
once i said i'm running, they said what
you're not supposed to run
and then what happened – i ran against all these senators and governors
and everyone said well, i don't know
my wife said if you run, you're going to win because she understands that i like people – i love people and people love me
and she said you will run but you actually have to go and run
you have to announce you're running because nobody's going to believe you're running
and so i didn't want to announce because i didn't want to like announce and things didn't work out and i'm like some of these guys where they're zero
many of them zero
and so finally i said, look, let's – we're going to do it
we have to do it
just too many things that i watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made – bergdahl – where we get bergdahl and they get five killers
we get this horrible, dirty rotten spy – horrible traitor
we get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they've wanted for nine years – the worst killers – and they're all back on the battlefield
you know, so many decisions
the iran deal
the iran deal
how bad is that
they self-inspect
okay, good
we're not building
we promise we're not building nuclear weapons
oh, okay
that's okay
and we give them $150 billion and we don't even get our prisoners back
the whole thing is crazy
so i saw this
and i said to my wife, hey, i don't know if i'll do well or not
who the hell knows
and it's a risky thing
and i've always heard if you're a very successful person you can't run for office, especially for president, and i see it all the time
and the people go after me
i don't even care at this point
i said, i have to do it
now, we're going to have to do it
and i look at it last time with romney and i didn't do it and i probably should have because he let us down
i mean, look, he let us down
that was an election – we had a failed president
four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now
it's true
and romney let us down
that last month – it was like he wasn't even campaigning
i said, why aren't you on jay leno
why aren't you on david letterman
why aren't you doing it
and he just didn't do it
so he lost the election
so i backed mccain, he lost
i backed romney, he lost
this time i said i'm doing it myself, okay
we're going to win
we're going to win
but there is an establishment out there
it's a real establishment
real people
and they're people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place
and they're people that are used to giving donations and having control
and they're people that, you know, look when they call me i'll treat them with respect but i'm not going to be doing bad things if it's bad for the country
i'm not going to let ford build a plant in mexico if i can keep it in michigan
and i'm not going to let the car companies and nabisco and all these people and all these companies – i'm all for free trade
i think it's great
i'm for it
but it's got to be smart trade
i'm not going to let them move to mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through
how does that help us, folks
i went to the best business school in the world
believe me, it doesn't help us
okay
trust me
and we're not going to make deals like that anymore
we can't
we owe $19 trillion
we can't
so the establishment is not ever probably – look, you know what
in the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they'll be saying okay, it's a good thing because they'll be beneficiaries also
but we do have a real establishment and they've never seen this happen before
a writer called up and he said recently – i told this story
i mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond
and he said, mr
trump, how does it feel
i said, how does what feel
how does it feel
what you've done has never, ever been done before
i said, what have i done
you've dominated the summer of trump
now they call it the autumn of trump
hopefully, they're going to call it the spring of trump and i want the next autumn of trump
but i said to the writer, i don't know what you're talking about
i haven't done anything ‘cause frankly if i don't win i consider this to be a total waste of time
i'll be honest with you
as much as i like being with you tonight
because we won't be able to do anything
he said, no, no
you've won even if you don't win
you've won already
i said, no, you're wrong
if i don't win, i have wasted my time
so you know, the point is that the establishment can't believe it because they've never seen it happen before
i was on the cover of time magazine four or five weeks ago and time magazine was going to pick the person of the year
everybody – even my enemies – said trump is going to win
i said, i won't win
they said, why
i won't win
just like i should have gotten the emmy for the apprentice for the first three years
i was nominated
i should have
and i said, i'll never win
i told everybody i'll never win because i'm not hollywood establishment
and with time magazine, i said – bill o'reilly, who's a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than trump, he should have won
now, i'm not saying i should have – yeah, i probably should have in all fairness – but he said nobody's done more – you know, taking over – what we've done has been amazing – all of us together not just me
it's all of us
it's all of us
from dallas and mobile and oklahoma
all of us
because the spirit
well, merkel got it
now, merkel, what did she do
she's destroyed – i mean, she's in the process of destroying germany with the migration
we have to help the people with the migration
we have to create a safe zone some place in syria
but i don't want them coming into this country
i don't want them because we don't know who they are
we don't know who they are
them with their printing press that now do the forged passports
okay
you heard about that
so we don't know
the bottom line on that – it's such an interesting question
you'll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly
but the only thing i can say is this
if i win iowa, i think it's over
i said before
because i think if i win iowa, new hampshire is amazing
people are amazing
you would love the people
they would love you
you'd love everybody
the whole country is in lovei call it the noisy majority
it's no longer a silent majority
it's the noisy majority
but if we win like i think we're going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it's not going to matter
they can't do anything
i don't care about the establishment
they can't do anything
you know, the only way they can do is if i'm a little bit short, if i'm two votes short i have a problem because i'll have to go into that convention, i'm dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they'll make their deals and they'll have all their money guys around and they'll be in the backroom making deals
but if i get the number of delegates, there's not a thing they can do
and i'll end up doing fine with the establishment
i'm such a believer in education
you know, i had an uncle who was a professor at mit who was a brilliant guyin fact, i just retweeted an article about him today
you've got to read it
okay
realdonaldtrump
you have to read it
when i see somebody like jeb – no i'll tell you one thing i respect
he didn't change his views
he knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn't change
and i respect that to a certain extent
but it's so wrong
common core is a total disaster
we have people – bureaucrats in washington – telling you how your child should be educated in iowa and new hampshire and all of the different places that we go to
it's ridiculous
and i go around and i've seen the principals
i've seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals, and i've seen some of the people and the love – even in iowa at a school – i've seen some of the love these parents give to those schools
this is real love
these are smart people
and these are people that aren't working for a paycheck
these are incredible people
remember this
our educational system is a mess
we spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we're in 28th place
and i mean like double what anybody else pays
so i want to bring education back to the local areas
you're going to have parents and you're going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because it's so important
and you're going to be very happy with it
okay
thank you
thank you
you people do it
we're backing you 100%we are backing you 100%
you're doing a phenomenal job
there should be more people like you in this country
you know, the whole grid is a disaster
right
the whole country
the infrastructure of our country is falling apart
and nobody can build like me
it's what i do
i build
i build
i'm building on – as you know – pennsylvania avenue a big tremendous hotel that i got from the government of the united states
can you believe it
during the obama administration a couple of years ago
but we had the best plan
the gsa is terrific
they're very good
actually, they're very talented people
we're under-budget and ahead of schedule
that's what we do
when you see these things where they're building a bridge and it's going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion
how about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion
and i look at it – i'm very good – i can look at a building and tell you how much it's going to cost
i say $250 million
no, sir, $3 billion
$3 billion
think somebody got rich on that one
so we're going to stop all this stuff
we're going to make our country so strong and so wonderful
and we all love it anyways
we love it
but it's so sad to see what's happening
it's so sad
and we're going to change it around
we have such a problem
and the biggest problem i have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you'd see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans – they have student loans – and they're going through nice colleges, they're good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, mr
trump, we have no jobs
we can't get jobs
so they're borrowed up to the hilt and they can't get jobs
we're going to bring our jobs back from china
we're going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs
we're going to bring our jobs back from south america
we're bringing them back from mexico
we're going to have jobs again
believe me
we're going to be manufacturers again
we're going to start making apple computers in this country
what the hell good does it do to make them in china
i want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it
so, we're going to bring our jobs back
okay
wow
thank you very much
hello
i'd like to begin by thanking the people of montana, south dakota, new mexico, new jersey, and california
we had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in
very big numbers
i'm truly honored by your support
together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is
we're only getting started and it's going to be beautiful
remember that
tonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another
our campaign received more primary votes than any gop campaign in history
no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes
this is a great feeling
that's a great feeling
this is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not obama change, but real change is possible
you've given me the honor to lead the republican party to victory this fall
we're going to do it
we're going to do it, folks
we're going to do it
i understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and i will never, ever let you down
too much work, too many people, blood, sweat, and tears
i'm never going to let you down
i will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that's what it is – it's a movement
now, recent polls have shown that i'm beating hillary clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she's made and she has made tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially
to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, i want to thank you
i want to thank you very, very much
to those who voted for someone else in either party, i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support
to all of those bernie sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms
and by the way, the terrible trade deals that bernie was so vehemently against – and he's right on that – will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible
and that's what i do
we are going to have fantastic trade deals
we're going to start making money and bringing in jobs
now, i know some people say i'm too much of a fighter
my preference is always peace, however
and i've shown that
i've shown that for a long time
i've built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved – always
my goal is always again to bring people together
but i'm forced to fight for something i really care about, i will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down
i've fought for my family
i've fought for my business
i've fought for my employees
and now i'm going to fight for you – the american people – like nobody has ever fought before
and i'm not a politician fighting
i'm me
you're going to see some real good things happen
just remember this
i'm going to be your champion
i'm going to be america's champion
because, you see, this election isn't about republican or democrat
it's about who runs this country – the special interests or the people – and i mean the american people
every election year politicians promised change
obama promised change and it didn't work out too well
and every year, they failed to deliver
why would politicians want to change a system that's totally rigged in order to keep them in power
that's what they're doing, folks
why would politicians want to change a system that's made them and their friends very, very wealthy
i beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support – the only way you could have done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic, on track to win 37 primary/caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people
after years of disappointment, there's one thing we all have learned – we can't fix the rigged system by relying on very – and i mean this so, so strongly – on the very people who rigged it
and they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently
we can't solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems
the clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves
they've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and i mean hundreds of millions of dollars
secretary clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server
something that how she's getting away with this folks nobody understands
designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk, and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her
not right
i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week, and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the clintons
i think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting
i wonder if the press would want to attend
who knows
hillary clinton turned the state department into a private hedge fund
the russians, the saudis, the chinese all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return
it's a sad day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens
i didn't need to do this
it's not easy
believe me
i didn't need to do it
but i felt i had to give back to our wonderful country, which has been so good to me and to my family
i've traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people's lives
i've visited communities in new york, new jersey, pennsylvania, connecticut, indiana, and ohio whose manufacturing jobs – they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared
an embarrassment to our country and it's horrible
i've embraced the victims of illegal immigration – moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn't have been in the country
remember it, folks
remember it
i've visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools
i've seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges, and i've compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours
it's really not to be believed
hard to imagine what's happened to our country
america is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder
we're broke
we're broke
we owe $19 trillion
going quickly to $21 trillion
our infrastructure is a disaster
our schools are failing
crime is rising
people are scared
the last thing we need is hillary clinton in the white house or an extension of the obama disaster
what a crowd
what a crowd
thank you all very much
we love our country
we love our country
but we can turn this all around
we're going to do it by putting america first
that commitment is the foundation for change that's been missing and it's been missing for a long time
it's important to understand what america first means
it means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation
it has to make us safer as a nation
this is the opposite of hillary's foreign policy, which invaded libya, destabilized iraq, unleashed isis and threw syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the middle east
and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way
better hope i'm president
on trade, america first means the american worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition – what's happening here is absolutely a disgrace
no ppp
you're right about that
so and you mean no pp
we are going – and remember this – we are only going to have great trade deals
okay
we are only going to have that
we're not going to approve as somebody just said the trans-pacific partnership, which is a disaster – a disaster – for our country
almost as bad as nafta signed by bill clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular mexico
if it's not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it
it's got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we're suffering big league and it's getting worse
on energy policy, america first means opening up america's great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration
on economic policy, america first means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the united states, substantially lowering taxes for middle class americans and businesses
likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country
on immigration policy, america first means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of american workers
whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we're going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies
the beauty of america first is that it brings us all together
every american worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges
it's got to be that way
now, the people in charge say things can't change
i'm here today to tell you that we have to change
we have no choice
we have to change
we're going to put america back to work
we're going to make our own products
we're going to put america back to work
we're going to rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame and so sad, going to take care of our african-american people that have been mistreated for so long
we're going to make you and your families safe, secure, and prosperous
prosperous again
together, we will put the american people first again
first again
we will make our communities wealthy
we will make our cities safe again
we will make our country strong again
ladies and gentlemen, we will make america great again
remember
thank you
thank you
thank you very much everybody
thank you, everybody
thank you very much
this has been a great period of time
it's been really amazing
we've gotten the nomination
we're going to have an incredible period in cleveland
we look forward to it
we've started working already on the convention
and lebron, good luck in the series because we're going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that's okay
and it's going to be very interesting to see what happens
but as you know, they're playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so i think it will be very exciting
it'll add to the excitement in cleveland and that's good
that's what we want because it's going to be an exciting period of time
we have – we've done some awfully good work
i was just informedthat we've got more votes than anybody in the history of the republican primaries and we still have i guess six or seven locations to go, states to go
and in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we've gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions – by many millions more – than anybody who's ever run
so that's a great
you know, when you think dwight eisenhower and ronald reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far
so that's something to me that's very exciting
and overall, it's just been a very exciting process
i think we're going to do very well
we have no idea what's going to happen on the democrat's side but they're certainly having difficulty
i don't like to see people having difficulty
but if anybody has to have it, let it be them
and i think it's going to be very interesting
i'm very proud to say that we've gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that's also a record
so we've broken a lot of records in terms of the voters
our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know
we're pretty much even and in some cases ahead of hillary
and i think we're going to have a very, very successful number of months
and i think it will all culminate in november and we're going to make america great
okay
so that's the way it is
i'm glad you asked the question because i have to tell you i have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets – almost $6 million
and more money is going to come in i believe over the next little while too
but i've raised almost $6 million
all of the money has been paid out and i'm going to give it to you in just a second
in fact, i brought a list just in case that question was asked
but the money has been paid out
i have been thanked by so many veterans' groups throughout the united states
one gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000
i have been thanked by so many groups – great veterans' groups
and by the way, outside you have a few people picketing
they're sent there by hillary clinton and they're picketing that the money wasn't sent
the money has all been sent
i wanted to keep it private
if we could, i wanted to keep it private because i don't think it's anybody's business if i want to send money to the vets
but i have to say this
i raised close to $6 million
it'll probably be over that amount when it's all said and done
but as of this moment, it's $5
6 million
when this started, it started with a speech in iowa when i said let's raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million
and it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again i think we can even do better than that
but i will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves
and behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves
they are calling me
they are furious because i sent people checks of a lot of money
we're going to give you the names right now, which is what you want
and instead of being like thank you very much, mr
trump or trump did a good job, everyone said, who got it
who got it
who got it
and you make me look very bad
i have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job
so i will give the names because that's what you want
right
okay
are you ready
i brought them here
it takes – because you have to vet each company
you know, much of this money was paid out fairly early
but you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups
you have to go through a process
when you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you've never heard of – charitable organizations
you have to vet it
you send people out
you do a lot of work
now, most of the money went out quite a while ago
some of it went out more recently
but all of this has gone out and i'll give you the names
are you ready
do you have your pad
and again, i really think the press – look, the media, you know my opinion of the media
it's very low
i think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people
but i think this is an example
and i just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself
i gave $1 million, but i just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did
one other thing that's important to know
zero dollars have been taken out for administration
you know, when you go to a lot of these different groups, in this case, zero dollars have been taken out for administration
so a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff
so no money – it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money
okay
so you have 22 kill and that's $200,000
and you can call these people
that was another thing
a lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call
i could tell you, i'm not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting
they'd call and these vet groups they don't get a lot of calls from the press
and maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn't know or they didn't want to talk to the press or they didn't feel comfortable
so if they didn't say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money
all certified checks
if anyone wants to see the certified checks
but rather than say why don't you – could i see a certified check
they said well, they didn't say they got the money
they all got the money
but they're not people that always talk to the press
many of them do talk to the press
many of them have – i guess you found $2 million or $2
5 million where they talked
well, the number is $5
6 million and it's going to possibly go above that because i believe some other people are coming in
ready
22kill got $200,000
now, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets
achilles international – great organization – $200,000
much of this money was paid a long time ago
american hero adventures – $100,000
americans for equal living – $100,000
america's vetdogs – the veterans' k-9 corps inc
– $75,000
amvets – $75,000
just so you understand
when i didn't do the fox debatebecause i didn't think they treated me right but actually they've been extremely fair over the last three or four months, i have to say that about fox
but when i didn't do that one event, the debate, i gave a speech
i didn't have to do this with the money for the vets but i decided to because i thought it would be a good idea
and i had some very generous people – carl icahn gave $500,000
phil ruffin gave $1 millionike perlmutter gave $1 million
we raised a lot of money
and i didn't have to do that
it would have been easier just to give the speech
and the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it, not to give money to different things because it's a lot easier actually that way
and i believe we're going to have some more coming in
some friends of mine, some more coming in
and that adds up to $5,600,000 total and we're going to have some more coming in
now, every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they're getting a final approval from the government
but every one of those has been passed
this is my check for $1 million
we have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn't ask – i didn't ask people to be here today
i could have asked every one of the group unlike hillary who asks people to stand outside and say donald trump didn't give the money
nobody gave this kind of money
so i gave $5,600,000
more is coming in
probably tops the $6 million number
i never thought we were going to raise $1 million when we started
and we end up doing almost $6 million
i have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair
a lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money
and i just want to thank all of those people
i wasn't too involved in picking the organizations other than to the marine law enforcement
they are fabulous people
they honored me last year at the waldorf astoria
i knew them
i was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn't vet them quickly
and so i gave it to the marine
and if you look at number, the marine corps law enforcement foundation is a fabulous group and i didn't have to go through a big vetting process with them
because i was going to split the $1 million check up amongstand in the end i just didn't want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups
because i wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart
i didn't want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going where did it go
who did it go to
then we said who it went to, then we said how much was it
look, when this startedi said if we could raise $1 million that would be good
and we ended up raising almost $6 million
and i'm going to have more coming in over a period of time
i'm totally accountable but i didn't want to have credit for it
actually though what i got was worse than credit because they were questioning me
and this is money
and by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand
but a lot of these groups – getting vetted by, you know, when you pay the money out, they need government documentation
they need a lot of different things
plus, we want to find out who's in the good group
i had people – teams of people – reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money
we have given to groups that are unbelievable groups
and honestly, i wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters
they are so happy
and i'm happy to do it
i didn't want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly
well, generally speaking, that's 100% true
i like scrutiny
but you know what
when i raise money – excuse me, excuse me, i've watched you on television
you're a real beauty
when i raise money for the veterans and it's a massive amount of money – find out how much hillary clinton has given to the veterans – nothing
and then i see a few guys standing out there
they don't even know what they're there for
they have no idea
they're there because hillary clinton's campaign sent them
and actually i think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with hillary clinton's campaign, which was interesting but i wasn't surprised
i don't want the credit for it but i shouldn't be lambasted
and remember this
so out of the almost $6 million that was raised not one penny did i take for administration cost
that's unheard of
how else am i going to raise the money
how else am i going to raise the money
i would have given – just so you understand
until i was criticized – so i'm the only one in the world that could raise almost $6 million for the veterans, have uniform applause by the veterans' groups, and end up being criticized by the press
yes, i made a speech and during the speech i said, let's raise a little money for the vets
it turned out to be a lot of money, not a little money
i thought if we could get to $1 million, it would be great, which it would have been
that's right
i do raise millions
no, i don't think so
no, i raised almost $6 million
some of it didn't come through
but more money is coming through than didn't come through
the number probably is going to be – when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million
i don't mind it coming from the oppositionwhat i do mind is when i raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over $5 million or close to $6
so, look, here's the story
here's the story
i think and i've been dealing with the press a long time
i think the political press is among the most dishonest people i've ever met, i have to tell you that
okay
but i think the political pressi think the political press – i see the stories and i see the way they're attached
for instance, i went down this weekend to do rolling thunder
i was invited
i didn't have anything to do with it
we had a tremendous gathering of people – thousands – i don't know how many thousands – but many thousands of people
and i joked oh, i thought we were going to go from the jefferson memorial to the –  i was joking
they said donald trump was disappointed
everybody knew i was being sarcastic and joking
they said some of them
said donald trump was very disappointed that it didn't go from jefferson to lincoln
you know, millions of people
i was joking
i said oh, i'm used to watching it
we had –  i was joking
so they put it down as serious
they know i was joking
i'll give you another example
we had a certain – same event – it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people
i don't know – 10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000
i don't know there was a lot of people
plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along
eugene washington, a man i like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there
there were many times that
and you weren't allowed to have any more people
and all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way
they were waving to me as i'm going
but wait a minute
the point is law enforcement – these people didn't allow you to have any more people
i had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had
it was all cordoned off
you weren't allowed to have any more
you weren't allowed to have any more people than that
so instead of saying trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd, they said trump was disappointed because i didn't have millions of people going from jefferson to washington
i mean, give me a break
honestly, it's dishonest reporting
well, the veterans believe me
let me tell you, the veterans why they believe
and i have group that i gave
i could have asked all these groups – he just showed up
i just saw him
but i could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made – i didn't want to do that
i'm not looking for credit
but what i don't want is when i raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from abc – he's a sleaze in my book
you're a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well
veteran
thank you, mr
trump
first of all for the record, i'm a state representative from new hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the marine corps, retired first sergeant
what i want to clarify here first of all, i would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he's concerned about veterans
that's donald trump
i met him over a year ago
i've been involved in many fundraisers
there are many scammers out there
he did the right thing by vetting these groups there
if you look at some of the groups, they're given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and they're spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips
he gave 100%
the liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation
all right
i'm a former chairman
i've been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist
stop using veterans as a political pawns
you've got a guy outsidego do a google search on his facebook
he's out there
his pictures with clinton
they are using veterans as political pawns
it must stop
donald trump is doing this with a heart
you're all focused on the way he's raising money and you're not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday
you're not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists
look at his plans on his trump website
he talks about medical cards
he talks about fixing the va
he talks about competition
i think the liberal media and i've been dealing with you a long time
you need to get your head out of your butt
focus on the real issues
thank you
what i did – i didn't ask al
i've gotten to know al a little bit primarily through new hampshire where we had great victories
but he showed up this morning because he was upset
and many of the other groups were upset
they received $100,000 in the mail
they didn't even know what it was for
it was from me
other groups received $200,000, $250,000
they didn't know what it was for
and again, upstairs i have received phones calls with people crying
i have received letters – heartfelt letters
the bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore
because why should you raise $5
6 million and i think i'll go over $6 million pretty easily
nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building
but nobody talks about that
so we raised $5
6 million
we have so many happy groups
so many happy veterans
and then i see these hillary clinton people outside
now, of course, they don't know the extent
they probably figured based on reading the press that trump didn't make, you know, didn't raise this kind of money
but we raised a lot and i'll be raising more and we'll be sending it to other people as we get along
it's a complicated process
no, it doesn'tyou know, the government sort of approves different groups for a lot of reasons
so it really does – and more than anything else, it's also speaking to other veterans
we have a circle of veterans
i don't want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesn't do good work
so it's called vetting
we vet the vets
but it's called vetting
i think it's bothersome because i love the vets and i've worked hard for the vets
and as you can see, i've given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets
and i think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest
so i don't like that
i don't like dishonesty
jeff sessions is a fantastic man
jeff sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the united states senate
jeff sessions is a person that i believe that ted cruz has the most respect for and i think ted thought that he would get an endorsement
you know, jeff sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he's been in the senate
so you know, jeff sessions is certainly somebody that i would consider
absolutely
he's a fantastic person
i think it was a very tough call
it was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby – looks so beautiful and calm
and there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous
i don't think they had a choice
i mean, probably they didn't have a choice
you have a child, a young child, at stake
you know, it's too bad there wasn't another way
i thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy
but it just takes one second
it's one second – it's not like it takes place over – well, he's going to do it 30 seconds from now
it just takes one little flick of his finger
and i will tell you they probably had no choice
i'm entirely in favor of fixing the va health care
va is one of the great catastrophes in this country what's going on
you look at what's happening in phoenix and different places throughout the country where they're catching people stealing and they don't even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line
they're dying while they wait on line
and i am in favor of if they can't get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they're going to see a doctor and the country's going to pay for it
they're going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately
we're losing thousands of people waiting on line
and the veterans administration is run by obama just as incompetently as he's running our country
you look at the tsa, you look at what's going on at the airports and you look at that
okay
just take a look at that
that's like the veterans administration
nothing in our country works anymore
it's a mess
and maybe that's why i'm doing so well in the polls
no, it doesn't have to be privatization
no, it doesn't have to be privatization
what it has to be is when somebody's on line and they say it's going to be a seven day wait, that person is going to walk over to across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of
we're going to pay the bill
and by the way, that's going to be a lot less expensive
and we'll check it out and be careful
but that's going to be a lot less expensive than what's going on
these people are living in hell
and hillary clinton said the veterans administration is working just fine
and the head of it,  mcdonald said last week that waiting in line is not bad – look at disney world
okay
these are the kind of people we have running things
it's ridiculous
that's their choice
you have a party called the democrats and they're going to have to make that choice
i think it's probably going to be her because it's rigged
and i think if you people will say i'm the one that came up with the term rigged
i used it for myself, except that i won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides
with the republicans it's less obvious
with democrats with the whole super delegate thing, it's ridiculous
so i think that they're going to have to make that determination
if you're asking me who i prefer running against
i think what she did was very bad and i think a lot of people have done a lot less than her and their lives have been destroyed
the judge has been very unfair
has not done a good job
he's been a very bad judge
has been very unfair
and i will win the trump university case
i already am as far as i'm concerned
but i will win the trump university case
because i don't care
i have a judge who's very, very unfair
well, you'll see it in court documents
but i have a judge who's very, very unfair
he knows he's unfair
and i'll win the trump university case
i can settle that case
i could have settled it
i just choose not to
in fact, when i ran this, they said why didn't you settle up that case
i don't want to settle the case
because you know what
because i'm a man of principle
and most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially
it was good
it was great
and you know what
when they're on the stand and you say how come you signed the letter saying that trump university was so good
how come you signed the letter
the woman that was the original plaintiff in the case – they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case
the case should have been dropped
the whole case should have been dropped
they wanted her dismissed from the case
you know why
because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that we'd win the case easily
she signed a letter and she's on film
she's on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about trump university
so they didn't want her anymore because she's a disaster for them
so they went to the judge and they said your honor, we'd like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case
and he said, oh, that's okay
she's the one that started the case
now, they don't even want her to testify
they don't want her to testify because she's a disaster
she has all sorts of beautiful statements about it
and importantly, she's on tape saying how great it is
they don't want her
i wouldn't want her either
now, i could have settled that case
i could settle that case
i can settle that case
i don't want to
i'll go through the process
because we're down the line
because we're down the line and the fact that you can't win as independent
for the most part, you can't even get on texas and various other states now
it's too late
but texas is out
here's what happens
what happens is you will not have – and very importantly – you will not have supreme court justices
you're going to lose
you could have as many as four or five
that's over
now,  kristol's the one that's – but he's the last one
don't forget, he said trump will never run
the guy's not a smart person
he said, donald trump would never run
remember
you remember
i actually blame you
why do you put this guy on television
i see him on the different shows
he's got no credibility
said i won't run
if i run, i won't do well
if i do well, this and that
he looks like such a fool
i saw him on one show
he's practically crying because he can't justify
now he comes out with a tweet over the weekend – over memorial day weekend – it sounds like he's going to put somebody up
even i thought it
i thought, oh, they're going to find indie
now he comes out with something saying he was almost – almost – kidding
okay
let me tell you, these people are losers
he's trying to make you – he's trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts
if they do an indie, assuming it's decent, which i don't think anybody with a reputation would do it because they'd look like fools
but what you're going to do is you lose the election for the republicans and therefore you lose the supreme court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the supreme court where this country will never ever recover
it will never, ever be the same
no, i didn't say that
i said bill kristol is a loser and i'll tell you whyhe has called every single move
take a look – on me, he's going to lose this state – i won in a landslidei didn't say everybody
many
i didn't say everybody
wait, wait, wait
bill kristol is a loser
his magazine is failing, as you know
it's going to be down – i don't think it even survives
he's getting some free publicity
but bill kristol – i've been watching this for two years
trump isn't going to run
then i go into a race, we go into new hampshire
oh, he's not going to win new hampshire
i win in a landslide
every place i went i was not going to win
but i win in a landslide
do you think maybe he doesn't like me
it's wrong
it's wrong
i didn't get 30%
my last score was 78%
i didn't get 30%
i don't know
no, no, no
here's the way i look at it
when i have somebody that's not on my side, when you know – by the way, i've gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the republican party is really well unified
we have come up
people that you would have never thought possible are now saying, i support trump
so remember that
we don't talk about that too much
but actually last week, the big story was how fast the republican party is healing because it is a healing process
it was a rough – that was a rough campaign
i can this
the real is how fast we're getting together
now, if i have a republican who's not on my side, i'm not going to be – why should i be particularly nice to that person
i'm not going to go after it like i would hillary or crazy bernie
but you know what
why should i be nice to that person if i have a person that's not going to support me
i have no obligation
politically, i may be right
i may be wrong
but that's who i am
i'm a very honest person
if somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be republican, i may choose to hit them back
not always
but i may choose to hit them back
i'm not a fan of mitt romney
mitt romney lost an election he should have won
and if you read the front page of the wall street journal about mitt romney, he looks like a fool
look, i'm not a fan of mitt romney
just so you understand
i raised a lot of money for mitt romney
i made robocalls for mitt romney
i made speeches for him
he let us down
if you read the front page of the wall street journal this weekend, mitt romney looks like a fool
now, what would i say good about mitt romney
she was not nice and i was fine, just a little bit of a jab
but she wasn't nice
and you think i'm going to change
i'm not changing, including with her
bob dole is a fan of mine
bob dole endorsed me
so don't tell me about bob dole
well, look, gary johnson, he got 1% of the vote last time
i watched that whole situation
it was pretty disgraceful
i think it's a total fringe deal
i think he's a fringe candidate if you want to know the truth
i look at him and i watch him and i watch his motions and i watch what he says
i think that he is a fringe candidatewhen you do a little research on that i think it's not going to be a factor
okay
no, not all of you
just many of you
yeah, it is
yeah, it is
let me tell you something
i'm a person – yeah, it's going to be like thisif the press writes false stories like they did with this – half of you were amazed that i raised all of this money
if the press writes false stories like they did where i wanted to keep a low profile
i didn't want the credit for raising all this money for the vets
i wasn't looking for the credit
and by the way, more money is coming in
i wasn't looking for the credit
but i had no choice but to do this because the press was saying i didn't raise any money for them
not only did i raise it, much of it was given a long time ago
and there is a vetting process and i think you understand that
but when i raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in
but when i raise $5
6 million as of today, more is coming in
and this is going to phenomenal groups
and i have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard
and then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, i'm going to continue to attack the press
look, i find the press to be extremely dishonest
i find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest
i will say that
okay, thank you all very much
thank you
thank you very much
well, thank you very much everyone
i want to start by, as always, thanking my family
my wife, melania
my kids – they're not kids anymore but they're kids as far as i'm concerned
they'll always be my kids
and i want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us
i want to thank my entire family, including maryanne, elizabeth, robert
and it's been some unbelievable day and evening and year
i never have been through anything like this but it's a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold, and we're going to make america great again
we're going to make america great again
so important – so important that the people of indiana have been incredible
i started as you know not very long ago – about six weeks ago – and i was told that i had a 20 point deficit
and i went there and i worked very hard and i campaigned and i made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people – incredible people
you don't get better, and the crowds got bigger and bigger
and toward the end, it was like i didn't want to leave
i almost said, maybe i'll just never leave and it resonated somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight
it was a tremendous victory
and i have to thank bobby knight
boy, bobby knight was incredible
he was incredible
i always that people like that – there aren't many – but it's called tough, smart, and they know how to win
and that's what our country needs
we have to win again
we have to know how to win
and we haven't won
we've been losing all the time
we lose with our military
we can't beat isis
we lose with trade
we lose with borders
we lose everything
we're not going to lose
we're going to start winning again and we're going to win big league
believe me
so when i got back tonight and i started watching all of the different networks, i could immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all 57 delegates
and i must say in staying in various places in indiana, i turned on the television and all i saw was negative ads, negative one after another after another
and i called my people and i said, how can we win
it's just constantly
it was the same as in florida
you know, there've been 60,000 negative ads
i got it right from you folks, okay
60,000
in fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000
now it's 60,000 negative ads – most of which are absolutely false and disgusting
and i said how can anybody endure this
i had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that i was watching
and i said that's just incredible
and the people are so smart
they don't buy it
they get it
and it's tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent – millions and millions of dollars
and they were comparing it
they think it was probably $8 million was spent against me and we spent $900,000
so, i mean, to me that's the way it's supposed to be
that's something that makes me feel really, really very good
and now we're going to nebraska where i have – i just hear we're doing really wonderfully
i look forward to that very much
and west virginia
and we're going to get those miners back to work
i'll tell you what
we're going to get those miners back to work
we're not going to be hillary clinton, and i watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again
let me tell you, the miners in west virginia and pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and ohio and all over, they're going to start to work again
believe me
you're going to be proud again to be miners
so we'll be going there
i must say this tremendous run that we've had started with new york when we had almost 62%
and don't forget, that's with three people
so 62% with two people is a massive landslide
but 63% almost – just a little over 62% – when you have that kind of a number with three people, it's actually unheard of
and all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it's tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers
and some of the numbers in my opinion that i got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people
i think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in new york
but we never got the credit for that
but now we don't need the credit because we're going after hillary clinton
she will not be a great president
she will not be a good president
she will be a poor president
she doesn't understand trade
her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done
it's called nafta
and i was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially
now i've known syracuse and i've known poughkeepsie and i've known all of the different places that i visited in new york and then pennsylvania and then maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible
and all of the different state – connecticut
and i've witnessed what it's done really firsthand
and it has been indeed carnage
and we're going to change it around
we're not going to let carrier and all of these companies just think they can move – go to another country, make their products, sell it back to us, and we get only one thing
we get unemployment
not going to happen anymore, folks
not going to happen anymore
we're going to bring back our jobs and we're going to keep our jobs
we're not going to let companies leave
now, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete
but when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that's not going to happen
not going to happen
and if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences
i have to tell you that i've competed all my life
competitive person
all my life i've been in competitions
different competitions whether it's sports or business or now for 10 months politics
and i have to tell you that i have met some of the most incredible competitors that i have ever competed against right here on the republican party
you know, we started off with that 17 number
and just so you understand – ted cruz – i don't know if he likes me or if he doesn't like me
but he is one hell of a competitor
he is a tough, smart guy
and he has got an amazing future
he's got an amazing future
so i want to congratulate ted
and i know how tough it is
it's tough
it's tough
i've had some moments where it's not looking so good, and it's not a great feeling
and so i understand how ted feels and heidi and their whole beautiful family
and i just want to say that one tough competitor and i can say that for the others
i mean, chris christie who endorsed me
incredible guy
ben carson who was right up there, one of the first
he just called me and said, it's a movement you've got going
we've got to do something because i'll tell you what, it's an incredible movement
and dr
ben carson endorsed me
and i want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep ben totally involved because we're going to win
we're going to win in november
and we're going to win big and it's going to be america first
you know, i made a speech the other day and i talked about how we're the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don't respect us and they don't take care of us and they don't treat us right in many cases
and that's not going to happen
now, we're going to keep things going and we're going to keep things going very nicely but we owe – soon – $21 trillion
it's $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion
and we're just not in a position that we're in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place
so, we're going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries
but likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we've been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the united states, to its people, and to its taxpayers
so that will change
and i will tell you, they're going to end up liking us better than they do right
they're going to respect us
in this building right upstairs, i have the largest bank in the world from china
the relationship is fantastic
we have great relationships with many foreign countries
but they have to respect us and they have to understand where we're coming from
and you know, it is a two-way street
and the two-way street means that we're going down one side and they're coming up the other
and we're going to meet and we are going to have something that's going to be really fabulous
now, if that can't happen
if for some reason they want this system to continue the way it's going now, which is not fair and not good, where we're spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the middle east
and we have to build our infrastructure, our roads
we have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country
we've become close to a third world country
you look at some of our airports
it's third world
and then you go to other countries and you see places like you've never seen
so i have to say that we are going to turn it around
we're going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before
it's the cheapest thing we can do
and we're going to have to take out isis and we're going to have to take them out fast
we can't allow that cancer to continue
we cannot allow it to continue
and you know, one group that's been so incredible to me are the vets – the veterans
and they've been treated so badly
so badly
and we're going to get that straightened out
now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it's happened now with two or three
but the rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, i'm now leading hillary clinton
a lot of good things
and that's going to continue because they're not going to be able to do it, folks
they're not going to be able to make great trade deals
we have such bad deals
they're not going to be able to do what we do with the military
they're not going to be able to do what we're going to do on the border, including the wall
we're going to have unbelievably great relationships with the hispanics
the hispanics have been so incredible to me
they want jobs
everybody want jobs
the african-americans want jobs
you look at what's going on
they want jobs
and we're going to bring back our jobs
we're going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again
and this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country
and we're going to love each other
we're going to cherish each other
we're going to take care of each other
and we're going to have great economic development
and we're not going to let other countries take it away from us because that's what's been happening for far too many years and we're not going to do it anymore
we're not going to do it anymore
i want to thank and congratulate the republican national committee and reince priebus, who i just spoke to
he's doing a tremendous job
it's not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now i guess he's down to one
i don't know
is there a second
i mean, is there a second
i don't know
but i have ask you folks to explain the status of that
but he's done an amazing job and i think we're going to see something really, really fantastic
i also want to thank my staff, paul, cory, pope
i mean, these people
what we've been doing has been incredible
the work has been unreal
and jared , married to my daughter ivanka
i mean, honestly, you know jared is a very successful real estate person but i actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate
i'm excited
and he's very good at politics
so again folks this has been an amazing evening
i didn't expect this
i didn't expect it
and what ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the republican party
we have to bring unity
it's so much easier if we have it
and many, many people are calling that you wouldn't even believe – the media, the press, they wouldn't believe
people who have said the worst things about me – i've never had things said about me like this
you know, with my businesses, i've always been very respected
people didn't talk to me this way
but in politics, it's easy
the worst things and they're calling now and they're calling us all and they're saying, we'd love to get on the train – the trump train they call it – but we'd love to get on the team
and i actually spoke to one today who was vicious
i mean, this guy was unbelievable
and i said, i'd love having you and i think it's terrific
but after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team
and he said, mr
trump, don't even think about it
don't worry about it
there'll be no problem
in other words, he's a politician
there's no problem
i would have had a hard time
but we have a lot of people coming – lots of congressmen
i have to thank jeff sessions – sen
jeff sessions – one of the most respected men or people in congress
and so many others
i mean, sarah palin has been from day one incredible
jerry falwell, jr
liberty university, i mean he is something
he is really a special person
they've done an incredible job and everybody goes through liberty
we all go through liberty and somehow he liked what i was saying and perhaps he liked the way i said it
but he's a special guy and he really has helped
and so many pastors and ministers
and tonight, i see that i won with the evangelicals
the evangelical vote was for trump
and there's no greater honor
no greater honor
we're going to work together for many, many years
we're going to make it so good
we're going to be saying merry christmas again
we're going to be saying it
and i won with women
i love winning with women
but i won with women
i won with men
we won with hispanics
we won with african-americans
we won with every – virtually every category
so it's just been an amazing evening
so again, i want to congratulate ted cruz
he is a tough, smart competitor
i want to thank my wife and my family
it's an incredible family
i want to thank my staff – both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we're doing currently, my staff where we're running for the presidency
and remember this
our theme is very simple
it's make america great
we will make america great again
we will start winning again
you will be so proud of this country very, very soon
thank you all
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much
so beautiful
she said, do you mind
i wrote something – coming out, i wrote something
do you mind if i said it
i said, not at all
should i read it
she said, i don't want you to read it
i don't want you to read it
thank you very much
i want to thank melania for that
that was very special
you know, wisconsin's a really special place, and we've been all over today
speeches all over
we had one before
thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an airplane hangar because the hangar was packed
and we had another one in the morning, and it's been an amazing day, and some phenomenal results
you see what's happening with the polls
boom
like a rocket ship
it's like a rocket
i guess i just heard when i walked in one just came out that we're 10 points up
but don't worry about that
pretend you didn't hear that
go out and vote tomorrow
okay
go out and vote tomorrow
you know, i always tell – i used to say this to politicians that run that'd be friends of mine, i'd say, pretend you're a little bit behind
okay
that way you'd work hard
you'd never forget
but you know, there's somebody that was – i saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman, an incredible woman, and melania just said hello and met her was so taken, and she represented you so beautifully
and some of you know who she is
many of you know who she is
but she was miss wisconsin
she has one of the most incredible spirits that i've ever seen
she's got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine
i'll tell you that's an amazing and just an incredible story and we're going to make sure that it goes as well as it can
she was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart, and we all have to speak from the heart
and you noticed no teleprompters
we don't have teleprompters
we want to do it right from here and from here and from here
but i just want to – i saw melissa, and i said, i have to have you up because her story's an amazing story and it's a story of courage and we're going to work with her family and we're going to make sure everything goes well
okay, thank you all very much
so, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, i said to a few of the folks i've got to explain what's happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by tpp, which cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy wisconsin
this trans-pacific partnership is a disaster
cruz is pushing it hard
kasich, i don't think he's a player here
i mean, the guy is one in 32
he's one and it was in his own state
and if i would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in florida, i would have won in my opinion ohio
he's one and 32
now, in all fairness, jeb bush was doing a lot better than that
many people were doing better
it's called you get out
he's taking my votes
we have to get over 50%
and how do you do that
look, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, i'm one in 32
in other words, i've won one out of 32 states, and you do what marco did, which was great, and you do what rand paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out
and she's going through a very hard time
and she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what we're all – what we're trying to do
not me
i'm a messenger
what we're trying to do – make america great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we don't win anymore
we don't win anymore
we don't win with trade
we don't win with the military
we pay for everybody else's military
we don't know what we're doing
and she saw it and she was here early
and she knows that we're going to take care of our people, and it's going to be america first
it's got to be america first
we have no choice
we have no choice
and she's with a friend of hers who's very well-known, chelsea cooley, who is a tremendous, tremendous woman and just an amazing person
also a great singer but i won't even mention that because chelsea would be the last to want to have people know that
chelsea is such a great friend of melissa young and melissa young – i just want to bring her and chelsea onto the stage and maybe melissa would like to say something and chelsea
but this is just an unbelievable woman
so could i ask melissa to come up on stage please
and by the way, if you want, you could put your name up and you say i want to run and you go to the convention and you run
but it would be nice to see – because i'll tell you what, he takes my votes away much more than he does cruz
and i don't like it
i don't think it's right
i don't think it's appropriate
but you know what
if we have to live with him, we still beat him easily
okay, folks
i mean, okay
but kasich voted for nafta
nafta was a disaster for wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country
ted cruz wants tpp and it is going to make nafta look like peanuts
what they're doing to us with those documents, and cruz is the one that insisted that we can't talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement
he wouldn't let them do it
he's the one that fought currency devaluation
that's the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs
and we can't let this go on any longer
now, they're controlled by their pacs
they're controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions
they're controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in washington
they have signs on their forehead
it's like stamped into their forehead – i take care of cruz
they're specialists
i take care of kasich
i take care of hillary
oh, hillary
ayeyeye
take care of hillary
so we can't let it happen anymore
we can't let it happen anymore
it's time – you know obama used to say, time for change
i'll say it's time for change but real change this time not that change
real change
obama yesterday – president obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the iran deal
i could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed
the ink isn't even dry and now he's finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it's only going to get worse
and by the way, iran is getting worse
they were supposed to come into the community
remember
what a bunch of babies
are we babies
are we babies
hello over there
they were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved
now, you see they just ordered 118 airbus jets
those are the big jets
100
they didn't order boeing
the reason – one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending
so we give them $150 billion and they're not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products
okay
how crazy are we
how much longer is it going to last
when are we going to get smart
when are we going to stop
we as a country are being ripped off
we are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world
okay
whether it's militarily or trade
we don't win anymore
we can't win with the military
we can't beat isis
can you imagine gen
macarthur or gen
george patton
they say get rid of isis
what do you think
it's so sad to see what's happening to our country and we're going to turn it around and we're going to change it
and we're going to make it rich again, and we're going to make it strong again
so, and so many different elements, and i've been talking about trade
i always talk about trade
because when i announced on june 16th coming down the escalator with melania, it was like the academy awards
there were so many cameras
i've never seen anything like it
so many cameras
and i took a deep breadth and i said, let's go
because we have to do it
you know, it takes guts
running for president, believe me, takes guts
it takes a lot of guts
believe me
and even for the politicians they run at least they're out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty
you see where i won louisiana and then i find out that i'm not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that i beat
what kind of stuff is that
and somebody said, well, there's a rule and another rule
i don't care about rules, folks
i go out and i campaign
we win
we win
we get the delegates
right
but in the meantime, we have millions more votes than cruz
we've beaten him in most of the states
i mean, we're just winning so much
and we're winning by almost 300 delegates
so we're doing great
and i think we close it out before the convention
i think we actually close it out before the convention
and that's like a prizefighter
you know, they go into unfriendly territory, and the champ, he goes in
and they say, what do you think
you may have an unfriendly decision
he says, no, when you knock them out, there's no unfriendly decision
if we get the delegates, we've pulled out a knock-out
and that's the way it's going to be, and i can see that happening because more and more people are calling, they want to get on board
frankly, when i looked at what happened – a friend of mine, who's a great – you know, one of my great friends, he lives right down – not very far from here
and he said, with wisconsin, you're going win
i said, well, what do you think
but i'm not seeing polls that are great
i'm a little bit down
i'm down in some
i'm a little bit down
he says, no, no, you're going to win
but you have to be there
you have to come in and you have to talk to the people
like we did this afternoon at the hangar
and he said, you're going to win
i mean, you're going to win
he's a very smart guy, i want to tell you
great guy
but he said, you've got to come in
we've been making – i've been making speeches, three today, four yesterday, three or four the other day
we're here constantly
you're going to get so sick of me
you're going to say, oh, get him the hell out of here
no, we are making so much progress and it's been so inspiring to see the people
i mean, look at even you people
you don't sit down
if you want, you can
oh, stay up
stand up
what the heck
hey, we've got plenty of time to sit down, right
we've got plenty of time
but i do appreciate that
that's a sign of affection, and it's a sign of respect, and i really do appreciate it
that's really nice
so we have to bring our country back and so many different things
with china, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year
with mexico, we will build a wall
we will have strong borders
strong borders
believe me
we have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year
the wall's going to cost $10 billion to build
and people, the politicians are saying, how can you possibly get them to pay
let me tell you something, folks
we have some good business people in this audience
when you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, that's real easy
and that's on a yearly basis the $58 billion
it's really easy
and they don't understand it
they said, how are you going to get them to pay
i said, it's so easy
and you understand it
just rely on me
okay
rely
so easy
that's so easy
and we're going to have a strong border
you know, two days ago i was greatly honored because the border patrol, the folks that do a great job, and they're told to stand back but they don't want to stand back
they want to do their job properly
they're proud people
they're incredible people
frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but we're building it anyway
okay
we're building it
believe me
but the border patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago
and i didn't ask for it
i didn't know
first time, first time they've ever done it
right
first time, they've ever done it and they gave me an endorsement
and it's so important
now, sheriff joe  from arizona
you know, i won arizona very big, and sheriff joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it
look, we have to have strong borders
we can't let the syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where they're coming from
we don't know if they're syrians
this could be the all-time great trojan horse
who knows
i have as big a heart as anybody
we want to help them
we want to build safe zones in syria
i want to get the gulf states to pay for it
the gulf states have nothing but money
we don't have money
we will run it
we will do a good job
we'll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change
we can't do it
i keep getting these requests
you know, al green – the great al green wrote the snake
how many people have heard the snake
how many people
oh, do you want to hear the snake
do you want to hear it
i mean, people love it and i love it because it says what's going to happen to us if we're not careful
and this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going – we're going to have problems
we're going to have huge problems
allowing people in from areas of the world we don't know where they come from
we don't know where their documents are
they say they don't have documents
they have no papers
no nothing
we let them in
how stupid can we be
so this is called the snake and i think it's pretty good
all right
are you ready for this
a couple of you have heard it but some of you haven't
on her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake
his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
‘oh well,' she cried, ‘i'll take you in, and i'll take care of you
' ‘take me in, oh tender woman
take me in for heaven's sake
take me in, oh tender woman,' cried the broken snake
she wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk
now she hurried home from work that night
as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been revived
‘take me in, oh tender woman
take me in for heaven's sake
take me in, oh tender woman,' sighed the broken snake
now she clutched him to her bosom
‘you're so beautiful,' she cried
‘but if i hadn't brought you in by now, heaven's sake you might have died
' now she stroke his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight
but instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite
‘take me in, oh tender woman
take me in for heaven's sake
take me in, oh tender woman,' sighed the very, very healthy snake
‘i saved you,' cried the woman, ‘and you bit me
heaven's why
you know your bite is poisonous and now i'm going to die
' ‘oh shut up, silly woman,' said the reptile with a grin
‘you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in
right
that's what's happening to our country, folks
that's what's happening to our country and we can't let it happen
we have to be smart
we have to be vigilant
we have to be strong
and if we're not, we're not going to have a country
and we need borders and we're going to have borders
and we need great trade deals and we're going to make great trade deals
and we can't let mexico and i have great respect for mexico and i respect their leaders but we can't let mexico and china and any country you want to name steal our business, steal our jobs
when you look at what's happening in wisconsin – and you see it – the reason i beat your governor and i beat him badly was i just read off the statistics
i just read – all i did, i stood up and i read statistics
you're losing jobsit's very average
it's very average
our country is less than average
okay
our country is doing so badly
and it's just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough
we have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct
we have to do what's right for our country
when the great ford motor company – great company – when they build a $2
5 billion plant in mexico, when nabisco moves its massive plant to mexico from chicago, we can't let it happen
when carrier air conditioners, as you know, they just announced they're moving to mexico
pfizer is moving to ireland
but let me just tell you
so, i watched the politicians and they have no business instincts
but more importantly, they're taken care of
you know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, donald, let me ask you a question
these politicians – are they really that dumb
i said, no, they're not actually that dumb
some are
but they're not actually that dumb
they're all taken care of by the special interests
and when you want something done, you see certain people in washington
hey, who is better than me
i mean, take a look at me
i was before june 16th, i was a part of the establishment and they will do not what's right for you but they will do what's right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the united states continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off
and a lot of times, i'll say, how can a deal be so stupidly made
these people are so stupid
they're not stupid
they're doing it for themselves
they're doing it because they want campaign contributions
they're doing it because they want money put in their pacs
they are totally controlled by the money
believe me
they are totally controlled by the money, and that's not good for our country
okay
that's not good because terrible things are happening and we're getting weaker and weaker
hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out
you look at the jobs we have
even in wisconsin, i mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, it's all so down and so gloomy and throughout the united states
and it's a disaster what's going on in our country
we're not going to have jobs left
and they do it with manipulation of currency
and they do it with guile
they do it with so many different elements that our people don't even know what's happening
our politicians in most cases don't even know what's happening
and when they do know what's happening and they let it happen, it's even worse
so i'm not taking money from anybody
i'm self-funding my campaign
and we're going to get it
we're going to get it
now, i look at this u
manufacturing – i mean, just look at this
look at these charts
i mean, you can see themthis is where we're going
you know that's not good
right
this is where we're going
there was one that i just saw
just got this
it's like incredible
look at this
this is u
manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000
look at that chart
another couple of years, there won't be any jobs
and the jobs we have now are bad jobs
these are bad jobs
these aren't good jobs
and everybody admits that
even the other side says, we agree
they're bad jobs
and the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment – it's a fictitious number
when you stop looking for a job, you're considered statistically employed
it was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy
the economy is not good
the economy is bad
we're sitting on a bubble
the banks have money
they give it to you for nothing if you're rich
if you're not rich, that's when you need the money, they don't loan it to you
so the people can't do jobs
probably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you can't get the banks to give you money
the banks are controlled by the regulators
they system that this country is run under is out of control
and we're going to change it
we're going to bring back the jobs
we're going to bring back our companies
and you know i've had such a response
and the reason i've had response is because of that and then i look at the ads today
i'm in hotel and i look at the ads and cruz makes up these ads
we're going to bring back jobs – he's using my same language
here's the problem
they don't know where to begin
they don't know where to begin
and if they did, lyin' ted, lyin', he comes up
did you ever see a guy like this
just look what he did with ben carson
ben carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and lyin' ted, remember in iowa, he said ben has left the race
he's left the race
this was on election day
it's not like two days before or the day after
during the election, he left the race
okay
and people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for ben but for ted cruz
it's pure deception
it's lying
and then there were many other things
and actually during one of the debates, marco rubio looked over and he said, you're a liar
and i said, you know, i never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it
so we now call him lyin' ted – lyin'
it's crazy
it's crazy
i mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible
and you know, i've met a lot tougher people but i've never met any human that lied as much as him
and he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support i have
i have jerry falwell jr
from liberty university
i have all of these people
i have such incredible support
and the evangelicals – he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they don't like liars and they see he lies so much
do you ever see him – he walks up and he walks in with the bible, held high
right
held high and then he starts to lie
boy, he is bad
so anyways, i don't think that you're going to fall for that
i really don't think that anybody is going to fall – he doesn't talk
he debatesi said, ted, take it easy
just talk
talk
talk
but we're doing really well
the whole thing is just working out
and i loved being here
you know, i've been here for a long time
i've been here for a long time
i'm going here – we're going to stay tomorrow
we're going to have some, i think i'm doing fox and friends tomorrow morning
i'm doing some shows tomorrow
we're going to do some shows and we're going to be around and we're going to make sure – we want to bring this home
if we can – you know, we have a movement going on, folks
and it's a movement of intelligence, actually
it's a movement of common sense
that's all it is
we're not going to let carrier make air conditioners, fire all of its people, move to mexico, make the air conditioners then come in and take the money out of the country
it's not going to happen anymore
and i'm a free trader
and they say, he's not a –  remember jeb bush
he is not a conservative
i said, what
i am a conservative
but you know what
i believe in free trade
but when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade
if you don't have smart people or if you have people like ted cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and they're controlled by the establishment
i mean, look at the establishment
this guy in his whole life didn't know what the word establishment meant
now you have all these people going because they said, oh man, trump is terrible
he doesn't want any of our money
i had one friend that came into my office – i don't think i've ever said this before
he came into my office
he wanted to give me millions of dollars
i said, i can't take your money
i don't want your money
i'm self-funding
he said, no, no, no, you've got to be kidding
he didn't even know
he thought i was kidding
he wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me
i said no, no, i don't want
anyway, he was finally convinced that i didn't want his money and he's leaving
and i said, by the way, what are you going to do now
he said, i'm going to give it to another candidate
and i said, why
they're gamblers
they have to do it
it's like almost a disease
they have to do it
it's the craziest thing
he loves me
he wants to give give me probably close to $10 million
right
i would have had the greatest super pac in the history if i would have taken all the money
and my whole life, you know, i've said this before, my whole life as a business person is this
right
it's okay
nothing wrong with it
i take
i keep taking
i take and take
but now i'm going to take for the united states
we're going to take
we're not going to be the stupid people anymore
we're not going to be the stupid people anymore
we can't be
we can't be
and with nato when they don't pay, you know, i said – i was asked a question by wolf blitzer, a very fair question about nato
now, you know, i've been a businessman
world class
i filed my business papers
they were phenomenal
everybody says great, great, great
i built a great company
very little debt
tremendous cash flow
some of the greatest assets in the world
and i tell you that only for one reason – that's the thinking we need in washington
we need some of that thinking
and wolf blitzer asked me a question on television
he said, let me just ask you about nato
now, i haven't been asked about nato a lot but i understand nato and i understand common sense, and i'm like a smart person like many of the people in this room
hopefully all of the people in this room
but he asked me about nato
i said, it's obsolete
this was my first thing
and you know what
i'm the first one
guys that study nato and good people but they study nato and they say, i don't believe it
what he just said, i never thought of it
they study it because they're so into it that they don't realize because it was really put there
you had the soviet union and now you have russia, which is different but russia is powerful so we could sort of say that's a balance
so we'll leave it
but it doesn't really cover terrorism like it's supposed to
doesn't have the right countries
i mean, many of the countries and there aren't – that you associate with terrorism
and so i said number one, it's obsolete
i said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the united states pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people
and the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes – headlines the next day – trump doesn't want nato, wants to disband nato
and that's not what i said
i said, you've got to pay your bills
and you know what
if you can't pay your bills, honestly, there should be – they've got to go because we can't do it
you know, this isn't 68 years ago
this isn't when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things
but it is interesting
some of the smartest people have said what trump said is genius
it's obsolete
and you know what
it's true
there's a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride
we can't have the free rides any more, folks
thank you
well, we need somebody with thatand it's america first, folks
it's america first
so then, as you know, north korea is a big problem
north korea is a problem
a problem that could be solved easily by china but they don't want to solve it because they want to tweak us
they're building in the south china seas a massive military fort
you know what's going on
they shouldn't be doing that
and they're taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money
how about this
we owe china $1
7 trillion
now, they take our money
they take our jobsi'm not angry at china
i'm angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen
i'm not angry with china
if you can get away with it, you do it
but they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money
they take everything
we owe them $1
7 trillion
that's sort of like a magic act
doesn't it
amazing
japan, they send cars by the millions
they come off those boats
los angeles – i was there at the docks
i looked at the biggest boats you've ever seen
biggest, greatest ships you've ever seen
the cars are pouring off the ships
we owe them $1
5 trillion
it's like, well, how does this all happen
okay
how does it happen
here's the story, folks
we're going to change our thinking
we're going to be the smart people again
we're going to be so smart
we're going to be so sharp
so a lot of people don't know we protect japan
do you know that
does anybody know
you might knowwe protect japan
we protect germany
we protect south korea
when you want a television set, who do you get it from
south korea
samsung
you get it from south korea
so we protect all and big ships they make
these are monster, monster economies
we protect them
they don't pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military apparatus that we supply
and you know what
we get that because we have people that don't know what they're doing in washington for many years
i mean, i'm not even blaming it – obama's the worst
he's the worst
the worst
i mean, when he just realizes, i mean he just realized that the iran deal is a bad deal
it just took him – realize – i said, oh, why didn't you listen to me two years ago
just two years ago if he would have listened – can you imagine
did you ever see a deal take so long
by the way, usually when a deal takes that long, it's bad automatically
i can usually tell you that
but anyway, so we protect japan
so it comes outi said, look, i would have to tell japan and i'm talking about other nations also because i have great friends from japan, i have great friends from south korea
we have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, we love protecting you
we don't want them to arm necessarily
but you know, at some point, how long are we going to do this
so we have to see them and we have to say, you've got to help us out
you know, we have this massive, massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because we're sitting on one of the worst bubbles you'll ever see
okay
believe me
we've got to straighten it out
we've got to straighten out our trade deals
we've got to straighten out our military deals
we're taking care of all these countries
so we go to japan
and here's what thei was telling the people and they said wow, that sounds good
we've got to take – you've got to take care of us
now, they'll probably say initially no
and then we leave and then they're going to say, yes
but if they don't say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk
you have to be
the problem with the iran deal was that secretary kerry was like an amateur
call him amateur night
he refused to walk
they were laughing at him in the streets of iran
they were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made
they were saying this deal is unbelievable
they were laughing at the secretary of state of this country
they were laughing at the united states saying that this deal is great
and they were dancing
remember
burning the flag dancing
when they start dancing about a deal that i'm making, when they start burning the american flag, i'm out of there
bye bye
good luck
and he just kept going back
and i kept waiting
i wanted to call him
i wanted to call him
i wanted to say, walk
because every single thing – he'd say, we would like to get this
oh, okay
you've got it
we would like to get that
you know, the persians are great negotiators
it's an unbelievable deal
but just yesterday, obama just yesterday he brought it up that he's very unhappy
i mean, think of it
think of it
$150 billion
it's the worst deal
we didn't get our prisoners back
we should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating
increase the sanctions
don't sit at the table
say you give our prisoners back or we're not starting
you leave
they'll say no
you leave
and what happens
you double up the sanctions
within 24 hours, they call you and they say, you've got your prisoners
that could have been years ago
right
so we have people that don't know what they're doing
here's the story
you need trump
you do
you need trump
you betyou do
i mean, you've got to have trump
i mean, it's sort of interesting because i see when i turn on the television, i see these ads about myself by crooked people
i see these ads and they're mostly wrong
a little bit sometimes are right but they're all negative
you know
and i'm looking, i'm watching this on television – ad after ad
in florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and i won it in a landslidedoes anybody read
does anybody watch television
you know, it's not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million – a record number in florida
they spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide – listen to this one – 55,000 negative ads on me
most of them was made up
i'll give you one good example
we have the club for growth, which is forget them
these are among the dumbest people that you'll ever meet
they come to my office
they want me to give them $1 million
a friend asked me, please see them
i said, who are they
they're club for growth
whatever that means
so they come to my office
they asked me for $1 million
i say, no, thank you
and that's it
then they write me a letter, which i posted, asking me for $1 million
i said very nicely – i'm not a bad person – i said nicely no, thank you
i mean, you can be rich but you don't have to be stupid
okay
why am i going to give them $1 million
so, what happens is all of a sudden i see their name all over the place – club for growth and they talk about, you know, different things – ridiculous things
i mean, they're the worst ads
and by the way, once was a fraudulent ad because they said, if cruz and kasich got together and you added the delegates – and they showed the delegates
right
and you add them up – and i'm over here with a lot
and they said – and they add them up and they show a graph that goes much higher than mine and it's much lower than mine
they're a fraud
and what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago
and we tweeted about it
and everybody's talking about it
and i see it last night again
they're crooked
so here's what they do
it's like a form of extortion, i guess
right
when you think of it
they come to your office
they ask for $1 million
you don't give them $1 million
they go out
they do negative ads
these are the people – you know, if these people about trump – they call it like no trump
what do they call that thing
they call it never trump
oh, you need trump so badly though
i was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against president barack hussein obama, they would have beaten him
they would have had great budgets
they would have had everything they wanted
but with himi always say, obama is the worst negotiator i've ever seen
you look at the – no, except with the republicans
he gets everything he wants
i mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted – fund obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldn't be here
he got everything he wanted
so he is the worst negotiator worldwide
we have sergeant  bergdahl
right
we get bergdahl, a traitor
no, no, think of it
this is a negotiation
we get bergdahl
and they get – what do they get
five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in gitmo, which we're not closing down by the way
okay
we're going to run it
so we get bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six – probably six – people were killed going out to try and get him back
he left
he's a traitor
so we get bergdahl, and that's what we get
and they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us
okay
we've got to stop it
we've got to stop it
so with japan, i said they got to – maybe we've got to walk
and the next day the headlines – trump doesn't want to defend japan, trump wants japan to get their nukes
okay, here's the story, folks
you have japan
japan is very concerned with north korea
you know, number one, i like the way it is now but i want them to pay a lot more money
they probably will
but if they don't, it's not so bad if they are at heads
maybe we're not supposed to get into that fight
that's a bad fight
maybe we're not supposed to
okay
okay
same thing with south korea
i mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over
we do all sorts of exercise
what are we get out of this
we have 28,000 soldiers on the line
so, we have to be taken care of
now, i'm talking as a person financially
okay
i'm also talking militarily
but i'm talking financially
we don't have a country that can do this anymore
saudi arabia, until the oil went down and now they're still making a fortune
but saudi arabia was making $1 billion a day
we protect saudi arabia
if we weren't there, saudi arabia wouldn't be there
if saudi arabia didn't have us for years protecting them, they would have been gone a long time ago as saudi arabia
somebody else would have it, probably maybe iraq because he would have come back
and by the way, speaking of that, you know, i was against going into iraq
everyone says, oh, trump is going to be very tough
i was against going into iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning
and i'm going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before
but you know what
hopefully, we never have to use it
nobody's going to tell us what to do though
we have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted
but if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense
we'd be much stronger because the middle east is a disaster
you see the great migration
it's a catastrophe
you see what's going on in germany
it's a total mess
what she has done
can you imagine
she was person of the year
i was supposed to be person of the year on time magazine
she beat me out and she destroyed germany
can you believe this
that's not good
i wonder if time magazine had that one to do over again what they'd say
i think we'll be in much better shape
well, they've treated me nice
i've been on the cover a lot
and the reason we're on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen
so here's the story
here's the story
you know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, what you've done is incredible
i said, no, no, i have to win
he said, no, no, it makes no difference
if you win, if you lose, it doesn't matter
what you've done is down in the history books
you will be cover for all time
it's incredible
i said, no, sir
no, sir
i have to win
because if i don't win, to me, i will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time
so here's the story
here's the story
we're going to take care of our second amendment
it's being chipped and chipped
we're going to get rid of common core
we're going to bring education back locally
we're going to repeal and replace obamacare, which is a total catastrophe
you're going to have great health insurance
we're going to save your social security
we're going to save your medicare
we are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again
we're going to bring back our jobs
we're not going to let our jobs go
and we're going to be able to afford – you've been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell
it's not going to happen
okay
remember that
it's not going to happen
we're going to start winning again, folks
we don't win anymore
we don't win anymore
we don't win with our military
we can't beat isis
we're going to win
we're going to knock the hell out of isis
we don't win with our vets
our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants
our vets are being treated so unfairly
they're our great people
and other people – you know, vets have endorsed me virtually unanimously and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say, you know, mr
trump, we follow closely what's going on
you're the only person that ever mentions the vets
right
and hillary clinton recently said about the vets that they're being taken care of just fine
they're not being take care of fine
they're not being taken care of
she said they're being taken care of just fine
i know the vets
nobody's spent more time with the vets that are running
and we're going to take care of our vets
okay
we are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals
i have the greatest people in the world for dealing
we use political hacks that don't know what they're doing
they're dealing against the smartest people in china, the smartest people in japan, the smartest people from all over the world, and our negotiators are political hacks and we're not using them anymore
we're using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and they're endorsing me, and i know the best ones from the not so great ones
and we're going to have great, great trade deals
we're going to have a strong border
we're going to have a real border
we're going to have a wall
mexico is paying for it
we're going to have a wall
and we're going to stop bad, bad things from happening in this country
because if you look at what's going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are pouring across the border, it's – the drugs are pouring like water
they're pouring across
you know when i won – new hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory i had
and i won new hampshire, and i wasn't expected to win it
jeb was expected to win it
and i won it in landslide
and i'd go around and i'd see the people of new hampshire, and they tell me, mr
trump, our biggest problem is heroin
i said, heroin
it doesn't make sense
you know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes
i said, heroin
it just doesn't work
it's incongruous
right
it doesn't work
but it was heroin
and i said, if i get in, we're going to stop that problem
then i said, where does it come from
they said, it comes from the southern border
they come right in
now, new hampshire rated it their number one problem
they have a tremendous problem
but many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem
we're going to stop it cold, folks
we're going to stop it cold
and the bottom line is this
look, we have a big, big day
and you're going to look back on this evening and you're going to say that was one of the great evenings of your life because we love the country
we love the country
i love you too
thank you
really do
i love the people
i love the people
you know, they say donald trump – my base is so strong
they say, donald trump can do almost anything
in fact, one person today said anything
and they interviewed a woman, i saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room i've ever been
it was very clean, and i only want clean
i don't care about the room
i want clean
but they were sitting there and they said to a woman – a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there
and they said, what would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than donald trump
she said, don't play that game
there's nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him
and i wanted to go up and i wanted to hug that television set
i wanted to – i wish i could find out who she is
but we have so many people like that
we're all like that
i mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because we're tired of stupidity
we're tired of seeing what's happening to our great country
so, here's the deal
you're going to go home and you're going to remember this
but much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and i promise you
you're going to be so proud of your country
you're going to go out and vote
you're going to be so proud of your president
but forget that
you're going to be so proud of this country again
and you're going to remember the evening because we're going to start winning again
we're going to win on trade
we're going to win with our military
we're going to knock out the isis
we're going to win
we are going to win with the military
we're going to knock out isis
we're going to knock them out
we're going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly
it's not going to happen anymore
we're going to win at the border
we're going to win with education
we're going to win with our second amendment
so many people talk to me about the second amendment
we're going to win at every single element of what we're doing
and every single thing we're going to win, win, win
and you're going to say, that was the single greatest vote that i have ever cast, and you're going to look back and you're going to be proud of yourselves and you're going to be proud of your country again
so thank you very much everybody
this is a great, great honor
thank you
get out and vote
i love you all
thank you
thank you very much
thank you
thank you
i feel so badly
outside we have 5,000 people and they can't get in
i feel badly
i want to apologize
we have speakers outside
but i want to apologize
who would have thought we have over 5,000 people cannot get in
it's an honor to be here
it's an honor to be with you
and very important
you know, we're doing really well and millions of votes ahead of cruz
millions
you know, i get a kick
i call him lyin' ted
lyin' ted cruz
he stands up – and i win as you know, you've seen it
i have been winning all of the evangelical vote
but he stands up bible high, puts it down and then he lies
you know, it's amazing to watch it
but he said, yeah, i'm the only one who can beat donald trump
i've done it time after time
and i said, wait a minute
i've won like most of the states
i think he had like 5 or 6 and i had 20 or 22
right
and i said i can't believe it
and i have millions of votes more
he says, i'm the only one that can out-vote him
and i'm saying but i have like millions of votes more
i'll tell you something so important
there is something happening
it's like a movement
it's incredible
it's a movement
and we're part of the movement
not me
i'm a messenger to be honest
i'm a messenger
and this is something that's so special and so amazing and it's on the cover of time magazine
it's on the cover of every newspaper
it's something that has maybe never happened and they're saying it's phenomenon
sometimes they say i'm a phenomenon
i'm not
the message is what we want
we want jobs
we want trade deals that are smart deals not stupid deals
and you know, wisconsin
i wrote down some notesand it's like devastating
so  walker came out today
i wrote down notes about wisconsin
look, he certainly can't endorse me after what i did to him in the race
right
but look at this
by the summer of 2015, wisconsin was facing a $2
2 billion two-year budget deficit
that's terrible
by the way, these are out of books
like this isn't trump
this is out of books
total state debt is $45 billion
now, maybe somebody is going to tell me that's wrong but again these are – $45 billion
very high
one of the higher ones
20,000 fewer people in the labor force in wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000
so your population is higher
now, i wouldn't have done this but he endorsed cruz
what am i going to do
am i going to say he's doing a great job
he's not doing a great job
you know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big harley
i love harleys
right
but the motorcycle guys like trump
they really like trump
and he doesn't look like a motorcycle guy to me
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
unemployment rate – well, they say – that can't be possible
unemployment – they have down 20%
that can't be possible
what
is it 20%
effective or regular
effective unemployment rate 20%
hey, this is out of the big book
800,000 food stamp recipients
middle class hit very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs
these are the stats
right
you know about this, right
it goes on and on
wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to mexico since nafta
now, just so you understand, kasich is running also
we forget about him
he voted for nafta
both of them want tpp
tpp – trans-pacific partnership
both of them want trans-pacific
that will make nafta look like a baby, and wisconsin will be hit so hard
but the motorcycle guys love trump
i love the disabled veterans and the veterans
we're going to take care of our veterans
you know that, right
we're going to take care of our veterans
what is it about trump that they like
i'm serious
we went to hilton head
we went to different places, and there were hundreds, hundreds of bikers out there
beautiful bikes
lots of harleys, right
lots of harleys
made in america
but beautiful, beautiful bikes
i don't know what it is but they like me
i feel good with them
i feel safe
i got out took a picture
secret service went crazy
i said, these are great people
don't worry about it
but listen, i appreciate it, fellas, i appreciate it
we're going to keep you free
i'm going to keep you free
because we're getting rid of isis
we're going to have good borders
we're going to have borders again
we're going to have borders again
so here we have something that's pretty interesting – i love you too
you lost 70,000 jobs to china
70,000 jobs
100,000 illegal immigrants living in wisconsin
taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars
look, i don't know
i don't know
so what happened with walker and i just will finish off with this – he's a nice man
he came up to my office like about a year ago before i did – you know, i've been a politician for about eight months, right
i never thought i'd be a politician
the last thing on my mind i want to be was a politician
but i built a great company
i filed papers
the company is incredible
very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the great assets in the world
and i say that not in a bragging way
i say that because that's the kind of thinking we need, folks
we can't have china ripping us off and mexico and japan and vietnam
we can't have it
we can't have it
and they are ripping us like they've never ripped anybody before
we've rebuilt china
i mean, we're rebuilding mexico
you look the other day you saw carrier moving down
carrier air conditioning
i buy those air conditioners – a lot of them
i'm not buying any more of them
but carrier air conditioning moving to mexico
ford moving to mexico
nabsico – home of the formerly wonderful oreo which we don't eat anymore
right
we don't eat it
we don't eat it
number one, it's a good – it's called an enforced diet
but you know what
look, we're losing our jobs
look at your jobs
when i see that statistic, i mean you're losing your jobs
when i went after your governor when he decided to run and i said, you know, i'm going to be nice to him
he's a nice guy
the guy came up to my office
he handed me a plaque because i supported him
what do i know
i supported him
i gave $50,000 or $100,000
that's a lot of money for a guy you've never met before
right
that's pretty good
but i like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting
you know, to a certain extent, i'd rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess
but he was fighting and i gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque
beautiful picture of something
i haven't – i never really got to read it to be honest
and i put it aside
that was it
because if we win wisconsin, it's going to be like over, pretty much over
because we're going to do great
emerson poll came out
i think i have 67%, 68% in new york compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have cruz talk about new york values, new yorkers are no good
i watched new yorkers rebuild the world trade center
i watched new yorkers dying
believe me, new yorkers are good
new yorkers are very good
but cruz said they're no good
so anyways, so i think we're going to do great in new york
we're going to do great in new jersey
chris christie endorsed me
we'll do great in new jersey
good guy
ben carson endorsed me
sarah palin endorsed me
sheriff joe from arizona
we love sheriff joe
and you know, with the evangelicals, i've had so many ministers
i've had so many pastors endorse me
and jerry falwell, jr
endorsed me
it was incredible and we've done so well with the evangelicals
i mean, christians, evangelicals, we've done so well
in fact, in south carolina, when we went to south carolina, that was going to be cruz's territory
he was going take it, except we won it in a landslide
you know that
you saw it
he was there
this guy follows me around, i'll tell you
but you were there
remember, he was going to win that in a landslide
and then i started speaking
i started talking to people, and i started saying the good and the bad and the ugly
and we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals
i've won just about i think almost every place i've won with evangelicals
and it's been an amazing time
so now i'm here to talk to the people of wisconsin
i have friends in wisconsin
i've been here before
it's an incredible place but it's a place that has problems
but you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn't have a problem
i remember when he was on the campaign trail, i was so nice to him
i said, how can i hit him
i'm not going to hit him
i'm not going to hit him
and i was so nice
i hit jeb instead, right
right
and i hit rand, rand, old rand
and i hit a lot of people and they all went down
wouldn't it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive
you know
but it's not with the mouth
it's really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain
remember the brain
i have a lot of friends
they're good with the mouth but they're not good with the brain
it all doesn't work
okay
you know, we had an interesting thing today
a poll came out – a nationwide poll
a great poll
it was trump 48%
it was an nbc poll
trump 48%
cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something
and kasich was way down
so what happened is they showed the poll
it was an nbc poll
they call it an nbc monkey poll
and it was on the today show, and it was on morning joe
morning joe held it up and he said, wow, those are great numbers
48% is pretty good
you have three people
you know
i don't get enough credit for that
i've been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and i've had like seven people
how do you get 45% when you have seven people
nobody says that
they say, he hasn't cracked 50%
how do you crack 50% when you have all these people running
so i'm at 48%
poll was good – way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide
and they showed hillary clinton – hers is very close
she's got a little problem
could happen
got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with bernie to be honest with you
she should have
her bigger problem should be with emails
we'll find out how honest our country is, right
but she's got a sort of close race
and they put her poll up and it was put up there
you know, big letters
and then they said, and donald trump is winning
that was it
they didn't put numbers up
they didn't say i'm doing great
in fact, they said, donald trump is winning, and they put some – a little slightly negative statistic in – it was like wait a minute
they put her numbers up and they didn't put my numbers up
folks, it's so unfair
the press is so dishonest
it's unbelievable
that was chuck todd
that was chuck todd this morning on the today show
they put hillary's numbers
and i'm winning by a lot and they said, donald trump is winning
you know, let's go to a new subject, okay
now, i guarantee you one thing
if i was losing or doing poorly, it'll still be up
it'll be up all morning because they don't like what's happening
i'm self-funding my campaign
i'm putting up my own money
they don't like it
ted cruz and kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries
they're getting money from the pharmaceutical companies
they're getting money from everybody
folks, you can't straighten out this mess – we're in a mess – if you can't do what you have to do
when millions of dollars are given to cruz and kasich and millions from different industries, you're not going to be able to say, well, we're going to do and go against the banking industry to do what's right for the people if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars
now, that's true with hillary also
now, she's gotten millions of dollars
but i'm the only one self-funding my campaign
i'm in for a lot of money
i in a lot of money
what is beautiful is when i was running against jeb in new hampshire
i was in for like $2 million
jeb was in for like $48 million
i was in first and he was close to last
i said, who do you want as your president
by the way, did jeb endorse anybody yet
because i haven't heard
because i think jeb probably endorsed – huh
did he endorse
it just shows you how important it is
nobody even knows
i don't even know
he'll probably – he'll endorse – just so you know
look, when you're in war, you've got to fight and you fight hard
when i fight, i win
you're going to win
you know that
you're going to win
but you know, you do pretty serious damage, right
because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people don't love you after you finish
but i just love you
i don't care about that
in fact, they're asking cruz, you know, at the debate which by the way they said i won every single debate
now i heard the other night, i want to debate trump
i've debated him 11 or 12 times
every single online poll has me winning the debates
he's an okay debater but he's a bad talker
you know, everything's so dramatic
and he waits
phony
and he waits
you know, you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three, four seconds
and then he goes again
it looks like we're in the theater
we're not in the theater
we're in the real world
so what happens – thank you
by the way, the sheriff is here and he's a great guy and his people are fantastic
thank you, sheriff
thank you
i mean, the only thing i feel so guilty about all the people outside
feel so guilty
we're going to come back
we're going to come back, come back to this area
you guys cannot come
okay
all of the ladies can come but the guys can't
but all of the people outside, we're going to take a bigger place because i feel slightly guilty
but look, we have a very serious mess on our hands
we have a very serious situation
we have a country that's not protected
we have a country that's sitting on a big fat bubble that's going to explode
in a certain way, i'd say let it do now, don't do it after i get in
three days it'll explode and they'll say it's trump's fault
okay
ayeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble
we have interest rates that are so low that if you're rich like me i can borrow money for any amount
if you're a hardworking guy with a great farm or you're a hardworking developer or businessman you can't borrow money
you can only borrow money really cheaply – think of how bad it is – you can borrow money for nothing practically if you're rich
but if you're rich, you don't need the money so you don't have to borrow it
but if you're a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you can't get it
the regulators are running the banks
dodd-frank is a disaster, by the way
it's a disaster
it's a disaster
but the biggest disasters are regulations
our rules and regulations are horrible
we're going to get rid of probably 85% of them
there are some we live with
but we've got to go back
so many people in this area have told me regulations – regulatory climate – is the worst they've ever seen
i have a friend, who's a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental
it's like a puddle and they'd consider it a lake
so we don't know what we're doing
so here's what's happening
we're going to make our country so great again
we're going to make our country so strong again
our military is going to be so amazing
we're never going to have to use it
don't forget, i didn't want to go into iraq
all these guys think that i'm a tough guy so i'm going to be so quick with the trigger
i'm not going to be quick
i was the slowest with the trigger
i didn't want the trigger
now, when obama left though, he shouldn't have left the way he did
he gave a certain date, and the enemy said, it can't be possible
nobody would be that stupid
nobody
so i actually don't think it'd hurt that much because i don't think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date – we're leaving on this date
and then he left
they said, he was serious
they pulled back
they pulled back
then you see what happened
they pulled back then they went in with fury
but how about the 50 soldiers
he sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them
what does he do
he sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that we are sending 50 soldiers in iraq, syria and these soldiers have a big target on their backs
why can't we just keep our mouths shut
why can't we be unpredictable
unpredictable
right
why can't we be unpredictable
why does he have to tell – first of all, it doesn't even sound good when you say 50 soldiers because it sounds like so small
people would say, is that good or bad
i mean, that sounds small
but then when you think about it, why do we have to say that
these are extraordinary people
these are our finest
and they're, you know, very dangerous missions
why would you tell people that we're sending them in
you just keep quiet and let them accomplish something
they are right now – who knows what's happened to them
but right now, they have a big target on their back
people that we've let go of at gitmo have now killed americans
you've seen that
you saw that yesterday
that came out yesterday
we let people go out of gitmo and they kill americans
okay
is anybody surprised at that though
would anybody be surprised
and we're keeping it open
now they're spending, you know, hundreds of millions to run it
i guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper
you'd have a lot of money left over
so we're going to get efficiency in government
but we're going to end obamacare
we're going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive
we're going to get rid of common core
we're going to bring our education local
we are going to preserve our second amendment
it's under siege
it's totally under siege
and christianity is under siege
i'll tell you, christianity is under siege
you take a look
i'm with the – i'll tell you what
i've been with so many pastors lately and jerry falwell jr
was an example – was telling me that – first of all, he told me something that you remind me so much of my father
i thought his father was a great guy
what his father did with liberty college and liberty university
and jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place
but when jerry was so strong and so great
but i was talking to – i probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and they're really under tremendous pressure because they don't want to have their tax exempt status taken away
this happened during the lyndon johnson presidency
and i said, why is it that you folks are pushed around so much
christianity
these are the pastors
these are strong people
these are really strong people
why do you allow that
why aren't you more forceful
and finally, somebody said, well, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status
i said when did that happen exactly
it was during the johnson
well, we're going to try to get rid of that
okay
because that's really terrible
we're going to try getting rid of – and i've said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great christians
we're going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of christianity, somebody that's an evangelical
you take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless
they've actually taken their right of free speech away
so i said we're going to try to get rid of that and i think we'll be very, very successful
you know, it's interesting
i said how many christians are there
because you know, we've got men, we've got women
you cut it in half, we've actually have a few more women
but we are far more christians than we have men or women
so in a way, it's the most powerful lobbyist – the biggest group of people
but they're not allowed to talk because they're petrified
you saw what was happening with the irs and what was taking place with regard to certain groups
so we are going to try and usually when i say try that means i'm going to get it done
that means i'm going to get it done
but we are going to try very hard
we are going to get that brought back and i think it's going to be very hard to counter it
because if the christians, and if the whole evangelical christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat –
you know, when i made the statement about banning muslims on a temporary basis, i took such heat
now people are saying, you know, trump is sort of right about that
now they're all going, wow because they see what's happening
and i think if i would have said it about christians, i think i would have had less opposition
that's what's happened in this country
that's what's happened in our country
and we can't let it happen
we're going to turn this country around and we're going to be the smart people
we're not going to be the dummies anymore
we're not going to be where china made last year trade deficits $505 billion
japan over $100 billion
mexico $58 billion
we're going to build a wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall
okay
recently, i was in florida and marco, who's a nice guy actually
you notice how nice they are after you've defeated them
i like everybody i defeat
but when i ran against marco, it was supposed to bewell, he started it
right
just like cruz started the last deal
he started it
but marco came after me very viciously
you know he wanted to be don rickles, right
and it didn't work
but what happened is i won by 20 points – almost 20 points – and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues
and frankly, i wish i would have left about two days earlier
i wanted to stay in florida campaign
i wish i would have devoted two more days to ohio because i almost won in ohio
i would have won in ohio but i didn't want to take a chance leaving my beautiful florida because i love florida and i wanted to win that
so if i would have left a couple of days early, i think i would have won florida the same
but i'm not going to have anything happen in wisconsin
we have to win
if we – look, we have to put these politicians in their place, folks
it's time
and believe me, you know, cruz likes to pretend he's an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor
so believe me, believe me, they're all establishment
and frankly in a way it's worse because cruz is establishment and yet he's got no relationship with the establishment
he goes and he stands on the floor of the senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these senators – look, i know
they're tough cookies
i have the best – i have one of the great people – sen
jeff sessions, who's great
nobody better than jeff
and you know, cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech – sen
jeff sessions – and then he comes out and he endorses me
but when you think of it, look, out of all of these senators, he has one supporter – lee – who's his friend
i mean, he's his friend
and by the way took him plenty time to do it
but you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished
cruz has not accomplished one thing
so he's an insider but it's almost like the man on the street because he can't get anything done
he dislikes people
he calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the speaker and you know about the speaker and he said about separately mitch mcconnell
i mean, he said some terrible things about – how do you get things done when you're calling mitch mcconnell bad names
okay
let's just say bad names
so he's sort of got the worst of all elements
he's an insider totally but he can get nothing done
okay
he can get nothing done
your new speaker – how do you like paul ryan
how do you like him
wow
i was told be nice to paul ryan because – really
well, he's the speaker
he's a nice guy
he called me the other day
he was very nice
but i'm very surprised at this statement
wow
are you all republicans
are you mostly conservatives
i always say i'm just a common sense conservative
and so, so important – common sense
and somebody told me today that somebody else – i think, walker – used my term
you know, walker used – i said, make america great again
i said, make america great again, and i copyrighted the term
and then walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying make america great again because he saw the response that i got
the difference is he didn't get any response
so then no
but we told him he can't do that
that was the first real problem i had with him
now, i said a common sense conservative and today i heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he's a common sense conservative
well, i coined the phrase a few months ago
that's what i am
i am a conservative
i'm very, very conservative on the military
i'm very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things
but – and i'm actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say he's not that conservative on trade because he doesn't believe in free trade
well, actually i do believe in free trade
but it's got to be good trade for us, right
it's got to be smart trade
it can't be where wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can't get into china but china comes in here like it's swiss cheese
that's what happens
you know, china does not obey the rules
now, i get along great with china
i made a fortune dealing with china
i have two buildings because of china
big ones in new york and one in san francisco – bank of america – that i have in partnership with a great company
and it's because of china
i sell – i have one of the big leases with one of their big banks – with the biggest bank in the world actually from china
i sell millions of millions of condos to people from china
i like china
i'm not angry china
i like them
i think their leaders are doing a great job for them
but our leaders are doing a bad job for us
same with mexico
i get along great
the hispanics
i love the hispanics
i love the hispanics
but their leaders are killing us on the border and they're killing us on trade
and i'm not angry at them
i'm angry at our country and our leadership because it's grossly incompetent and we're going to change it around and we're going to get the best and we're going to get the finest
so whatever you can do to spread the world, i'll be around
i'm going to green bay
i love their team, by the way
you talk about a great franchise
no, i love it
and you have a truly great quarterback
i don't know
he's probably endorsing somebody else but i don't care
he's still a great quarterback
tom brady's a friend of mine
he said you have a great quarterback
that's all right with me
when tom says he's a great quarterback that's pretty good
but you know, i really want to win wisconsin because if we could win wisconsin, we're going to put all of this stupidity away
we're going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and i'm talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and i mean take a look at the iran deal
how bad is that i mean, just as a deal
but many times people will say deals that the country makes, and they'll say, how can our politicians be so stupid
they're not stupid
they're being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune
okay
they get tremendous campaign contributions
they're not stupid
they're doing it for themselves
so again, i'm not doing that
i'm doing for you
i'm working for you
but just remember, they're not so stupid like you think
but when you look at the people funding cruz's campaign and kasich's campaign, and you look – don't forget – cruz said, oh the banks, the banks
you know, he's going to be robin hood
he's going to be this great guy
and then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks – citibank and goldman sachs
he borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have – a very low interest rate
almost no interest
he forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form
he just forgot
he said, oh, i forgot
i forgot
okay
so then he hits the banks
he's controlled by these people, folks
okay
i mean, what he did was absolutely wrong
but they're controlled by these people
i'm controlled by you
i'm going to do the right thing for you
okay
so remember that
q&a
22 veterans a day commit suicide
that's correct
we're going to take care of our veterans so much
look, let me tell you, they – many of them kill themselves waiting for a doctor
they can't even get to see the doctor
you know that
they end up killing themselves before they see the doctor
22 a day and a lot of people don't even believe that number
they think it's almost like an impossible number – how can it be so bad
– and it actually could be even worse than that
we are going to take care of them
from their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more – six, seven, eight days
and sometimes they'll see the doctor and the doctor says, i can't see you now
i'm going on vacation
you see the corruptness
i just left phoenix – 21,000 people
sheriff joe was there
the job he did was incredible
incredible
you know they had a little protest
right
that protest ended so quickly
he arrested three people
everyone else scattered
you know, and you have that kind of a sheriff here
you have a tough cookie here
i can tell you
i just met him and i can tell you
but you know i have a great policy plan and i've gotten a lot of credit for it and it's on donaldjtrump
com
and with the veterans when they're waiting for exorbitant time – even for a little time – they're going to go to the doctor
they're going to go to local doctors or local hospitals
many of the hospitals are dying for business
you know that they're dying
some of these hospitals are dying
they're going to get immediate treatment, immediate service, we're going to pay the bills, and we're going to save a fortune, and they're going to get great service
and everybody is in love with it
everybody loves it
and that's what's going to happen
so we're going to take care of our veterans
if we can't take care of our veterans, we can't take care of anyone
so we're going to take care of our vets
boy, do you look good though
you look good and tough
i wouldn't want to fight you
do you think i can take you in a fight
i don't think so
how about we do it right now
that would be great for television
go ahead
let me tell you this
our veterans are taken worse care of than illegal immigrants who come in our countryyou don't even have to write it down
we're going to do things about it
you know what you're saying
i've heard this so many times before with the daycare and everything else
we are going to take care of our vets
by the ways, speaking of increase, cruz and kasich want to destroy your social security, folks, okay
i want to bring money back into this country
i want to bring jobs into this country
i want to bring tremendous wealth into this country
i want to take our wealth back from china, from mexico, from all of these countries that have our wealth
they've taken them like we're a bunch of babies
and we're going to save your social security and we're going to save your medicare
they want to get rid of it
okay
remember that
i want to use not too many executive orders folks
you know, because executive orders came about more recently
nobody ever heard of an executive order
then all of a sudden obama, because he couldn't get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they're butter
so i want to do away with executive orders for the most part
but look, just do me a favor
stick with me
you're going to be okay
all right
i know, what you've said i've heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem
huge problem
and your wife not working
huge problem – she can't
so anyway, i bet you have a great wife
good wife
better believe it
we're ending common core
you're not going to be educated – your kids in wisconsin are no longer going to be educated in washington, d
by bureaucrats – many of whom – i can't say all – but many of whom don't care for your kids
they couldn't care less
they get big, fat salaries
your kids are going to be educated locally
we're terminating common core, and you will see something that's magic
and i've seen it where parents and all of these people – the uncles, the aunts – they're all on the school boards
they get professionals
they have great principals
you can't see what's going on from washington, d
many of the people never even come here
they sit behind their desk in washington
they draw big salaries
and they're telling you how to educate their kids
not going to happen that way
and i've even seen it where they keep graduates – the child graduates and those parents stay on
they love it because their child went through the system
they love it and they become so good at it
that's what's going to happen
we're one of the worst in the world in education
we're going to be one of the better ones
not necessarily – you know, i don't know that we're going to beat sweden, norway, denmark, and china
but we're going to come very close
discipline in schools
i don't think that wisconsin should have a big problem with discipline
you have a big problem with discipline
well, we have to get discipline back in the country, forget about school
we have to get discipline –
i mean, i have a case
i have a wonderful guy – campaign manager
you talk about discipline
and you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager
he's a good guy
corey
and by the way, the easiest thing – corey, you're fired
i can't do that
can't do it
so fortunately, i have a taping system
you know, very – i'm rich so i have tapes all over
so this young woman who complained, was all – she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this
i said, oh, that's horrible
and then we saw the tapes
did anybody see the tape
what did you think
right
nothing
women – what did you think
i mean, she wasn't like – her face stayed the same
if somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad – don't forget – initially she said thrown to the floor
but if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn't you start screaming or something
did you see any change in her face
it's horrible
it's horrible
honestly, it's horrible
and the best thing i could do is say – but i can't destroy a man
i'd destroy him
got a beautiful wife and children and i'm not going to destroy a man for that
and you know what
when i saw that at the tape, at first i said, oh, this is terrible
then i saw the tape
it's my tape
i'm the one that had the tape
it's on the ceiling of this incredible club in jupiter, florida, and we're all leaving and we have a press conference
right
and the press conference lasted a long time
it was like 45 minutes
so that was enough
i'm leaving with a whole big gang of people
people pushing left and right, left and right
and all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture
she grabs me or hits me on the arm
in fact, i'm like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit
but i didn't – it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me
right
like he was helping her
and did you see her fall to the ground
okay, because she talked about falling to – now after, i must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground
you know, all this
i could read it to you
does anybody want to hear it
i mean, i want to be accurate because i'd like the press to treat me
so before she knew she was on tape, she said i was jolted backwards
was she jolted backwards
i mean, if she was, her face stayed the same
i mean
i was jolted backwards
someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down
campaign managers aren't supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground
she never even came – flinched
she didn't – you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, you're whoa
right
i mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman
look at her face
it's zero
they're going to destroy a man's life
and then i have cruz saying, oh, that was a terrible thing
that was a terrible thing
let me tell you something, folks
if i win, if i lose, i didn't need to do this
i'm doing this because i just had a beautiful grandchild with ivanka
ivanka and jared – beautiful, beautiful grandchild
it's my eighth
i'm doing this all for them
i didn't need to do this
this is not so easy
and i had no idea
you know, maybe none of us did
you know, i had no idea the message was going to get across
it's a message of competence
it really is
it's a message of common sense and it's a message of competence
and i had no idea that we'd have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff mitt romney – a total stiff – who by the way he's a dope
he's not a smart person
i'll tell you right now
let me tell you about mitt romney
that was an election he should have won and he lost
and he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what
that's an election that should have been won
and i'll tell you what
i helped john mccain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing
but he lost
and i helped mitt romney a lot and he lost
and i said, this time, we're going to do it ourselves
we're going to win
we're going to win
so just remember that
we're going to win because of wisconsin, i hope
right
she's so smart
i don't want them to know
i don't want to tell putin what i'm thinking
she's so smart
what you just saidwhat about ukraine
don't worry about ukraine
ukraine is going to be fine
just don't ask me why
you know, this world of politics – mr
trump, you said - don't forget i'm the one that said take the oil
i was right
they didn't take the oil
you know who has the oil right now
isis has the oil
you know, that libya – isis has all that oil from gaddafi, all of that big oil from gaddafi
he took it
we're like a bunch of dummies
why aren't we embargoing
why aren't we creating a nice big circle so they can't get the oil out
why aren't we taking that oil back
look, look, look, i'm the one that says though i don't want to say everything
if i win, i have a good chance of winning
i'm the frontrunner by a lot
i want to go in there
i want to knock the hell out of isis
i don't want to tell all
i really mean this
i don't want to tell everybody in this room – and look at all the cameras that are going now – i don't want to tell the world what i'm going to do because they're watching
just let me do it folks
i will do it
you would be so happy
you don't have to know the details
okay
let me do it
you know, i used the word before
we have to be a little bit unpredictable
we can't say, well, we're going and attack on march 14th and then we're going to hit them from the front and then we're going to hit them from the back
you know, obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities
he said, we're going in next week
look, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust – there has to be some trust
right
do you trust
we've got to stop the stupid
that's why i really think your question is so great – i don't want to hear how you're going to do it, mr
trump
just do it
i'll do it
okay
i love that
that woman
that woman
thank you, honey
thank you
okay
i can see why
woman
thank you
you have been – i just want to say thank you
you saved me in so many ways
in recent years, i've been struggling with an incurable illness and i'm on home care now
it's caused by a doctor's medical negligence
and in those dark days fighting – right now all the tubes have been removed and i have a do not resuscitate order and i have a seven-year-old son – in those days in the hospital, i received from you a handwritten letter that said, to the bravest woman i know
i remember that
i remember that
such a wonderful, beautiful woman
i mean, just an amazing woman
and are you coming along okay
woman
no, sir
but that's okay because i'm here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream
and i wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations, my son who's mexican-american, seven-years-old, through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in 2005 the outpouring of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college
that's great
and you know what we'll do
we're going to watch him
you're going to watch him
we're going to be watching your boy
okay
but you're going to be hopefully around
you're not going to have to have anybody watching
you're going to hopefully be around
those doctors are going to be so wrong
but we'll be helping you
woman
so we thank you
god bless you
and just, you know, he's a mexican-american, and you because of your efforts have sent him to college
and i have been writing letters to him for when i'm in heaven to tell him that what you've done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us
that's so nice
thank you
i have to go down and say hello
is that okay
very sad but i think it's going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that
you watch
but it sort of tells me when i first said this people would say, oh, it will cost a lot
forgetting about the campaign
that's peanuts by comparison
you know, i've spent tens of millions of dollars
but the big thing – i lost certain businesses and i owned the miss universe pageant
i bought it very inexpensively many years ago – 15 years ago – and because of the fact that they thought i was against this woman or that one, i had a hard time with television
now, the good news is i sold it for a wonderful – i was very happy with that
but i didn't want to sell it
but i sold it and i built it to really a great company
we did a great job with that company – miss universe, miss usa, miss teen usa
but other businesses – i sort of – like the shirts and the ties with macy's
macy's was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties
who care
i mean, that's not a big deal
but i'm doing something – nobody is giving up what i'm giving
i mean, when cruz runs, he runs
if he wins, great
if he loses, great
you know, it's him
he's a politician
they just – they run, they win, they lose, who knows
but these guys run for office
that's all they do
i've always heard that if you're a very successful person, you can't run for office, especially for president
you just can't run for president, and i can see it
i have so much false press about me
things that are so false
you know, i saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me
56,000
in fact, in florida, i own doral and in florida we had the tournament there two weeks
adam scott – the great adam scott – the great golfer
he was winning
and in between shots, i told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about trump
negative, horrible, negative commercials
mostly false
mostly
not all false
but mostly false, i have to be honest
but it came out the other day, i think it said $68 million, 55,000 negative ads
negative ads
and when i was running in florida, i said how is it possible to win
i mean, with all of this because i knew it
you couldn't turn on in florida where i was you couldn't turn on the television without seeing trump commercials
sometimes four or five in a row
and they were horrendous
done by very, very bad people
very bad, evil people
and i said, how it is possible to win
and god helped me
honestly
because i won in a landslide
i won by almost 20%
and now they're doing it here
club for growth
it's a crooked outfit
look, club for growth – you ever hear this
club for growth – a friend of mine, he's a conservative guy
he goes would you do me a favor
see club for growth
i said, what's club for growth
he said, they want to talk to you
i said, all right
send them up
he's a friend
he's a good guy
and now i'm in politics so i have to see people i wouldn't normally
so club for growth, they come up to my office
this guy was i think a former congressman
and he tells me a little bit about club for growth and i'm falling asleep
and then he goes, $1 million
and i said, $1 million for what
i don't even know you
i've never met you
i said, do me a favor
i'm trying to be nice and i said, go back and write me a little note if you can
and he was stupid enough to write me a note
he writes me a letter asking for $1 million
i let him know that i'm not interested
you could be rich
i'd rather take a million and throw it all over this room
i'd rather give it to you, to your boy
they write me a letter
it's like extortion
they asked me for a $1 million
i said no nicely
and then they're doing ads all over wisconsin
club for growth
they did it all over florida
club for growth
about eminent domain
by the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn't have highways, you wouldn't have hospitals, you wouldn't have bridges
you need eminent domain
if something's in your way and you're building a highway, if you're producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone's property, every once in a while
you know, it's funny
these guys all want the keystone pipeline
right
everyone
conservatives
conservatives want the keystone pipeline
i like the keystone pipeline too
but they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn't go 15 feet
they wouldn't be able to build it
so, they don't want eminent domain
they do commercials about eminent domain
they love the keystone pipeline, and the whole keystone pipeline is based around eminent domain because you've got to go from canada, where cruz was born, to texas, where he's representing
think of it
this guy – and don't forget that
remember what i said
i'm going to win
just remember what i said
i'm going to win
and i thank you
i'm going to win
but remember this
if for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing – remember, i'm a good prognosticator, i'm a good predictor – the first thing that's going to happen is the democrats are going to sue ted cruz
he was born in canada
he lived there for four years
the head of the harvard law school, one of the top people in the business in terms of constitution, is saying that, you know, he's wrong
and we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that
remember this
if cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn't get – because it's all establishment
you know, if i go into that whole mess of the convention, i'm not the establishment
i don't take their money
i don't hire their people
i don't do any of that stuff
okay
so you have a disadvantage
but if cruz wins, remember what i said
just remember
again, he's not going to win
but if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the democrats that he doesn't have the right to be president
and i think they're right because he wasn't born on our soil
he wasn't born
he's not a natural born citizen
he's not a natural born citizen
i don't like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody
he is not a natural born citizen
so if for some reason he should get the nomination, i really believe you're wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you're going to have somebody that's going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit
again, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a canadian citizen joint with u
until 14 or 15 months ago
did anyone know that
so he was a senator from texas, only because of the great sarah palin by the way, without sarah palin, he could have never won that election
it was a fluke
but he was a senator from texas
he lived – he was a joint citizen
now, he finally gave up his citizenship to canada like 16 months ago
he said, oh, i didn't know i was a citizen of canada also
just like he didn't know that goldman sachs and citibank gave him money
i mean, this guy is – you just have to study him, folks
look, again, i'm doing this
we're going to win
we're going to turn this country around
we're going to make america great again
we're going to win a lot
but you have to know the facts
i love you all
i love you all
thank you
thank you
thank you very much
thank you
get out there and vote
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you very much everybody
this was an amazing evening
this was a great evening
they just announced north carolina
i don't know if they've even announced illinois yet but we're leading by a lot so i think they're going to announce it
florida was so amazing
and i want to thank our friends
northern marianas islands have been so incredible, and we picked up nine delegates this morning
i heard very early in the morning – nine delegates
that's a lot
and i just wanted to thank the governor, ralph torres, great guy, chairman  ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day
that i can tell you
many things have been happening over the last short period of time
cnn was very nice
they came up with a poll
the poll said 49% to 14% and 15%
we just had one from the economist just came out – 53%
and it was sort of interesting because i was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators, who i'm not particularly fond of but these are minor details, said but donald trump doesn't get over 50% because i'm at 43%, 45%
actually now according to the economist, i'm at 53%
and i have to explain to these people they don't understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it
when i don't get over 50%, we have four people
right
we have four people
do you understand that
so when i get 53% – and this one is an example, i had 53% and that's with four people
that's an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%
so someday, someday they're going to understand, someday when we take it all, they'll understand
but it is really ridiculous
i want to thank my family
my boy, eric and don
they've been working so hard
ivanka and jared have been amazing
ivanka's home right now
in about two minutes, i'll call her
she's about to have a baby so i don't know
we've been thinking about that now for a little while but ivanka has been so helpful and jared has been amazing and it's been just great
i want to thank barron for putting up with the fact that i never see him anymore
and i want to thank barron
i never see my barron and it's his birthday on sunday so we're very happy about that
so it's a little tough
you know, we're going away and he goes, when are you going to be come home, daddy
when are you coming home
i said, well, in about two and a half weeks
it's been pretty tough
you're traveling all over the place
it's really amazing
yesterday i went up to ohio
i went up to youngstown
we had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country
we have so, so many great people
we will someday in the not so distant future if i win – otherwise it's not going to happen i have to be honest with you
but apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the united states, not in china, vietnam and all of –
and we're not going to be losing our companies
you know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it's carrier air conditioning, whether it's ford, whether it's eaton
i was in cleveland and eaton corp
they're leaving and so many companies are leaving
and frankly, i'm disgusted with it and i'm tired of seeing it and there's no reason for it
it's just gross incompetence at the highest level
we should not allow it to happen
pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they're going to ireland
and there's so many more
you have corporate inversions
you have people who can't get their money back into the country because the politicians can't get along
they can't make a deal
everybody agrees – democrat and republican – everybody agrees the money should come backtrillion dollars outside of this country
everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven't been able to make a deal
and we could make a deal
there's an example of something that you could do if i sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you're doing because everybody wants to do it
and companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we're going to lower by the way
but companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that's their money because there's no way of bringing it in
so, we've got a long way to go
but i think at some point it's going to get done
this has been very exciting, this whole process
we started, i was one of 17 people – senators, governors
i've had such great support
ben carson the other day endorsed us
great guy
great guy
wonderful man
and chris christie endorsed us
that was so incredible
and today pam bondi came up and endorsed us
she was great
she is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she's done in florida is incredible
you know, so many – we've had such incredible support
paul ryan called me the other day – tremendous call
i spoke with mitch mcconnell today
we had a great conversation
the fact is we have to bring our party together
we have to bring it together
we have something happening that actually makes the republican party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world
everybody's writing about it all over europe, all over the world they're talking about it
millions of people are coming in to vote
this was an example of it today
many, many more people
i'm looking at the polling booths
i'm looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it's up
and the lines are four, five, six blocks long
and the woman – one woman was there for 40 years
she's been working the polls
and she said, we'd have two people here
we'd have three people
now look at the line
and the line looked like it was, you know, long
it was really long
five deep and long
and it's just a different thing
we have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are democrats are coming in, independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before
it's an incredible thing
i want to pay my respects by the way to todd palin, sarah's husband
sarah was here
she was incredible
she was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her
and what happened is he was in a very bad accident
he's tough as nails
he's going to be fine
but i just wanted to pay my respects by the way to todd
so, our theme when we started and melania and i came down
yeah, sit down everybody
please
i mean, this is mar-a-lago
we give you seats
you don't have to stand
i'm looking at all these people
cory, good job, cory
good job
and hope and our whole squad
right
so when this began, melania and i and i said, got to do it
and she was so supportive and she's been so supportive
it's been amazing
and we have to do it
we came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders
and what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were – we shot right up
i shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail
we went up in june
most people said i'll never run
he's just going to have fun
he's having a good time
this isn't necessarily – i mean, i'm having a good time
you know, i'm having a very nice time
but you know what
i'm working very hard and there is great anger
believe me
there is great anger
one of the broadcasters was saying, is there anger
and i saidi was supposed to say, no, there's not
we love the way things are working
we love the deal you made with iran
it's wonderful
you give them $150 billion
we get nothing
we love all the deals
the trade deals are wonderful
you lose $500 billion a year with china
we lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance
it's a total imbalance
we don't make good deals anymore
we don't win anymore
as a country, we don't win anymore
and they asked, is there anger from your people
they're not angry people but they want to see the country properly run
they want to see borders
they want to see good health care
they want to see things properly taken care of
they want our military rebuilt
our military is in a very bad state
they want it rebuilt
very, very importantly, and they want the second amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that's going to happen
and you know what they want so badly
they want our veterans taken care of
our veterans are treated so badly
so, we started and something happened called paris
paris happened and paris was a disaster
that was – there have been many disasters
but it was paris
and then we had a case in los angeles where it was in california where the 14 young people were killed
and it just goes on and on and on
and what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals
we're going to make the best trade deals you've ever seen
we've got such endorsements from carl icahn and the smartest people in business
and these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they're the best in the world
we have the best business people in the world
we're going to have such great deals
we're going to do so good with trade
we're going to do so good on the border
but it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple
we need protection in our country and that's going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up
and i'm just very proud to be a part of this
i think we're going to go
we're going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but i think we're going to have a great victory
and i think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again
this country is going to start winning again
we don't win anymore
we don't win with our military
we can't beat isis
we're going to knock the hell out of them
we don't win at trade – china, everybody, japan, mexico, vietnam, india, name the country
anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us
we don't win at trade
we're going to win at trade
we're going to make our country rich again
we're going to make our country great again
and we need the rich in order to make the great, i'm sorry to tell you
so, i'm going forward
we had a fantastic evening
i would have never thought this could have happened
i guess we're waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also
but to win the states that we've won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, florida
to win by that kind of a number is incredible
it's record-setting
and i have to say that number one, i want to congratulate marco rubio on having run a really tough campaign
he's tough
he's smart
and he's got a great future
he's got a great future
but i have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that i have
record, record, record
by the way, mostly false
i wouldn't say 100% but about 90%
mostly false, vicious, horrible
they said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million
it added up to over $40 million
and you explain it to me because i can't – my numbers went up
i don't understand it
nobody understands it
my numbers went up
i mean, it's been an interesting experience
last week, adam scott won at the trump national doral
won the big tournament, the world championship of golf
and adam, who's a great guy – i guess a lot of you folks saw that – but i'm watchingwe have television screens all over
we're down at this gorgeous green at doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on
the worst commercial and i'm with these wonderful people from cadillac and all these top executives, and i'm saying, look over there
look
don't watch it
don't
you don't want to watch it
i'm saying, isn't the grass beautiful
look
look
don't watch
and they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal
and then adam comes in
he's this handsome kid from australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament
he's a great champion
and we're giving the award
and just before we break for a commercial, we'll be right back with our great champion from australia, adam scott and here's the commercial and i said, no
and it was two of them – two of them
oh, what a day that was
what a disaster
what a disaster
unbelievable
so again, i just want to congratulate everybody
this is a really interesting process
it's an amazing process
it's very tough
but it is – by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there's nothing like it
lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people
it's true
some are nice
some are nice
some really disgusting people back there
and i just want to say we're going to go forward and we're going to win
but more importantly, we're going to win for the country
we're going to win, win, win, and we're not stopping
we're going to have great victories for our country
thank you very much everybody
thank you
so it's so important
you getting out to vote
it's just so important because our country has been taken away from us
it's going so fast
and you know, you're talking about second amendment because i was asking with randy and a lot of people, i was talking to some of the people before, what would you like me to focus on
and they said, just second amendment
second amendment
now, the second amendment means a lot of other things toothe second amendment in under siege
you know that
you know that very well
we lost a great supreme court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation
and all of a sudden if somebody gets in that's the wrong person, they'll take away that second amendment so fast your head will spin
you see bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the second amendment
hillary is a disaster on the second amendment
no, they want to take it away
so, it's just not going to happen
it's not going to happen
but we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great second amendment person
i just heard coming up, you know, the senators
we've been very disappointed
i'm a republican
many of you are republicans
but we're not being protected whether it's a budget
you saw the budget that was approved a month ago
it was approved by the republicans
they gave it away
they gave obama everything
so obama wants to put in a supreme court judge
he said he wants – he's going to be a very negative person to guns because that's the way it is, okay
believe me, that will be the way it is
and basically they don't have the right to do that
but i keep saying, well, are the republicans going to fail or are they going to crack
what's going to happen
and coming up today, i hear, well, there could be a way of obama pushing it through
here we go, right
here we go
same thing you heard with obamacare
it's going to be defeated
it's going to be repealed
we're going to repeal and replace obamacare
believe me
but – i mean, look what's going on with your premiums
35%, 45%, 55% up
your deductible is so high
i mean, you've got to see that truck right there
you've got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it
so, i come up and i'm hearing that obama now who said by the way yesterday, donald trump will not be the president
he will not be
no, it's a compliment
look, he's been perhaps the worst president in the history of the united states
so it's a compliment
but he was all over the place yesterday
said, donald trump will not be –  i think we have maybe a little surprise in store, and we start right here in south carolina
you know, new hampshire was so amazing
we had a big, big victory in new hampshire
amazing people
and then we come down here and i said, you know, i think we have an ever bigger lead over here
and the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak
even this
i know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and he's a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people
you have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and i won't forget it
believe me, i'm not going to forget it
i'm not going to forget it
so i hear that they're talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the second amendment and a judge that – and this is one of many
this is one of many but a judge that doesn't want to do a number on the guns and that doesn't know how important it is
we're just not going to let it happen
okay
it's not going happen
and if we elected, we know that
but we have 9 months, 10 months to go
we have to have the republicans hold fast because i'm just hearing these little cracks, saying well, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe
it's not the way it's supposed to be
now, it's possible that they'll have their wish because if they win, they're going to be having their choice
but if they don't win, we're going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe supreme court judges
this was not supposed to be one in question
this was a very sad circumstance that happened with – i mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance
but now we're going to see what happens
i will only tell you this
we are doing well
we have a really good chance to win
if we can win in south carolina, we're going to go – i mean, we could very well run the table
i don't know if you saw – i guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in nevada
it's going to be phenomenal
the relationship there to the peoplebush is 1% in nevada
this guy – why doesn't he just give up, just go home
go home
go home to mom
got to go home to mommy
you know, bush is only at 1% in nevada
a couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%
i'm at like 40% something – 48%
so i think we're going to do well
then i think we have the sec
we're going to have the sec, which is going to be i think amazing
but really now we're starting
new hampshire could not have been better
they gave us a tremendous send-off
they really started us on our way
and we did well in iowa
i mean, some votes were stolen from ben carson, which by the way was a disgrace
what cruz – what this guy cruz did with ben carson was an absolute disgrace
what he did was – he stole
it's theft
and then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as i'm concerned
and what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace
so we're not going to let that stuff happen anymore
i mean, we're not going to let it
we will not let it happen
we're all watching
you're all watching
keep your eyes wide open
these politicians – here's a guy, he raises the bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to carson and he does other things
very bad
so politicians are bad people
boy, they are bad
would you believe it
so we're not going to let it happen and we're going to get in thereso saturday
go out and vote
this is going to be the place that's really going to make it
and honestly, i've been watching all the pundits
now, the bad news is they're always wrong
they all said i'm not running and i ran
well, how is he going to do
he's just doing this for fun
i'm not doing this for fun
believe me, i love this location but i know i can be someplace else
okay
i could be someplace else right now
i could be very happy
but i'm doing it because you know the expression and i see all the hats in the audience – make america great again
we are going to make america so
we are going to win again
you know, we don't win very much
you're very smart, tough people
you like to win
right
this guy over here
you like to win
and we don't win anymore
we used to win
we don't win anymore
well, we're going to start winning again
we're going to start winning again
so, second amendment protected
common core
we're going to end common core
we're bringing your education locally
it's going to be fabulous
i don't know if you know or if you've heard me say we have the absolute worst – we spend number one in the world on education
right
number one per pupil in the world
there is no second place because we're so high, so much – you have china, you have norway, you have denmark, you have sweden
you have these countries are the best in terms of education and they're on the list the best
and the 30th in the top 30 – we're number 30th
okay
we're number one in costs
that's a little bit like what i'm doing
i'm the least spent money
you know, i'm funding my own campaign
right
so, i don't have a lot of the people coming to me
you know, the drug companies and all of the – because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the united states, a lot of it isn't really waste, fraud, and corruption
it's the fact that people that are running against me and people in the senate, people in congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they're special interests and they do what those people want
and that's one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack
the military orders equipment they don't even want and the stuff they do want they don't get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it's not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don't want
it's going to all change because i'm not getting any money from all of these people
i don't give a damn
i mean, we're going to do the right thing
we're going to absolutely do the right thing
i'll tell you a little story
so the drug companies
we are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the united stateswhich makes a lot of sense i guess
but we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we're going to end
okay
we're going to build a wall
yup
folks, by the way, we're going to build a wall and who's going to pay for the wall
you better believe it
we have a trade deficit with mexico of $58 billion
and these characters come up, these politicians that i'm running against, you don't really think mexico is going to pay for the wall
i said, absolutely, 100%
they said, how are you going to get mexico to pay
and i don't want to get into it because they won't understand it
i mean, they have no concept of business
they have no – you know, the $150 billion we gave to iran, these people have no concept
we have a $58 billion trade deficit with mexico
okay
the wall is going to cost $12 billion
maybe less
if i build it, it'll be taller, better, and less
okay
so you think of this
so you think of this
so they said, how are you going to possibly do it
they make so much money
plus we give them subsidy
they make so much money from the united states it's going to be one of the easiest things
and i don't know if you've heard, one of the presidents or ex-presidents of mexico held a news conference
he said, we will never ever, ever pay for the wall
and the press called me
they said, they said they will never pay for the wall
i said, who was it
calderon
he's very nice, good guy
i said, tell him the following
the wall just got 10 feet higher
i mean it
it got 10 feet higher
yeah, they're going to pay for it
and i get along great with mexico
the problem is – i mean, they buy apartments
i have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are hispanics who i'm doing great with
we have such an amazing relationship with hispanics and they're great people
the problem is the leaders of mexico are too smart for our leaders
they're too smart
they're too cunning
you look at what's going on
it's unbelievable
the border is a disaster
it's a sieve
people flow over
it's not going to happen anymore, folks
people can come into our country but they're going to come in legally
they're going to come in through a process
they're going to come in, they're going to come in legally
so with trade, we're going to solve the trade problem
i don't know if you saw carrier air conditioner announced two days ago they're moving to mexico
nabisco
they're moving their big plant from chicago to mexico
ford, they're moving this massive complex – they're building a $2
5 billion plant and now they've just announced they're building it bigger
i've been talking about this for two years
yesterday, the wall street journal, they announced they're building it bigger
in another words, they're doubling down
you know why
nobody does anything about it
i'm going to do something about it
so i watched – somebody asked, what would you do about carrier
because that was a sad case
somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, you're out of work
you're out of job
forget it
it's over
we're moving to mexico
are crying
grown men that have been there for a long time
really incredible people
and they're crying and they're devastated and they lost their job and they've never had another job and now this plant – this whole thing is moving to mexico
and they said, what would you do
i said i'll tell you what i'm going to do because you know they talk about free trade
i'm a free trader
but i say oh if i put a tax on these characters – these idiots
i mean, they're like stupid
they say donald trump is not a true conservative because he taxes
it's got to be fair stuff, folks
it's got to be fair
i'm a conservative person
hey, i'm the most conservative on the border
i'm the most conservative with the military
nobody's tougher than me
i'm the most conservative
we are going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful, nobody's ever going to mess with us, folks
we won't have to use it
i'm the most conservative on taking care of the vets
our vets are treated horribly
we're going to take care of our – i'm the most conservative on common core
we're ending common core – i told you that – and we're moving it locally
and nobody is more conservative and we call toughness but nobody is more conservative on the second amendment
so all of these things
but with carrierthey're coming across and they're going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from mexico – probably – we've probably given them subsidies
they probably have the united states giving subsidies to move out of the country
that's how stupid it is and that's how stupid we're runningthey said, what would you do
i say it's very easy
we call them
we say let's have a meeting
here's the story folks
you're moving to mexico
congratulations
but if you don't stay in the united states you're going to have a problem
but here's what you do it
you want to move to mexico, build your factory, it's going to be wonderful
hire your people they're not from the united states
all those people are now looking for jobs
those are good jobs
you know we're hiring a lot of part-timers nowthe numbers are totally phony
the 5% – totally phony numbers
so i say here's what we're going to do
very simple
you build your plant in mexico
enjoy yourselves
and you're going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the united states
no, you're going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner
it's true
it's the only thing you can do
and you know what
it's the only thing you can do
there's nothing else
because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop
and then you have the devaluation with china
the all-time
they're like grand chess masters or grand – i mean these people are the greatest – the greatest in history
they're grandmasters of that – devaluation
they devalue their currency
japan is doing very well too
they're killing caterpillar
you know, they're ordering komatsu tractors now because they've devalued – look, you take a look at what's happened to the yen and it's very hard
a friend a mine
he's a big excavator
you all know excavators
i love excavators
this guy's a very big one
he buys caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators
he just put in a big order for komatsu
not that he wanted to
he said, donald, they made it impossible for me not to buy
they've devalued the yen to such an extent – japan – that it made it, i mean, i owe it to my family, to my company, to myself
i have no choice
and he was like depressed
he wanted to buy caterpillar
well china is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what they're doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete
we can't allow that stuff to happen
look, when we send stuff over to china, it doesn't get in
if it does get in, you have to pay a big tax
you know, it's not supposed to be that way
you know, it's supposed to be free trade
it's supposed to be they come we go, back and forth
they devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible
i have a friend who's a great manufacturer
he said it's virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do
he can't get his goods into china
when he does get them in, there's a tax to pay
i have a friend who actually bought an airplane and he can't get it into china because the tax is so massive
he's going to sell it now at a big loss
okay
and think about boeing
okay
think about boeing
boeing is building a plant over here
boeing just had a big order from china
but china is making them build a massive airline facility
right
massive
like bigger than anything you've seen
okay, you feel good about boeing right now
tell me in five years
unless i'm president
you'll be fine
don't worry about it
but tell me in five years you're going to feel good about boeing because i'll tell you what's happening
they are going to build that plant – they're building it, it's going to be finished soon – they're going to build that plant, they're going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you'll be reading a big front page story all over the place that boeing is going to leave, right, south carolina, they're going to make all their planes in china
because this is what they do
that's what they do
and our leaders aren't smart enough to stop it, okay
i have carl icahn endorse me
great businessman, very rich guy, very, very successful
if i told carl, carl, watch over china trade, we're going to be in great shape
we have right now people that have no concept of what they're doing
they have no concept of what they're doing
they're political hacks
that's what they are
they're political hacks and these are the people that are negotiating with these people china
and again, china likewise, i get along great with china
largest bank in the world my tenant
they buy condos for tens of millions of dollars
i have the bank of america building in california
i own a big chunk of that
i got that through china through a very complex set of transactions but through china
i mean, i think china is terrific
i'm not angry at china
i'm angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with china
i'm not angry
so we're going to get things changed around
we're going to use our best people
we're going to be so smart, and we're going to start winning again
we're going to have strong borders
we're going to have strong military
we're going to take care of our vets
we're going to have such great trade deals
we're going to win again
we're going to win again
we're going to win so much
and you know, and by the way, we are going to get rid of isis and we're going to get rid of them fast
i was against the war in iraq from the beginning
i was against the war in iraq
we shouldn't have done it
we did it
then obama got out the wrong way
we shouldn't have done iraq
we did it
it destabilized the middle east
exactly
if you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, i said it's going to totally destabilize the middle east because you had iran and iraq and they were the same militarily
they'd fight, fight, fight
boom
then they'd rest
then they'd fight, fight, fight for years and years and years
we decapitated iraq and now iran is taking over
not only do they get the $150 billion
maybe the worst transaction i've ever seen negotiated
no, no, don't buy the famous obama administration
the worst, one of the dumbest deals i've ever seen
i mean, we get nothing
we get nothing
we should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating
not now
we should have gotten them years ago
but if you look at what's going on and now on top of that we gave them iraq because iran is now taking over iraq
it's just taking them over
so here's what we did
we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who we all love all over the place
they're the best people
most incredible
they're tougher than all of us these people
i mean, what they've gone through
so the wounded warriors all over the place
you know what we have
we have nothing
we have nothing
we have absolutely nothing
so here's what we're going to do
we're going to change things around
we're going to be smart
and we have – we'll do what we have to do in terms of isis and all
but we have to start rebuilding our country
we have $4 trillion in the various places
$4 trillion
not going to happen anymore
we're going to have a strong military
but we're going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals
i mean, our country is like a third world country
you go over to qatar, you go over to some of these places in the middle east
you go to china
you see the airports
you see the bridges
they have bridges that are so incredible you've never seen anything like it
they have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago
we've become like a third world nation because we're fighting everybody else's battles
and remember this, we are like the policemen of the world but we don't get paid anything
we protect germany
we protect japan
do you know that in japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with japan, if we get attacked they don't have to do anything
if they get attacked, we have world war iii, we have to protect them
okay
i mean, who makes these deals
we protect as an example south korea, who have a maniac right next to them
right
but we protect south korea
so every time we order televisions, they come from south korea, they make a fortune
we protect south korea
let me tell you something
why aren't they paying
they pay peanuts for what we do
every time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready
we have 28,000 soldiers at the border
so we take care of the world
we don't get it
saudi arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day
$1 billion a day
and we rent space there so we can help them
we rent military bases
we pay rent
and yet without us they wouldn't last for two weeks
they'd be gone
so we're going to change all that stuff folks
i mean, i want to be good
we want to be fair
we want to have heart
and we're not going to let these syrian folks in that we don't know who they are
we don't know where they come from
they're not coming into this country
they're not coming in
i mean, there are a lot of them
i don't know if you know it
you have a lot of them moving into south carolina
i don't know
have you heard this
and you ought to tell your governor don't let them move to south carolina
you don't want them in south carolina
and i know they'll say, well, we have nothing to do
we're state government
let me tell you something
if a governor from a state didn't want to have them, i don't care what it says, you don't have to have them
we want to help them with safe zones
we want to get the gulf states to pay
i don't want to pay
we owe $19 trillion
we owe enough
we can lead it but let the gulf states – they have so much money they don't know what to do with it
let them build safe zones
look at what's happening in germany
it's a mess
look at sweden
look at brussels
i mean, brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible
so when i call for moratoriums and i call for this, first i get hit with tremendous heat
right
then everybody starts to say, you know, he's right
same thing – on june 16th, i announced we've got to stop illegal immigration
the heat i took was unbelievable
three, four weeks later they're all saying, you know, trump is right
then kate killed in san francisco, beautiful kate, by an illegal immigrant
you have jamiel in los angeles killed
incredible guy
young man
the father's a friend of mine – a great guy
you had the veteran – 65-year-old woman – a veteran raped, sodomized, and killed in los angeles by an illegal immigrant
we've got to stop it folks
we've got to stop it
we've got to be smart
we've got to be a country again
we've got to be a country again
so i just want to thank – this endorsement meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community
i just want to say get out and vote
we're going to do something you're going to be so happy with
we're going to win so much and we're going to make america great again
that's what we want to do
make america great again
so saturday, get out and vote
thank you
we love you all
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much folks
i don't really think – look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally
i was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13
i ended up coming in second
didn't devote tremendous time to it
didn't devote tremendous money to it
in fact, i guess in terms of money per vote, i'm about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient
i came in second
i came into strong second
third, i think, was quite a bit away – i think 2,500 or something – close to 3,000 votes away
there's a big difference between second and third
i think we did really well
you know, as far as that's concerned
i think the press – some of the press said i did fantastically well
some of the press doesn't want to give it credit
i think we did very well
i didn't expect to do so well
i guess what did happen is one poll came out and said i'm 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people
but it had taken me back to june 16th
i was told don't even go to iowa
start right here in new hampshire
just don't waste your –
i'm going to iowa
i went
i bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals
we did really fantastically and came very close to winning
i mean, we came very close to winning
we came in second place
so i am very happy with what happened in iowa
you know, you had 17 people and i was second
now, i guess you have 11 people and i was second
and i think we did a very good job
no, i don't think i feel any pressure
i mean, we're going to just do what i have to do
and if it works out, that's great
and if it doesn't, that's okay too because you know i'm here to do one thing – the theme – make america great again
i'm going to do it
and i think we did very well – i think we did really well in just about everything we've done running for office
i think we have a very good result yesterday
it could have been a little bit better
it could have been one notch better
but it's interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, they're at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened – what just happened – they're at 1%, they're at 2%, they're 3%
nobody ever talks about them
and i'm at 24% or 25%, and they say, oh, couldn't you have done better
you know, i think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time i spent and for the amount of money i spent
well, i think i have – i think it fits me better, probably suits me better
i've done very well in new hampshire
i've been here a lot more
i have very good relationships with the people of new hampshire
but i've had very good relationships with pretty much everybody
i really don't
i really don't see that happening
i don't know what's going to happen
you don't – nobody does
we'll see what – you'll have many, many people that aren't doing very well
i am doing very well
but you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians – they're governors and they're senators – but they're not doing very well
and they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday
and mine wasn't
you know, it's very interesting
if you look at the numbers from yesterday, i got the highest number in history outside the one number – in the history of the primary
also, i guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had
no, i mean, i think we'll get a lot of sanders's voters
you know, they're very much into the trade world and i'm the best on trade
he mentions it but i don't think he's going to be capable of doing anything about it
no, i think we're going to do really well here
i look forward to it
we have a lot of events scheduled, yes
well, we do
we have one commitment long-term for arkansas actually where we're going to have about 10,000 people
but we're going to be back and forth very quickly
we're going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes
well, i just think, you know, i'm just happy with the way we're doing
you know, we've bonded with the people whether it's there or here
i mean, there's just a big bonding process going on
if you look at south carolina, it's the same thing
i mean, we're doing really well there
but we've devoted much more time here and south carolina –
it's not a question of learning
i mean, i just want to continue to do wellour theme – the theme is so important
it's just make america great again
that's what we're going to do
that's what we're going to do
not really a question of learning
well, if you look at the second place, people didn't talk about my second place
they didn't talk about it as positively as they should have
and yet, with marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me – that's a lot of votes by the way – they said, oh, he's surging
he's surging
so, i don't know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run – scott was mentioning before – one of the amazing things about you, you've never run for office before
it's incredible how you did
my brand's doing great
yeah
no, i think just work
we're going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches
we're going to be meeting with a lot of people and i think we're going to do very well
well, we'll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, i think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people
same venue, same everything
they had 200 people
so we have – there's a good bonding going on
well, i enjoyed it
i have unlimited, i have unlimited – you know, it's funny
when i look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million
i have unlimited
that's not the thing
the only – you know, i'm a businessperson
i want to spend wisely
and i'm probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly i haven't had to spend very much although i guess we just did a recent filing and i would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million
but i'm self-funding
and i must tell you, i don't know that enough people appreciate it
i'm self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not
so i won't be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera
but i don't know – i was talking to scott about this before – i don't know it's really appreciated by the voters
i'm the only one on both sides that's self funding
i'm putting up my own money
and i don't know that the voters appreciate it
when they go into vote, i don't think they say i'm going to vote for trump because he's self-funding and he's not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera
i'm going to tell them and i tell them
but sometimes they like it but i don't think it's something they vote for, which is a shame because it's actually a very big thing
you understand that
it's a very big thing
it's a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisionsor looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent
that's a real positive
i just don't know whether or not the voters appreciate it
i've learned that they're great people
i really, i thought the people in iowa were fantasticyou know, obviously i was second
i had the largest vote getting in the history of a republican primary except for one and i brought many of those extra people in
and they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of republican primaries in terms of iowa by far – not even close
i think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than they've ever had before
so i just – i learned that they are terrific people in iowa
yeah, i look forward to it
no, i don't think so
i have a very good relationship with marco
i like him i don't see that necessarily
you're talking about iowa
well, that could have been with the debate
i think it could have been the debate
i think some people were disappointed that i didn't go in the debate
if i had to do it again, i would have done the exact same thing
and the reason is – you know why
because i raised $6 million for the vets in one hour
so if i took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, i'll do that all day long
well, we're going to be spending money
we're going to be spending money – we're going to be spending a lot of money
we'll be spending money on ads and we'll be spending money on the ground game
i can't help it, honey, whether i'm celebrity
i mean, this is me
look, i think most people say i did a great job in iowa
i came in second
i spent far less than anybody else
and had i known that i was going to be liked as much as i am in iowa and people did like me – you will understand that – i would have maybe spent a little bit more and i would have been there a little bit more and maybe i would have won it
but, you know, i'm very happy with it
i have 7 delegates right at the top
you look at other people in all fairness – senators, governors – they're, you know, they're way down
when i have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people don't mention that
but the one thing is you people don't mention that
you don't mention all the other names
now, you mention the person, marco, good guy
but he came in third
and they make it sound like he had a victory and i didn't
but i came in second
i started off on 17th
i was 17th
when i first started, i had nothing
and then i inched my way up – went pretty rapidly actually
and now i'm leading everything and i did okay in iowa
pretty good in iowa
well, i think we're going to have great success here
i think it's a much different kind of a process
this isn't a caucusing process
this is a much different – this is a normal voting process
the iowa is a much different kind of a thing
well, he  insulted me
i mean, he started with the insults, as you know
and he insulted ben carson by doing what he did to ben carson
that was a disgrace
and he insulted the people of iowa by doing a voter violation form that nobody's ever seen before which was disgraceful
no, no, he's a man of insult
no, i'm going
i have thousands of people going
no, but we don't have that invite
i like mike huckabee but no, i don't think he's even going to be there
i did
i did
no, i like him
well, he's left the race so i feel pretty good about that
he's a good man
well, we're adding some and we're adding them pretty rapidly
people in your world are saying they possibly could
so i don't really see one or two
i see there could be a number
i'd love to finish first
you know, again it would still not be horrible because you're competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives
i have been a politician for 6 months
no, but i'd love to finish first
wouldn't horrible but you know it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
i could think of worse things
but i'd like to finish first
i think we will finish first
i'd like to finish first
just so you understand
i am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations for $10, $15, $20
no, no, that's merchandise sales
that's a lot of merchandise sales
it's a small amount of money compared to what i put in
it's very hard when somebody sends you a check for $17
50 and $9 and $200, very hard to send that back
i am
and i always make the reference
i always make a reference to that and i do it every time
well, he's  somebody that i respect, always liked
and he's very, very respected throughout the country but he's very respected here
and everybody wanted his endorsement and i'm very honored that he's giving it to me and he's going to give it to me on the stage
that happens with endorsements
no, that happens with endorsement
it's pretty common with endorsements
a poll came out a few days before that said i was about 5 points so maybe there was a tinge
and again, it may have been the debate, which would have set records if i did it
so i would have liked that
but the fact is it could have been the debate
maybe it is
maybe it isn't
but i would have done it exactly the same way because i raised, scott, we raised in one hour, i raised $6 million for the vets
and i would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in iowa
wouldn't be worth it
i think her email situation is very serious
i have a feeling she's being protected by the democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that i've seen including gen
petraeus
if you watch and study and read about various lawyers – you know, that's what they do – they really feel she's in grave danger and what she's done is against the law not just against rules
it's against the law
i just don't know what's going to happen because i don't know whether or not the democrats are going to protect her
i never saw a race where they're flipping coins
i mean, they're flipping coins
what kind of a race is that
it's ridiculous
i thought it was terrible
i mean, you call it a tie
but to flip coins, they say okay, you're going to get this district
we're going to flip a coin
i don't know
i can't tell you yet
i think he's  certainly was dirty what he did to ben carson was terrible
he did the voter violation form
i thought that was terrible
actually, i thought it was terrible
and when they said that ben carson was out of the race and come vote for him, i thought that was terrible
okay
thank you everybody
thank you
thank you
wow, what a crowd
thank you very much everybody
such an honor
with the snow coming down and it's a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in
but you know, we won't wait
we'll go ahead
right
we'll go ahead
first of all, congratulations to the iowa state basketball team
you had a – what was that all about
i turned on the game
i said, wow, this shouldn't be that good of a game
and at the end of the game, i said, who won
yes
that was great and it's a great achievement
i also want to pay my respects to ben carson
they had a really bad accident
some of his staffers were hurt really bad
so i just want to pay my respects to ben
he's a good guy – a really good guy – and his staffers and hopefully they get better
say a prayer for them
okay
we've had an amazing time today
we've been all over iowa and we're going to be here tomorrow
we're going to be here so much you're going to get so sick of me
you're going to say, please, tell him to get out of here
tell him to leave
tell him to go
but we've had an incredible time
and you know it started really – we've had really a pretty good week
the debate last week – everybody watched the debate
and who knew about these debates
i didn't know anything about the debates
and it's been fun and it's been interesting
and i've been treated semi-fairly by the moderators
not 100%
some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair
and you know, a lot of the press hasn't been very fair
boy, look at the press back there
they must think there's a big event going happen today
wow, that's a lot of them – it's like the academy awards
but we've had an amazing – it's been an amazing experience and it started really on june 16th when we came down the escalator
we came down that escalator and it was – i said, let's go to my wife, who's been so supportive and so wonderful
i said, let's go
we're going to make america great again
that's what we're going to do
and you know, it's hard to do this because when you think of it i've never done it before
i've never been a politician
thank goodness but i've never been a politician
i've always done jobs and put a lot of people to work
tens of thousands of people over the years
and you know, i have thousands of hispanics that love me
the nevada poll just came out where i'm leading with hispanics, which i knew, i knew
and we came out at that particular opening when i opened and said i'm going to run for president i gave up a lot
you know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at nbc no more apprentice
that's hard to do
you have a top show and you say, i'm not doing it anymore
i'm sorry
they wanted to do it so badly
and steve burke, who's a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said come on, donald
come on
do it
you're not going to run
do it
do it
i said, steve, i'm going to run
i was pretty sure
you know, that was about two months before
i was pretty sure
it really is a tough thing to do
you know, all my life i've heard if you're a very successful person, you'll never run for president
you'll never really run for politics
but you'll never ever run for president
and i built a great company and it's a tremendous number
you saw the filings
the press was going to look so closely
it was like d-day when we put those papers in
you know, first thing i did i announced
they said, oh, he's actually going to do it because most of them said he'll never do it
then when i signedthat's when you sign your life away
and i signed that
they said, whoa
he signed that
well, he'll never file his financials because maybe he's not as rich as everybody thinks
and i filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable – you didn't hear a thing about it
oh boy, were they looking
i mean, were they looking
and almost 100 pages
the biggest report ever filed with the fec in terms of that
and it showed a company that's a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow
you know, the way it's supposed to be
and it's great
and the reason i tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the united states
we need that kind of thinking
we need that – whatever it is
we need a mentality that's going to – you know, we're at $19 trillion in debt
it's going to be up to $21 trillion
you saw that horrible budget
horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that's going to lift it
and so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which i love and new ones came out today and i'll tell you right now
you know, now that we're at it
and they came out some brand new ones – some beauties
and one's coming out – i guess a big one's coming out
i don't know exactly what it is but it's got to be pretty good because i see the response
i mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building
somebody said it's a barn
this is a very nice barn actually
but with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is
and we do have something special in a couple of minutes
to me, it's really special because it's a person that i think is a spectacular person
so it's very special to me
but then the polls came out and some of them – as an example – national polls 38% for trump, 20% for second
i wouldn't even names
right
i won't even mention names
i'm going to be non-confrontational today for a change
21% for the second
11%
and then they're all down
some of them are actually at 0% and 1%
i don't know
jeb – well, you know, jeb's got one problem
he loves common core, meaning he wants your kids educated from washington, which is immediately no good
and his second problem is he's very weak on illegal immigration
remember, he said they come as an act of love
i said, what
they come as an act of love
so i think those are two very bad points frankly
so south carolina just came out and that's 32% for trump, 18% for second, 11% for third
great
florida leading by a lot – 31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps
georgia just came out
i have 33%
yeah, don't forget that's 33%
hard to believe
that's with 14 people, 15 people
i don't know when they took it but it was recent
33%
connecticut – now, tom brady loves me and that's sort of like, you know, and i love tom brady by the way
35% to 18% to 9% to 2%
you know, to nothing
maryland just came out
maryland – great place – 32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out
you ever hear of a place called iowa
oh, i love this
we're doing actually great
first of all, i have to tell you
you know, they never report it
even cnn doesn't report it
cnn does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll
the cnn poll was 33% for trump, 20% for chris
nobody talks about it
nobody talks about it
they don't talk about it
they talk about – cnn is reporting other people's polls
so, i call up
i say, wait a minute
you're cnn
you spent a fortune on polls and you don't report your own polls because i'm winning by a lot
and they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls
but we're doing well
i think we're doing a lot better than anyone knows
gravis just came out – 34% for trump, 28% for cruz
ppp 28% for trump, 26% for cruz
in other words, it's a little close here
quinnipiac poll – very respected 31% for trump, 29% for cruz
and then again cnn 33% to 20%
so we're – i think we're doing good
i think we're actually doing better than the polls
now, i could do this
i could say, well, i just want to do well in iowa
i want to win iowa, folks
because look, i love the people
the evangelicals have been phenomenal
i'm doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide i'm winning with evangelical – i don't know if you know that – by a lot nationwide
with iowa, i'm doing really well with the evangelicals
we're doing really well with the tea party
we're doing well – i mean, you hear the numbers
i mean, these are the numbers
but i actually think we're doing even better than the polls
and you know, there's the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, are you going to vote for trump
he's got very, very tough immigration policies
he wants to destroy obamacare and replace it with something a lot better
i'm going to do that
okay
but you know, a lot of people, they'll pick up the phone and they'll hear different things and they'll say, uh, no i'll vote for –  and then they'd get in the booth and they say, trump is my man
there are a lot of people saying that we're going to do a lot better
but we'll see because feb
1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out
you've got to do it
otherwise, we've all wasted our time
you know, one of the groups in maine and it was like incredible
we were in different places up in new england recently and new hampshire was amazing
and the people are standing there
it was so cold
there was one little group of – despite global warming – you know, you hear about it was so cold
it was windchill below zero
and people were standing outside for hours trying to get in
and then you hear the announcers
well, will they show up to vote
and i don't know much but i say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn't believe in tennessee, in texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they'll stand for hours and hours to get in
why aren't they going to go and vote
or in your case caucus
why aren't they going to go and vote
it's sort of an amazing thing
so we think they're going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote
now, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different
it's a very interesting system
but it is different
here's what i have to say about iowa
it's very important
so you know there's a movement to move iowa to the back of the pack
okay
you know that
you'll still see me but you won't see other people
believe me
i'm loyal
to a fault i'm loyal
but you're going to see
i give you my word
i win
they're not touching iowa
this is an amazing tradition
no, seriously
this is an amazing tradition
they're not moving iowa back
and they're not moving new hampshire either because they're talking about iowa, new hampshire
they're not touching new hampshire
so, we're going to just keep it the way it is
it really is
it's an amazing
first of all, you're amazing people
but all over the country it's a movement all over the country
the people are incredible
they want to make america great again
they're going to do something that's special
and you know we used to talk silent majority
i say it's the noisy majority because it's actually a noisy majority
it's not a silent majority
but people are fed up
so i started on june 16th and we did well
practically from the beginning we went up
and if you remember, we started at nothing
you know, we started at nothing because nobody believed i was going to
even when they – my wife said, you know if you run, you're going to win
i said, what do you mean
she said, people don't believe you're going to run
at the polls
i was getting these little polls
i felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors
they get these little polls
jeb again, right
boy, he's taking a lot of abuse
you know
i told him you know what
you should use the name bush
what's wrong
use the name bush
i mean, maybe it's not working but it's better than jeb right
you know, i really do
get rid of the exclamation point and just put jeb bush
it's your name
don't be ashamed of your name
so anyways, i wish him the best
but, you know, i started and i started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%
and each time the pundits – these real geniuses back here – some of them are sitting back here – these real geniuses like george will with the little glasses – take away the glasses
he looks like a dumb guy, i'm telling you
but each time these geniuses would say, well, he's reached his plateau
he's plateaued at 6%, right
then it goes to 11%
well, you know, this is surprising but he's reached his plateau
and then it goes to 18%
and then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%
then it went actually 42% in the gravis poll and in reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that
and then all of a sudden you didn't hear so much about the plateau
i want to plateau at 42%
you know, 42% with like 14 people that's pretty good
but they kept saying, he's plateaued
that's all he'll get
he's got these followers
we have the smartest followers there are
number one, we have the smartest
and the hardest working followers
we have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back what's happened because our country is going to hell
we can be nice about it
we can say it nice and soft
our country is going to hell
when you look at this crazy iran deal where we're paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don't know where the fifth is and you understand what that means
that's not a good sign
but they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the interpol
these are bad dudes
they get 14 plus seven so they're getting 21 people
and they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint
right to do oil
right to do whatever they want
but what do they also get out of that deal
first of all, they're going to get nuclear
they don't have to develop nuclear missiles
they can buy them
for the kind of money we gave them, they're going to buy them
why are they going to develop
remember the deal
24 days
they have 24 days for inspection period
they also have self-inspection
right
but we paid $150 billion
and i always say, wow
what a great – the persians are great negotiators
i say what a great deal that is
two weeks ago i started
i said, wait a minute
that's not a good deal compared to the other deal
they took over iraq
we gave them iraq
we knocked the hell out of iraq
we decimated their armed forces
and you know, for years, they would fight
for many, many years, for decades they'd fight, fight, fight
nobody would win
fight
they'd rest
then they'd go back to fight
and now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is iraq
we gave it to them
now, they're going into yemen
and if you look at yemen, take a look
they're going to get syria
they're going to get yemen
unless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if i get in
but let's just sort of leave it the way it is
they get syria
they get yemen
now, they didn't want yemen
but did you ever see the border between yemen and saudi arabia
they want saudi arabia
so, what are they going to have
they're going to have iraq
they're going to have iran
they're going to have iraq
they're going to have yemen
they're going to have syria
they're going to have everything
they're going to be a monster
we've created this
we have stupid leadership
really stupid leadership
so when i started, i said we have to do something about it
it's not something i wanted to do
it's something we have to do
because i'm representing you
i'm not taking any money
i'm not, you know, like some of these guys where they're getting millions and millions of dollars from people i know and they're nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country
they have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they're representing
and these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they're told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors
me, i'm going to do the right thing
and i always tell the story
when ford moves to mexico, i'm going to talk them out of it
when nabisco moves its plant from chicago to mexico, i'm going to talk them out of it
believe me
it's going to be easy
it's going to be easy
so, i started and i talked about the border
very strong on immigration and illegal immigration
took a lot of heat
but you wouldn't even be talking about that subject if i didn't bring it up
and i talked about again i talked about isis and i talked about
but what really happened is after paris we had 130 people killed
and by the way, i told you common core is dead and second amendment is right this way
we're going to protect the second amendment
we're going to protect the guns
we're going to protect your guns
you know, if in paris and if in los angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married
she came on a fiancee permityou know, wonderful fiancee
she was totally radicalized
maybe radicalized him
maybe he was already that way
but we've got to start thinking
we have to start using our head
bad stuff is happening
we have to find out what's going on
we have a president who won't even talk about the term
if you think, he won't even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on
and you can't solve the problem if you don't talk about it
you have to talk about it
so, very, very strongly we started talking about that
and then after paris – and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world
you can't have a gun unless you're bad guy, you bought a gun
and they walked in just said boom
boom
boom
you, move over
boom
killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded
but if we had a couple of – few of the people that i pointed out – i could plenty in this audience, believe me
but if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks
it'd be a whole different story
so very, very big on the second amendment
but what happened is all of a sudden after paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in california, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked trump even more
i went up 11 points
i don't want to do it for that reason
but it went up because people want strength just like having the family of john wayne, who was great
i love john wayne
from iowa
but out of nowhere i got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who's an incredible woman, and she said, we'd like to endorse you
john wayne was a strong guy
we need strength
we need strength in this country because we're withering away with political correctness nonsense
okay
nonsense
i mean, if you think of it, you can't say merry christmas anymore
we're going to say merry christmas again
you go into these department stores
they don't have any christmas displays
they don't have the sign merry christmas
even people that aren't christian are saying merry christmas
we love christmas
let us say ‘merry christmas', happy holidays
but people like to see it
and stores don't put it up anymore
we're withering away
we're going in the wrong direction
so i said we're going to do this and i had no idea it was going to work this way
i figured i'd be in the pack and maybe like a race horse
you know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out
i had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally
we're up by so much
and you know, i want to keep it that way
i want to keep it that way
when you think – and just one thing before i introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest
but one thing – i've spent to this point almost nothing and i'm in first place by a lot
i tell this story
i'm not bragging about spending
i'm just saying i'm telling the story
i have spent – they'll tell you – almost nothing and i'm in first place by some polls have me 21 points
that's a lot
okay
you know some people have 2%
i have a lead of 20%
but i'm in first place by a lot
jeb has spent now $77 million
think of it
and you know the reason i bring him up – i wouldn't even bring him up – but he spends a fortune on ads against me
you people have all seen it before
i got along with everybody
i contributed to everybody
i was a world class businessman
now i'm a politician, which i'd hate to tell you
but you go with everybody
you want to love everybody
you want them all to love you unless you're stupid
but you want everybody to love you
everybody knows this story
but so much money has been spent on me
but he spent $79 million
i spend nothing
i'm in first by a lot
he's down towards the bottom of the pack
and i said to myself, it's amazing
wouldn't that be great if this were the country doing this
as an example, education
we're number 28 in the world
we have third world countries that are ahead of us
education is very important to me
world, i mean, countries that you wouldn't believe are ahead of us
you wouldn't believe if you heard the names of some of these countries
so we're 28
but we're number one in spending per pupil by far
wouldn't it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education
you know
so sweden and norway and china and others are the best
we're nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil
so we're going to change that and i told you we're going to get it localized but we're going to change that
watch, you just watch
i will tell you this
you can't educate your children through bureaucrats in washington
and that's what happens with common core
when the parents take over and i really mean this because i've seen it
when the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, they're committed to education
you can do so much better in iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in washington
and not all of them but most of them are just interested in where's my check
how much do i get
let's make the process complicated
and some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage
okay
so we're going to bring that back locally and it's going to be great
so what happened essentially is i started looking and all of a sudden things changed
and people are now looking
they know i'll do great with china
i'm going to do great with japan
i'm going to do great with mexico, who's killing us in trade and killing us also at the border
we will build a wall and you know who's going to pay for the wall – mexico
they're going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things
but now, we're really focused on security and i'm honored because i will tell you that all of polls and the cnn polls where said in particular that trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on isis, winning on the military, winning with the vets
we're going to take care of our vets big league, by the way
big league
big league
and we're going to really take care of our military
it's going to be big and strong and powerful and nobody's going to mess with us and it's the cheapest thing we can do, i'll tell you that right now
so it's been a real focus
i just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person
this is a person who i've known for a long time, who i've respected for so long
an incredible husband
an incredible family
and somebody that when i heard that she was going to endorse me, i was so honored
you have no idea how honored
and i would like to bring up if i might gov
sarah palin
special, special person
thank you
(audience members shouting)
let me just tell you  let me just tell you a little secret
it's the cheapest thing we can do
we're never going to have to use it
i don't think we're going to have to use it
don't forget they talk about my tone
i remember when jeb and hillary the same day  mr
trump's tone is not nice
they're chopping off christians' heads in syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone
i'm supposed to be, oh, isn't life wonderful, ok
look, we've got to be tough, we've got to be smart, we've got to have heart too
we've got to have heart, we've got to take care of people
we've got to fix our health care program
this obamacare is a disaster
you people know
you people know
obamacare is a total catastrophe
it's going to be repealed and replaced
it will die in '17 anyway
i don't know if you heard what's happening
but it's so bad, all the people that they didn't think were signing up are signing up
and the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up
and your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent
your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you're never going to be able to use your deductible
you're never going to be able to use it
so obamacare is a disaster
we are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it
there are so many great things we can do on health care
so many good things
wow
thank you
thank you so much
thank you
we start by paying our great respects to pearl harbor
we don't want that stuff
we don't want world trade centers
we don't want that ever happen to us again
it's not going to happen to us again
so i want to thank everybody for being here
it's a great honor
they have thousands of people outside and sometimes they'll say would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in
but we can't get them in anyways so what difference there
we all got lucky
we're together tonight
thank you
so we have a lot of big news today
to me, very big was cnn just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and iowa – great, great state – and in iowa, trump 33%
beating everybody by a lot
you have cruz at 20% and carson at 16% and going down and rubio at 11% and bush at 4%
but it's trump at 33%
it just came out
it's iowa – we love iowa
by the way, great ship named after iowa too
i've been on that one too
a really great one
the other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll
trump 36% and then i won't even mention the other numbers because they're so low
you know, when you have so many people running – we had 17 and then they started to drop
ding
bing
i love it
i love it
and you'll be losing a lot over the next little while
i would imagine
i don't know
when somebody's down at zero i would think that eventually they'll drop out
the only difference is there's nothing to pick up if there is zero
what do you pick up
so anyways you'll be seeing that
one of the things i think that's so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national cnn poll, on the economy – so important – trump 55%
everyone else nothing
on the budget – i'm really good at these things – economy, budgets
i sort of expected this
on the budget, trump – this is with 15 people remaining – trump 51%
everyone else bing
oh, here's one that i started and i took a lot of heat
i took a lot of heat
sort of like the one we're talking about today
i guess you've heard a little bit about it
but i've taken a lot of heat on this one
illegal immigration
now, had i not brought that up in trump tower in june when i announced that i was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me
you know, all of my life, i've heard that if you're a successful person, especially if you have very success – you've done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can't run for president
and yet, that's the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs
we're being run by people that don't know what they're doing
very sad
on illegal immigration, trump 48%
that's with 15 people
everyone else, no good
on a thing called isis…oh, don't worry
we'll have plenty – we'll talk a lot about isis
can you believe it
here we have generals
they go on television and talk
they do all talk
you people – a lot of military people here
who's military here
all right, i love you
by the way, speaking of it, we're going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody's ever going to mess with us again
nobody
they're never going to mess with us
you know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing we can do
the cheapest thing
instead of fighting these wars that we don't know what we're doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we're going to make it so great, so strong that people – gosh, they're not messing
they're not messing
and we're going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors
we're going to take care of them
because they – thank you, they are not being taken care of
we have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it's not going to happen any longer
not going to happen
not going to happen
so with isis – trump 46%
can you imagine that
with all of these characters running
on foreign policy, trump way up
and you know, in theory you could say well, maybe it's not my thing
but people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected
and that's it
i watched last night and i watched the president truly that didn't know what he was doing
he didn't know why he was there
he refuses to use the term radical islamic terrorism
he refuses to use the term
i don't even know if he knows what the hell is going on
i really don't
and then we're looking at hillary clinton
honestly, i know hillary
it's just going to be an extension of obama
i think maybe worse
she's got no strength
she's got no stamina
remember that
you don't need a president with no strength or stamina when we're being ripped off on trade, we're being ripped off on obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good
when our soldiers aren't being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today
one of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we're the least prepared now than anytime that he's ever seen it and he's been there a long time retiring
that's how we are
in the most dangerous world we've ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don't know – they don't – i'm telling you
i watch them
i watch these generals being interviewed
do you think gen
george patton would be interviewed
…they'd be interviewed after total and complete victory
gen
douglas macarthur
they're not big for interviews
you know, they shoot first, they talk later
these guys – and i don't think we'll have to
you know, just so you understand, bush – bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me
he was saying the nicest things about me
of course, he says he'll be elected
he's at what 3%
right
no, but he said some things and i was like – i said who says that about an opponent
you don't say those things
you'll find out what he said
but he said very nice things
but, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone – the tone – of donald trump is not nice
and i say it all the time
we have people whose heads are being chopped off in the middle east because they're christian and for other reasons
they're being dumped and drowned in steel cages
and we talk about my tone
hillary said the same thing
trump's tone is not nice
these people are living in a different planet
different planet
and remember what i said about hillary
we need somebody who's strong
we need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things
you know, i know a lot of tough people but they're not smart
that's no good
they're easy
we need tough
we need smart
we need like every character
we are so far behind the eight ball in this country
we owe $19 trillion
the budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion
it's a – think of it
trillion
trillion
trillion dollars
who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago
there was no such word
we owe $21 trillion in the very near future
we're really in trouble
we have to rebuild our country
we have to rebuild our infrastructure
we have to rebuild our military
and yet, we do deals with china where there's a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question
japan – they send their cars by the millions
$70 billion a year imbalance
that's like a loss
you look at mexico
we're going to build a wall
it will be a real wall
it will be a real wall
gonna happen
it's gonna happen
the people i'm dealing with – and you know, i really focus on hillary later because i have to get through these 15 people
you know, there's 15 of us
i had perry came at me strong
he went down
i had gov
walker, nice guy, he went down
every guy that attacks me so far they've all gone down
we've got to keep it that way, right
i mean, lindsey graham
he's at zero
he's at zero
zero
let me ask you a question
i don't get lindsey graham
i don't get him…he's literally at zero
you see him
and he keeps talking
he gets so much television
i mean, he's on television all the time and he doesn't go up
he's at zero, folks
his ideas are so bad
i'm more militaristic than him
but i know how to win
he doesn't
he just wants to attack everything
he doesn't know where the hell – ra ha
and he always sits with john mccain
it's like they're the bobbsey twins
they're always sitting together
no, it's true
do you ever notice
sometimes i want to see him by himself
he's always sitting with john mccain, who's fine
i'm not knocking it
but you got to know what to do
now me, i was against the war in iraq
so everyone says, you have the right temperament – i have a great temperament
but you've got to attack
if you've got to do something, you've got to know what you're doing
i said if you attack iraq and you wipe it out, iran is going to take over the entire middle east because you're going to ruin the balance
it was so simple to me
and actually they sent a group from the white house to see me because i got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the white house to see mr
trump
i said, fellas, you're going to have iran take over the middle east and that's what's happening
and iran's going to take over iraq as sure as you're sitting there
and by the way, iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world
we lost of thousands of lives
we have wounded warriors all over the place
$2 trillion
we have nothing
we got nothing
we have absolutely nothing
and we left
and we have a president – we shouldn't have been there but then we shouldn't have left the way we left
you know, the funny thing is i look at democrats and liberals and conservatives and republicans – wouldn't it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again
is that what we want to do
i'll bet you that if i spoke to that young woman, that quickly i really think i can convince her that we're all in this together, folks
we want to have a strong country
right
…but you know, if you think about it and you'll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what
they're just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera
but most people aren't and they believe something
and i have some very smart friends don't agree with me
they agree with the other side
but i really believe that if you took it about making america great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we're not vigilant –  – that was the same person
i've got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, i'll tell you that
that was the same person
you can do very nice but why don't you get her out because honestly it's inappropriate
so security, strengthen yourself up
see, our country has this kind of security
that's the problem we have…treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out
same person
one person
it's one person
they let her out
they gave her a second chance and the same thing happens
but you would think that everybody we're all on the same basket that everybody every single person –
…so you would think that if we could get together, we'd all be in the same boat
now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that i thought was highly inappropriate
in fact, i tweeted is that all there is
about the president's speech and i wrote something today that i think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but i don't care
i don't care
you know, we had a situation in california very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment
the mother saw them
the mother didn't notice anything wrong
i watched the sister being interviewed
believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy
i watched that interview
oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy
i didn't know, i didn't know, i didn't know
and i watched the next door neighbor saying, oh, well we didn't report them because we didn't want to racially profile or we didn't want to profile
give me a break
give me a break
we're like the stupid country in so many different ways
it's so – can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that's happening with us
they didn't want to report them because they thought it was profiling
okay, they saw bombs
they saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn't to build a bathroom
when a bomb is this long, can't put too many of them together for a bathroom, right
and we thought they maybe but we didn't want to racially profile
oh, okay, you're okay, you're innocent
or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to world trade center – the worst, worse than pearl harbor because with the world trade center they were killing innocent civilians
at least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were…but while it was an attack, at least it was military
but this was an attack on the world trade center
so, what's happened is we're out of control
we have no idea who's coming into our country
we have no idea if they love us or if they hate us
we have no idea if they want to bomb us
we have no idea what's going on
and then i looked at poll numbers and i don't mean polls where i'm winning
those numbers i like looking at
these numbers i hated to look at
and it's very, very sad
i'll go after some of the numbers
25% of those polled and this was from the center for security policy – very highly respected group of people who i know actually
this is people living in this country
25% of those polled agreed that violence against americans is justified as muslims
25%
51% of the muslims living in this country – by the way, i have friends that are muslims
they're great people
but they know we have a problem
they know we have a real problem
because something's going on, and we can't put up with it, folks
we can't put up with it
51% – 51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to sharia
you know what sharia is
so i wrote this out
the mainstream media wants to surrender the constitution
the mainstream media – these people back here
they're the worst
they are so dishonest
no, no, they're so dishonest
they are so dishonest
i mean, i have one from nbc, a reporter from nbc, and actually another one from cbs, they actually in columbus, ohio, i had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people
it was a love fest
it went on for a long time
everybody stayed right 'tis the end
i had one of the politicians – kasich – who is just getting – he's a horrible debater…he made a statement that oh, they left after 10 minutes
now, the press was there
they saw it
nobody said it was a lie
it was a total lie
in fact, i had more people at the end than i had at the beginning
nobody's leaving
nobody's leaving here except for the one person that was screaming
so, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn't want to do that because it's not their thing to do
you know, we get the biggest crowds
they don't want to show this crowd tonight
they're not going to show all the people outside trying to get in
they don't do that
they have the cameras right in my face
i say fan the crowd just to show – look at all the people over here
it's a record in the history of this ship
but they don't show it
they don't show it
no, no
and i say fan it and they never ever fan it
i say fan the crowd and they never fan it
and yet, i guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, i guarantee the cameras will be on her
i guarantee
it's disgusting
disgusting
…and by the way, some of the media's terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum
remember that
scum
scum
they're totally dishonest people
i had one the other day where i finished the speech and they said oh, trump was interrupted and he left early
i spoke for like 45, 50 minutes
i then answered questions and then i went around, you know, everybody knew it was false
amazingly, there's a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from nbc
she's back there
little katie
she's back there
what a lie it was
no, what a lie – katie tur – what a lie it was from nbc to have written that
it was a total lie
and they did a story where they – i didn't know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media
and they said it was a total lie
and i loved it
i loved it
i loved it
and then other people pick it up
you know it's nbc so somebody picks it up
third rate reporter
remember that
third rate
third rate
so i said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our constitution and our constitutional rights
and i don't want that
i want isis to surrender
okay
i want isis to surrender
very simple
it's very simple
so here's what happened
it's been a little controversial
it's been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof
i like that
but i have more…i wish we could call – is there any way we could call the election tomorrow
wouldn't you love that
now they're coming at us in full force
they're coming – not coming at me
they're coming at all of us
they're coming at all of us
because you know, we have a noisy majority
they used to call it the quiet majority
people are fed up
they're fed up with incompetence
they're fed up with stupid leaders
they're fed up with stupid people
they are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for sergeant bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who – think of it
they knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group
six people were killed looking for him
okay
six people were killed
young
unbelievable
i watched the parents on television
i've seen the parents
but i watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same
they left to try to bring them back
he left
he deserted
you know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone
it was called desertion
now i heard the other day they won't even do anything to him
can you believe it
they think he's going to get away with nothing
he's going to have nothing
so he left
oh, they treated him pretty rough though
he got in there, he said, i shouldn't have done this
this isn't working out the way i thought
anyways, so we get him back and here's the deal we made
we get a dirty, no good traitor
six people killed…they get five of their greatest killers that they've been after – after – think of it for six years
in fact, i hear nine years
so they get these – right now have gone – they're out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, i'd hate to tell you
so we get bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they've wanted for many years
that's the way we do it
the iran deal
we gave them $150 billion
it's called amateur night
we gave them $150 billion
24 days – 24 days – we think there's something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it's much longer than that because there's a whole process before the clock starts ticking
so it could be forever
but the best is where they have the right to self-inspect
are you doing nuclear weapons over there
oh, we'll inspect tomorrow
oh no, we're not doing nuclear weapons
you know, the persians are great negotiators
always have been
and somebody would say that's profiling
trust me, they're great negotiators
and kerry is a horrible negotiator and obama is a horrible negotiator
horrible
he's a horrible negotiator
these people are horrible
i always obama would be a unifier
i never thought of him as being like a divider because i said you know what
i don't think he's going to be a good president
i backed mccain
he lost by the way
and you know, i don't blame mccain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen
it was a tough one
but i backed mccain
he lost
i backed romney
he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost
and i said, this time i'm going to do it myself
we're not going to lose
we're not going to lose
we're not losing
and the recent fox poll that just came out has me beating hillary very easily one on one
i love that
that's so important
so, we put out a statement today
we watched this
and it's impossible to watch this gross incompetence but i watched last night
and we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy…
shall i read you the statement
donald j
trump is calling for – now, you've got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it's common sense and we have to do it
remember the poll numbers
25%, 51%
remember the poll numbers
so remember this
so listen
donald j
trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on
we have no choice
we have no choice
we have no choice
according to pew research, among others, there is a great hatred toward americans by large segments of the muslim population
most recently, a poll from center for security policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against americans – these are people that are here by the way, people that are here – 25% not 1%
by the way, 1% would be unacceptable
1% is unacceptable
25% of those polled agreed that violence against americans here in the united states is justified as part – think of that – as part of the global jihad
they want to change your religion
i don't think so
i don't think so
i don't think so
not going to happen
as part of the global jihad
and 51% of those polled agreed that muslims in america should have the choice of being governed according to sharia
you know what sharia is
51%
sharia authorizes – now look, this is, i mean, it's terrible
sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to americans especially women
i mean, you look – especially women
tough stuff
and we have a president that won't even mention the term and you're talking about numbers like this
trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it's obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension…
where the hatred comes from and why, we'll have to determine
we'll have to figure it out
we have to figure it out
we can't live like this
it's going to get worse and worse
you're going to have more world trade centers
it's going to get worse and worse folks
we could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it's going to get worse and worse
until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad
these are people only believe in jihad
they don't want our system
they don't want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life
they have no respect for human life
…so prior to paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn't have had the carnage that you had in paris
you wouldn't had that carnage
if they had guns, you wouldn't had that carnage
so important the second amendment
we have to preserve it and cherish it
and we can't let these weak leaders diminish it
if they had guns in paris, if five people in that room, paris and france has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice
come over here
boom
come over here
boom
people are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying
they're sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die
now, the same thing a few days ago in california
no guns
we didn't have guns
the bad guys had the guns
and these young people – and i tell the press you've got to stop calling them masterminds – these are dirty, rotten scums
these aren't masterminds
remember the guy in paris with the big dirty hat
remember the guy in paris – the mastermind
i was watching all the networks
i won't mention who but some of them disgusted me
the mastermind is on the loose
and we have kids that are watching the internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids – they go over there
they're young
they're impressionable
they go over there and they want to join isis
and we have our anchors – i think i got them mostly stopped
did you notice that
i don't hear it too much
but they say the young mastermind
oh, he's brilliant
young man, he's brilliant
i don't even he's got a high iq…in paris, i call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat
okay
not a smart guy
a dummy
puts people in there – mastermind – bing, bing, bing, it's like shooting everybody
you've got to be a mastermind
so the press has to be responsible
they're not being responsible because we're losing a lot of people because of the internet
and we have to do something
we have to go see bill gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening
we have to talk to them
maybe in certain areas closing that internet up in some way
somebody will oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech
these are foolish people
we have a lot of foolish people
we have a lot of foolish people
we've got to maybe do something with the internet because they are recruiting by the thousands
they're leaving our country
and then when they come back, we take them back
oh, come on back
where were you
i was fighting for isis
oh, come on back
go home
enjoy yourself
when they leave our country and they go to fight for isis or any of the other groups, they never come back
they never can come back
they never can come back
they can never, ever, ever come back
it's over
how about that
and now that they've become radicalized, they're totally radicalized
and how about the woman
she was in pakistan then saudi arabia
she comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy
probably a guy who couldn't get women
i don't know what the hell his problem is
it's probably the first women he's ever had
i don't know what was going on
but he became radicalized quickly
notice how easy it is
he becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree
folks, those days are over
those days are over
we have to be tough
we have to be smart
we have to be vigilant
yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques
but yes, we have to look at mosques
we have no choice
we have to see what's happening because something is happening in there
man, there's anger
there's anger
and we have to know about it
we can't be these people that are sitting back like in the world trade center, like so many different things
we can't be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in california, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn't want to tell anybody
we can't be that
we have to be strong
when we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly
don't worry about profiling
i promise i will defend you from profiling
i promise
so when i started this whole quest – i mean, who knew it was going to turn into this
it's been an amazing thing
no matter where i go, i have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed
we went to dallas – 20,000 people in dallas
25,000 people
mobile, alabama – 35,000 people
here, every time i come to south carolina, every time i go to north carolina, every time i go to iowa, new hampshire, virginia, wherever i go – florida – we have crowds that are maxed
the only problem we have is the size of the room – thousands of people outside trying to get in
usually i do a double
i go talk to them for a while, which i wouldn't say i exactly love doing after the first one
but there is an unbelievable love in these rooms – all the same
i love you too
i love you…thank you
thank you
i love you too
there's an unbelievable love in all of these places – oklahoma – 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice
there's an unbelievable love
and there's an unbelievable love of the country
we want to see good things
we don't want to be bad people
we don't want to be tough and nasty
we believe in the constitution more than anybody
but we can't let people use and abuse our rights
we can't let people kill us
they want to kill us
they want to destroy us
we can't let it happen
we just can't let it happen
and i have a friend who's a very, very successful man, and i went to one event – he came with me
we had 24,000 people
and this guy's a real tough cookie
he's a great financial guy
one of the guys i'd definitely use to negotiate with japan, china
believe me, you're going to be in good shape when that happens
we won't have these characters
you know, this whole thing with all of these guys
by the way, i'm the only one that's self-funding my campaign
everyone else is controlled
only one
i'm the only one
only one
i'm self-funding my campaign
and these other guys
you know, they're getting millions and millions of dollars from people i know
i have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money
i said, honestly, i can't take it
i don't want to do
i can't take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money – my whole life i've been taking money
now i'm sort of like what am i doing
but came in and i said, so what are you going to do
i don't want your money
and he said, i got to go someplace else
they're like gamblers
they're like gamblers
but i said, you like me best
i like you best but i'm going to go someplace else
because they want to be part – they want to –
…let me tell you, who is more than me
i gave millions to these guys
nobody knows the system better than me
i knew it from the other side
don't forget, i was the fair-haired boy
i was like the establishment
they'd all come to me, and i'd give them all money i write checks sometimes to senators whatever the max – bing, bing, bing
i used to say senators, don't come to my office
anybody that's a u
senator that calls me, we'll send you a campaign contribution
but you know what
i'll tell you something
in the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt pacs – they're corrupt – they totally control bush and rubio and i won't say cruz because he's been very nice to me
nah, he's been nice
he's got to hit me first
once he hits me, i promise you
i promise you
no, i've been nice to christie but he really hit me today
chris christie
i mean, i don't know
he's a friend of mine but he's not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today
he hated this and yet he said anybody could come
you've got to look at some of the statements from the past
but he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the muslims until we find out what's going on
does that make sense by the way
until we find out
and he talked about – that's inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right
but that's the statement of an inexperienced man…about we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in
does that sound like inexperienced
so chris, who's a friend of mine, he hit me hard
and i said i got to hit him at least once
so i won't do this a lot
look, here's the story
the george washington bridge
he knew about it
hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they're closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the united states, traffic flowing during rush hour
people couldn't get across for 6, 7 hours
ambulances, fire trucks
they're with him all the time – the people that did it
they never said, hey boss, we're closing up the george washington bridge tonight
no, they never said that
they're talking about the weather, right
he knew about it
he knew about it
totally knew about it
he's a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don't think so
but i don't know
it's called life
you've got to be smart in life
i would say there's less than 1% chance
it could be but i doubt it
he knew about it
they didn't mention at one of their meetings
i think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day
they'd just say, chris, tonight we're closing up the george washington bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you
oh, okay
they didn't mention
nobody believes that
number two
nine downgrades of the state
nine downgrades
it's a disaster
i have property over there – the taxes are through – i'll use an expression – coming out of my ears, okay
tremendous taxes over there
you had nine downgrades
you had christie, you know, so friendly with president obama during the flood
i actually called
i said, let me ask you
is he going to vote for obama
i thought he was going to vote for obama
i don't know
i think he possibly did
and romney i was very disappointed
one of the reasons i was disappointed was he called christie and had dinner right after the election
if christie did that to me, i would have never spoken to him again
i would have never done it
so when chris talks about – when he talks about lack of experience – i built this incredible company
i filed papers where everyone said wow, that is unbelievable
i would have probably filed them even when i didn't run because i built a great, great company
tremendous cash
tremendous assets
tremendous net worth
very little debt
unbelievable cash flow
and i filed
everybody said number one, he won't run
and i ran
i took a deep breath and i said, let's go to my wife and we came down that escalator
right, the famous escalators
hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay
but then they said, oh, well he announced
so these talking heads – most of whom are not even smart people, believe me
then they'd say well, they went to ivy league college
so did i go to ivy league college
they went to this
most of them didn't go to ivy league colleges by the way but they say they're brilliant
one's brilliant because he wears glasses, you know
like perry
remember perry
we don't like him
but what happens is they say well, he'll never file form a
that's basically where you sign your life away
i filed form a
then they said, well, he'll never sign his financial statement because maybe he's not as rich as everybody thinks
then they said, and if he does, he'll ask for many, many delays because you're entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever
and they'll delay it until after the election
i said, no so i filed it ahead of schedule
and what happened
remember
they went down
they couldn't believe it
it was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned
i built a great company and the reason – honestly worth billions and billions of dollars
remember that – low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets – doral, trump tower, the trump building, big chunk of the bank of america building in san francisco, 1290 ave
, land all over, land on the potomac, land all over
in north carolina, i have a great piece of property
trump national golf club
some of you know it
great, right at the best location
and what happens
what happens
so i filed and everyone said oh, i can't believe it
then they said well, maybe he won't do so well with the polls
and you know, before i went, people never believed i was going to run
they never thought i was going to run
and i told the story the other night for really the first real time
but my wife said to me you know if you run you will win
don't you
she's very smart
i said, what do you mean
she said, if you don't run, you're never going to poll before
nobody believes you're going to run
so if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren't great before i announced
she said, no, the only way you're going to get a poll number is you've got to announce
nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you're running, it doesn't matter
nobody believes you're running
so i said, all right
i'm getting these lousy early numbers and i'm saying, i don't know
i don't want to run and find out it doesn't work
i don't want to be embarrassed like lindsey graham and all these guys who have nothing
it's true
it's true
so i said, all right
let's take it
so we go down on the escalator
you know what i did
you remember i took a deep breath because i'm telling you and you know what i'm talking about the press down there look like the academy awards
there were so many cameras
i have never seen anything like it
the entire atrium of trump tower was packed with cameras and press
and i just said, let's go to my wife
i took a deep breath and i went down and i talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration
and illegal immigration was such a big subject
and i'm telling you had i not brought it up, it has turned out to be – and i took heat
i took heat like nobody has ever taken heat
rush limbaugh said the most incredible incoming that i've ever seen a human being endure
and then he doubled down a week later because i was right
and now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things
and then you had the killing of kate  and the killing of jamiel and the killing recently in california of a 66-year-old – think of it, 66-year-old – veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant
and many, many more
it's a huge problem
and they take our jobs and a lot of other things
so all of a sudden, everyone's saying wow…and from almost at the beginning, you've seen i've been at the top like from almost day one
…the reason i tell you certain things and the reason i talk about what i've done and lots of good things
a little thing – wollman ice skating rink
the city couldn't get it built for high years
they were in there for like $20 million
they couldn't get it done
i went to the mayor of new york, i said, ed koch, i'll get it done real quick
he didn't like it because he didn't want to be shown up
i said i'll do it and if it costs more than $2 million i'll pay for it
i got it built for peanuts
got it done in four months
and we had ice skating in central park and i still run it
i did another one – i did a bigger version of that recently ferry point out in the bronx
they were having – things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years
they couldn't get it done
i got it done under a year
it's operating now
it's very successful
it's what i do and that's what we need
that's what we need in our country
i'm building on pennsylvania avenue an incredible hotel
one of the great hotels of the world
the old post office site
think of it
i got it in the obama administration
everybody was bidding
everybody wanted it
one of the most sought after projects in the history of the gsa – general services
and i got it
can you imagine me getting it from the obama administration
because the gsa, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built
so they wanted strong financials
and they also wanted a great plan
so we came up with ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan
the job is under budget, ahead of schedule
it was going to open up in '17 – sometime during the year '17
now, it's going to open probably in september of '16 right before the election on pennsylvania avenue
and this is the kind of mindset you need
carl icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me
we have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore
pfizer's leaving the united states
in the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, south carolina
they'd leave new york or florida or someplace where the taxes are lower
they'd leave for north carolina
they'd leave – today they'd leave this country for other countries
so now, we're losing pfizer
we're losing many of our great companies
we have $2
5 trillion offshore at least
and everybody agrees it should come home – the democrats, the republicans
for three years, they can't make a deal
they can't make a deal because there's such gridlock
there's no leadership in washington
we will make this country so great
we have people and i'll tell you something
i'll tell you something… said something to me the other day and what i really want to do –  – what we want to do or what i want to do is i want to be the people's president
…think of this, think of this, i don't work for any of the lobbyists
i don't work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction
we don't
…the best thing that i've seen in going around and the thing that i've seen more than anything else is how smart the people are
they don't believe those people in the back that write with fork
i'm telling you, they don't believe them
the people are really smart
what's giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that i've met – the incredible people of this country
we're going to make america great again
and you know what
we're going to make it greater, greater, than ever before
and i love you all and thank you very much
south carolina
great
thank you
we love you
thank you
thank you very much, everybody
you just like me because my daughter happens to be jewish
right
she has a great husband, jared, and i'll tell you what ivanka could not be happier and she's very proud
the only bad news, i can't get her on saturday
i call and i call
i can't speak to my daughter anymore on saturdays
but that's okay
it's an honor to be with you
you know, i've devoted so much time over my life to israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven't done what i've done
i've received many, many awards
i was the grand marshal of the israeli day parade at a very dangerous time when people said, don't do it
don't do it
i walked up fifth avenue
i'm looking up for lots of trouble
but i said, no way am i not going to do it
and it was a rough time as you know
it was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade
maybe their most successful parade that they ever had
so, i'm in a different position than the other candidates because i'm the one candidate i don't want any of your money
i want your support but i don't want your money
i'm self-funding my campaign
it's been an amazing experience for me because i have very little money invested so far
i thought by this time i'd have about 30 million in ads and i have none although i took a small radio commercial the other day in iowa
but we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising
and i think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it
at first, i was embarassed by that
i said, you know, i think we're going to have spend money just to spend money but it's not really like a good thing to do because i am in first place by a lot
it's not even close
every single poll, every single state
the numbers just came in three minutes ago in new hampshire – the ppp poll – trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board
they have to drop out pretty soon i guess, right
most of importantly, favorability – no, i still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and i beat hillary in the fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%
that's ultimately the most important
and you know, i've been a tremendous fan and i've been a tremendous contributor
i've given a lot of money recently to hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response
they do a fantastic job
and my father, fred, was always a big supporter
so i grew up in that environment
i grew up in brooklyn, queens, and israel was always very paramount in our mind
in fact, i've been sometimes criticized because i received so many awards from jewish groups, and they look at my wall
it's loaded up
but now the christians are catching up, i have to tell you
my christians are liking me a lot lately and they've been great
they have been great
so, obama is the worst thing that's ever happened to israel
the worst
the worst
and when i see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-israel, very – i mean, they love israel
they love it with passion, and they're having fundraisers for obama
i said, what are you doing
and it's almost like they answer me and they say, we don't know
he comes to new york
we don't know
we don't know
i said he's a disaster
i really believe the iran deal
look, i'm a negotiator like you folks
we're negotiators
we don't build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, afghanistan for $43 million – can you imagine this
a small gas station – $43 million – and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don't sell that type of gas
okay
$43 million for a gas station
how many think they could have done it for less
would you raise your hands please
but i look at obama, i look at that deal where we gave to iran $150 billion
they don't need to develop nuclear weapons
they can buy them
they can buy them
it's true
why do they have to develop them
they can buy them
we gave them $150 billion
they go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect
how about that
on their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect
we're going to let them self-inspect
and then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we're all good with contracts don't start until such and such happens
it could be forever before you ever go into inspect
and we don't even get our prisoners back
and now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three
they don't want to give us our four
you know we have four
but they only want to talk three
now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago
and maybe better than any audience, i mean, the people in this room understand what i'm saying
it should have been you walk in – by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long
and we conceded on every single
we didn't win anything
we didn't win anything
but that should have been with our prisoners – day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back
you don't want them
we need them
it will make us look better
both everybody is going to like us more
with the american public, any deal that we strike, it's going to look good
and you say that
we have to get our prisoners back
day one
they're going to say, no, we're not giving
and we're going to say, bye bye
bye
call us when you're ready
and then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions
i guarantee you within 48 hours they're calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back
it's so easy
now, the president, you saw that, and john kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator i've ever seen
no, he's the worst negotiator i've ever seen
he did not read the art of the deal, folks, i can tell you that
now, he's one of the few
he's one of the – biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn't read it
and obama definitely didn't read it
obama, ayeyeye
but they said – this is hard to believe but this is what they said – a lot of press back there so i have to say everything exactly correct because if i don't i end up with a – they said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners
it's really complicated
we want our prisoners back
oh, so complicated
they said they didn't want to complicate – so now, we're going to end up making a new deal probably at some point
i'd tell you this, look i'll just tell you this
if i win, before i take office, i guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back
they're going to be back, i guarantee you
they're going to be back
now, our president doesn't want to use the term – we had another event, which probably was – the one yesterday – probably was related
it always happens but it probably was
when i heard about it, i figured maybe not
but it turns out probably was related – radical islamic terrorism
and i'll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term
he refuses to say
there's something going on with him that we don't know about
now, as far as hillary's concerned, she's going to go with what he wants
she shouldn't be allowed to run
what she did is criminal with the emails
she shouldn't be allowed to run
she's going to have to follow his line because she's on a thread
you know, look, in real life, his attorney general, his u
attorney, his attorney general
so his attorney general is going to listen to him in my opinion
i think it's very dishonest what's going on with our government
gen
petraeus was given a life-changing sentence
other people have been sent to jail
petraeus was, you know, essentially – look, i don't want to get into it with the poor guy
what he went – for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did
and obama, i mean, she can't go against him because only does boom she gets indicted
that's the end of it
that's the end of it
so when you see hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he's got control of her
i mean, it's just total control
but i'll tell you what, she shouldn't be allowed to run
what she did was a criminal act
and remember this, this is a six-year – you have a six year statute of limitations
so she's fighting for her life
if she doesn't become president, she could have a real problem
does that make any sense to anybody
does that make sense to anybody
because what she did was just wrong
okay
and you know she's been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it's whitewater
i mean, her whole life is corruption
she was a horrible secretary of state
she did a horrible job other than traveled a lot
she traveled a lot, nothing ever got done
the whole – the world blew up around her
it blew up
500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn't respond
the truth is she doesn't have the strength or the energy
she responded to her friends
you know the friends we're talking about
some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there
but she responded – yeah, you get that, right
a lot of people don't get that
but she responded to a friend, but she doesn't respond to an ambassador that's asking for help
hundreds – hundreds of requests and she doesn't respond
now, remember this, i go every night to someplace
i mean, yesterday i was in manassas, virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd
the other day i was in florida, we had 12,000 people in sarasota at 12 p
with the football games going on
12,000 people
the convention center held 5,000
so we had thousands outside
i made a speech outside
i made two speeches…i said, you can't get me a larger convention center so i can do one speech
my people said, no, this is the biggest one
we set a record – a big record
we set a record everywhere
we beat the record of elton john
it's true
elton john
i'm no longer competing with politicians
i'm competing with the musical talent
one of the great musicians said you get the largest crowds of any single human being on earth without a guitar meaning who doesn't count on music
so it's true, we've had tremendous response
we've had incredible response
i think you know if you look at what's going on and i think based on the response, based on the polls – again i don't want your money therefore you're probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money
trump doesn't want money therefore we can't – even though he's better than all these guys, even though he's going to do more for israel than anybody else, even though bibi netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and i did and he won his race, so i was very happy about that
but he asked me to do a commercial
and they said i was the only celebrity
i don't know if that's – but they said i'm the only celebrity
i don't know
i'm not a celebrity
see now i'm a politician
i'm so embarrassed by that term
you know, my how life i've been a business, i've been a developer
i've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime
i have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company
a lot of people said, oh, he'll never file
this you'll get a kick out of
he'll never run because he'll never want to file various papers
and then he'll never file this and that and then you'd have to sign your life away
the first paper – we all know about first papers
you sign your life away
that's the end of it
he did it
then they said, well, he'll never sign and he'll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he's not as rich as people think
so i filed my financials – almost 100 pages
the biggest ever filed by the federal elections
and everybody said, oh my, it's much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers
…if i didn't run, i'd probably would have filed anyways because you know i built a great company and i like to brag about it whenever possible
it's true
some of the greatest assets – doral, you know, doral and turnberry in scotland and trump tower and many buildings in manhattan
just many – bank of america building in san francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things…
and the reason i bring that up is because that's the kind of thinking we need
and i don't bring it up as braggadocio
i bring it up because that's the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back
we have people that don't know the first thing about the word negotiation
i can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they're better than obama and they're better than kerry and they're better than the foolish people – the foolish people
it's so embarrassing when you see what happens
sergeant bergdahl, all right
sergeant bergdahl – we get a traitor
they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for nine years
you know, the deal was five for one
and they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal
you know about sergeant bergdahl
he deserted
six people were killed trying to get him back
they were looking for him
the general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, no, he deserted
he was a traitor
and we still made the deal
so we get a traitor
we can give him back
do you want to re-negotiate deals
some of us will re-negotiate deals
i would say about 99
9 – is there anybody that doesn't re-negotiate deals in this room
this room negotiates so i want to re-negotiate – perhaps more than any room than i've ever spoken
maybe more
it's okay
i've been called on that a couple of times too
but the fact is i want to renegotiate that deal
i want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from
the hell – they can have him even if we don't get the five guys back because that's not going to happen because you know where they are right now
they're right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in
so they get their five guys that they've wanted for nine years they've wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor
but that's the way our people negotiate
they're stupid people
okay
they're stupid people
it's very sad
it's very sad
so i'll just tell you that i'm going to win
i am
i'm going to win
i mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens
but i'll tell you what, i have a great secret service
here's a nice one, you're number one, they give you a secret service
i never saw so many people – talented people, great people
but i believe i'm going to win
i really have just a great feeling about it
and you know, my life has been about winning
i've won, and my life has been about winning, and that's what i want to do for the country
and if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, i have no interest
it's like the other day – ivanka, she's doing so great
dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and i said, honey, who cares
how can you talk to me about such trivial things, ivanka
it's amazing
see
now i'm dealing in trillions
i've never heard of trillions before
you know, with this – we owe $19 trillion
we just signed a budget that's so bad and the republicans – you know, we know where the democrats are coming from
but these republican politicians, they go to washington and they're going to end obamacare, which i'm going to do by the way – i'm ending, i'm terminating, it's going to be repealed and replaced with something much better
but they go to washington and they're going to do this and they're going to do budgets – like i heard the guy before we're going to work in the budget
it's all about that
what happens is they're going to do budgets like we're going to do this and that and i tell this story – then they walk into the capitol building, which is magnificent, and they look up darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels
oh, look at these magnificent floors
they've never seen anything like it
we've arrived
this is incredible
and then they become mainstream
we'll vote on obamacare
yes, i vote
they don't want to leave
they lose all of their courage
i want to use a nice word because otherwise they'd get reported for foul language
they lose all of their courage and they've let us down
that won't happen with me
so, again, you're not going to support me even though you know i'm the best thing that could ever happen to israel and i'll be that
i know why you're not going to support me and you know you're not going to support me because i don't want your money
isn't it crazy
no, it's true
you know, if i wanted to have your money, i think i'd have a damn good chance and i think i'd get more money than anybody else
do you know the money i have turned down
this has not been my life turning down money
guys want to give me millions
i would have made – poor jeb bush, i mean, this poor guy with his low energy
it's sad
no, it's sad
i came up with that term, it became so defining
it's like having it on his forehead i am low energy
no, no, it's sad
he raised $125 million, which means he's controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money
that's why you don't want to give me money, okay
but that's okay
you want to control your own politician
that's fine
good
fine
think about that, folks
don't worry about it
i understand
hey, five months ago, i was with you
who's better than me
who is better than me
i gave $350,000 to the republican governors association
i never even gotten a letter of thank you
it's true
$350,000
i didn't receive one letter, not one letter from one governor
stupid
the good thing is i don't give any – why would i give any more
you don't get a thank you letter
politicians – remember this – politicians forget, politicians generally aren't competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that's what you're going to end up having
but i would love your support but i don't want your money
i appreciate it
now, let's take some questions
okay
good
…i'm going to go there right after this
i have to go through – you know, you have to watch to make sure that the contractors aren't stealing and ripping you off and everything else
but to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important israel is to me, it's so important, i don't mention my projects
it's not like very important to me anymore
what's really important to me is the united states and making it great again
my theme is make america great again
i mean, it's taken off like crazy
the hats – it's going crazy
but you know, some of these guys try to copy it but i had it trademarked because we're smart
a couple of them got up
no, you see, i was making this speech and everybody stood up – make america great again… but nobody stood up to them
but we sent them a little notice – don't use that term
we're trademarked
can you imagine i got the approval
but we are – we're building a great hotel down the road
i hope you all stay and it's going to be wonderful…
…so i was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from ap and they did a very good job
very fair story
and one of the questions was about israel and the palestinians what's going to happen
i said – i used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make…can we think of any deals
we all have tough deals, right
you know, we have some good, some bad…
but i said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other
i believe – because i'm a dealmaker – i believe that i can put both sides together
but i said, it'll take six months
at the end of six months and maybe sooner – with us we have a deal instinct
a lot of us
and you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you're going to make a deal
i will know very quickly whether or not i'll be able to put that deal together
i used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together
there's probably no tougher deal
if i could do that, it would make me so happy because there's so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years
now, i said you have to have a commitment to make it
i don't know that israel has the commitment to make it, and i don't know that the other side has the commitment to make it
with that being said, you know, i have a good chance of winning because you look at what's going on
so i have a good chance
i don't like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how i feel about this or that
i'd rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room
i don't want one side or the other saying
look, i think people know where i stand
but wouldn't it be great if they could make a deal
but a lasting deal, a real deal
not a phony deal that's going to last a week and then bad things started happening again
i'd love to – and i will give it
you know obama, as you know he said it won't happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started
but i think it would be a great thing for israel – i think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and i'm going to give it my best
i'm a great dealmaker
that's what i do
i made a lot of money
i'm going to give it my best
it would be great if that deal could be made
by the way, israel has given a lot…and a lot of people don't know that
i think the public relations for israel hasn't been so great because israel's given a lot but hasn't been given a lot of credit for what they've given…
in fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in israel
there were things given
but i'd like to go in with a clean slate and just say let's go, everybody's even, we love everybody, and let's see if we could do something
but i do think this – and i do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons i'm saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that israel has given a lot
i don't know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that's going to be up to them
but israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they've done
i will say that
i will say that
so that's it
you know what i want to do
i want to wait until i meet with bibi
you know, i'm leaving for israel in a very short period of time
i know
i know what you're saying
i just – you're not going to be – who's the wise guy
do me a favor
just relax
okay
you'll like me very much, believe me
okay
and you wonder why you get yourself in trouble
all right
you're going to like me very much
it's going to be fine
but again, you can't go in with that – if you're going to make a deal and you could make a great deal – you can't go in with the attitude we're going to shove it down
you've got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone's happy
don't worry about it
you're going to be very happy
okay
don't worry about it
i think he's a very good man
i think he's been treated very badly
i think that our president has been unbelievably rude to bibi
i don't know how many people like bibi
but i think he's been unbelievably rude
and – i mean, we'll talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but i think the iran deal is the worst single thing
perhaps it'll go down – and i've been pretty good at predicting things
i think it's going to go down as the worst single thing that's ever happened to israel
i think it's a catastrophe for israel
and i think the fact that obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves israel to support this guy or even the democratic party is impossible to believe
i think it will be one of the great catastrophes
but if i get in, i will straighten it out, believe me
it's going to be straightened out
it's going to be straightened out tough and it's going to be straightened out fast
the one bad thing is if i get in, the $150 billion is gone
that hurts me and that hurts the people of israel
but the $150 billion is gone because it'll be gone before you get there
you know, we're talking about a year and more actually
although the election very quick
you know, it's coming up
it's now less than a year and you know we have the iowa starts on february 1st and then we go right down the line and it's very exciting
we're talking about a couple of months now for it to start
for a person like me, i mean, it's very exciting
well, i haven't been working too much with the arab leaders, to be honest with you
okay
you know, i told you i made commercials for bibi
i don't know if that's going to help me in the negotiation
i can tell you
you know, i'm trying to keep it nice and level, right
then i get people screaming at me
but i'm trying to keep it as level as possible but i for the most part don't know
the king of jordan seems like a nice man
i mean, i don't know
we're going to see
a lot of people like him
some people don't
but i think i will probably be able – what my history – you know, i took some heat because i get along with democrats, i get along with liberals, i get along with conservatives, i get along with republicans
i get along with everybody
that's what i was – i'm a businessperson
i get along with everybody
we have to get along with everybody
and i took some heat and i always explained that
i said, wait a minute, i'm a businessperson
i've got to get along with everybody
i live in manhattan
it's all democrat
i mean, it's virtually all – republicans don't even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%
you know, they get a very small percentage of the vote
got to get along with everybody
i think that's going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in washington
we have people that – they don't talk
you know, i remember that years ago because i've been a very political person on the other side but always very political
but years ago, the republicans and the democrats – they used to like each other
they'd get along
they'd have dinner together
they'd argue and they'd fight and they'd disagree and would have, you know, different views and things
but in the evening, they'd go out and they'd have dinner together with their families
you don't see that anymore
there's total hatred and there's total gridlock
i'll give you one point, which i think is important
corporate inversions
right
so you have companies leaving the united states and they're leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things
a lot of things are better
but they're leaving
pfizer
how good is pfizer
thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost
but they're also leaving because we have $2
5 trillion at least – i think it's a much higher number than that
5 trillion – that's out of the country that these companies can't get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high
they're so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out
so they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that's how much money
the republicans and the democrats totally agree that the money should come back
for three years they can't get a deal
there's no leadership
it's gridlock
there's an example of something where everybody agrees – all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can't get it done because they're politicians
they're all talk
they're no action
so there's something and it's so important
it's not like something where they don't get – like there's big disputes and we understand that
this is something everybody agrees – the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things – taxes paid
but they agree and they can't get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership
you know, honestly, i don't think anybody can say
she says she is
but now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because she's going very, very far over to the other side
i mean, bernie sanders has brought her to positions that she didn't want to be at
you look at some of the things that she's saying right now
but i'll tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesn't have the strength or the energy to help israel
i'm telling you she doesn't
…but just take a look
she'll come out and do an event and you don't see her for another four days, three days, five days
no, it's true
think of it
we don't need – some people say it's not nice to say
she doesn't have the strength or the energy
israel needs more than just our support
they need strength
they need real power behind them
because you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, israel's looking more and more – you know, israel has some difficulties
and one thing and i think you'll all admit it
these people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think
right
we used to think oh, that was easy
15 years ago with my friends from israel because i have a lot of friends from israel, they used to smile and laugh oh, don't worry about it
now they're saying, these guys are – they're dirty fighters
and they're not bad
you know, they're tough
they're not the jv
okay
obama said they're the jv
they're not the jv folks
we need tough
we need general george patton
we need general macarthur
we don't need the guys we have
i see them on television – generals
i don't want my generals on television saying well, isis is very tough
i saw a guy the other day
isis is very tough
i don't know
i don't need that
do you think general george patton – they don't like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy
so he would never make it
they probably would have had him thrown out years ago
but we need patton
we need a genius like macarthur
and we have those people
we have those people
i'll find that person
but we're going to knock the crap out of them, i'll tell you what
we're going to win
we're going to win
we're going to win
well, i think radical islam right now is, and i feel that's the greatest
and again, we have a president who refuses to use the term
but radical islam is – i'll tell you one thing i know isn't is global warming
that's the one thing…i know isn't
i mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said – here they want to blow everything – this is right after paris
they want to blow our cities up
they want to destroy our civilization, and he's worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax
by the way, i won so many environmental awards shockingly
no, it's true
and you know what i want to do
i want really immaculate air
i want clean, crystal water
i want a lot of things
okay
i want a lot of things
but global warming – you noticed they changed the name – they go global warming, they go climate change, they go – now i hear a lot of extreme weather
how can you miss with extreme weather, right
if it's cold, it's okay
if it's hot, it's okay
if it's windy, if it's hot – everything is extreme
so now they use extreme weather
it is a disgrace what's going on
and to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left
thank you
thank you very much everybody
…it's a great honor
i want to thank simon and schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers
for years and years, i've heard about simon and schuster's being a fabulous – i was going to say the rolls-royce, i was going to say the harvard or the yale, but they really are a great one
and i want to thank you very much
you've given us such tremendous support
and we did this quickly and i think we did it very effectively
it's been an incredible experience
we wrote a book and the title – crippled america – is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and i think one of the reasons we've been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is
we tell the truth
and america is crippled
we owe $17  and now $18  and now it's actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt
we have a military that doesn't have proper instruction from leadership
we don't know what we're doing
we're losing all over the world with trade deals
every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they're beating us in trade
and we can't go on like this any longer
it's impossible to go on like this any longer
i always mention as an example sergeant bergdahl, a traitor
we get sergeant bergdahl
they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly
and that's not the way it's going to work anymore
so we write about it in the book
we tell lots of different stories of lots of different things
and i think it's going to be very instructional, very important
to me, it was instructional
when i did the art of the deal, i think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional
even today when i speak, so many people hold up the book the art of the deal and the other books we've done
so this is one that probably not since the art of the deal, i have to tell this to louise and simon and schuster, have i worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time
we wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what's going on right now
it's a moment of time
and we got it done
and david did a fantastic job…and all of my people did a great job
they helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now
so this was not easy getting this in
but we see by the lines – the lines go down to park avenue
they've been forming since last night and i'm going to be signing books starting at 12 p
we're doing a couple of interviews and then we're signing books starting at 12 p
and that'll be very exciting for me
but we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours
i don't know how they're doing this but they do it
they find a way
so i'm looking forward to getting to the signings
well, i think it's a different book
you know, we just had polls come out today from iowa where i'm leading
you saw the new poll from iowa
you saw the new poll in new hampshire where i'm leading big
a poll just came out in florida where i'm leading big
georgia, texas
i mean, all over the place
and i think you know look we're doing well
and if you add ben and myself we're beating everybody by a lot
that seems to be the big story that we're beating – they call it the establishment
it's called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down
but i don't know
i don't know how his book is doing
well, i think my book is very hard-hitting
his is a different kind of book and he's a different kind of a person
my book is very hard-hitting
it says it like it is
and based on what simon and schusters just told me, it's selling like hotcakes
so we'll see
we're very different people
we have very different qualities and we are extremely different
and i'm different from all of the other candidates
look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me
we are going to take the $400 billion a year that we're losing with china, that's going to be turned around
the $75 billion a year that we're short on with japan
the $50 billion a year that we lost to mexico
and that's right, there will be a wall built
it will go up
it will be built
and people will come into the country legally
so i mean, much different than – you're look at marco rubio – very, very weak on illegal immigration
you look at ben and he's very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of medicare
i mean, ben wants to get rid of medicare
you can't get rid of medicare
it'd be a horrible thing to get rid of
it actually works
you get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse
it works
so when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of medicare, i don't know how he stays here
no, i think that really marco is over-rated
and frankly had bush been a better messenger, he has the better message
i mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn't been able to – marco doesn't show up to the united states senate
he's representing the people of florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and i'm way up in florida over everybody
but marco is a sitting senator and he doesn't show up for the people of florida, and i don't think he should be doing that
now, bush gave a very weak message
i agree with that
it was poorly delivered
but the facts are on bush's side and ultimately i think marco's going to be hurt very badly
and if you look at mr
singer, you have to see where mr
singer is coming from and when you see where he's coming from, i think people are going to say, whoa, we didn't know that
but look at marco's stance on illegal immigration
it's really trouble for him
i don't see how he can win
marco rubio's personal finances are discredit…all you have to do is look at his credit card
i mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards
and i'll tell you what, i love florida
i'm in florida all the time
and for years, i've been hearing that his credit cards are disaster
i would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that
but his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, i've heard about it for years
you'll have to find out
well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his – you know, he certainly lives above his means
there's no question about that
…i'll tell you what
on the debates, it's very interesting
because i don't really care that much
i want a room
i want a podium
and let's get going
because i don't really care that much
but a lot of the people that are candidates who i respect – many of them, not all of them – but i respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because hillary clinton was given all soft balls
i mean, she wasn't asked one tough question
they didn't talk about her foundation
they didn't talk about any of the problems
they didn't talk about the emails
when the email problem came up, bernie sanders lost his whole campaign
i mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint
in order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails
that was end of his campaign
first of all, people aren't going to his rallies anymore
he's finished
so unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she'll easily be the candidate
but i will say this
she only got softballs
that's all she got
and if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn't the same way
with that being said, i don't really care
well, i think the republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall
they coalesced at that last debate because i mean, it really started with me
the guy asked me a question
i think harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter
he's a disaster
and he was – it was such as horribly put question and so obvious
and the republicans coalesced around each other
it was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it
and all we want to do is to be treated fairly
but with me, i don't care that much
just give me a podium
what i would say is this
the networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else
you know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn't even want to broadcast it because nobody watched
okay
nobody wanted to watch
now, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people
i mean, give me a break
so somebody said, how did they get there
and actually variety and hollywood reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well – much better than the political press – they said solely for one reason – it was trump
i'll take the credit
but i'll tell you what i also want
i think that wounded warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates – enormous profits – by the way beyond anything they've ever envisioned
cnn was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad
they ended up getting $250,000
so they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad
the networks and the cable are making a fortune, and i think they should give some of the profits to the wounded warriors and the veterans
that's what i want
i'm giving them away
i'm giving the profits of my book – i'm giving them away to a lot of different – including the vets
…i have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women
this building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn't see that in the construction trades
i mean, it was totally unique
i have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that i have that are women
many – a proportion that's close to 50%
might even be over 50% if i analyze it
and they get paid a lot of money – in many cases more than men doing the same job
so women have always appreciated that about me
i've been in terms of employment really a standout and i've been honored for doing so well with women
what jeb bush was saying at the last debate
i don't know
but he didn't say it well
…i like telemundo by the way
i like it better than univision
i'm suing univision for $500 million
…because the country is doing so poorly
it's a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly
that's good
they're going to have some demonstrations
oh, good because it'll get even higher ratings if they do that
i think it's fine
i think they should demonstrate
ratings will go even higher than they are going to be
it's going to be one of the highest rated shows ever
and they're very excited about it
and i have a great relationship, as you know from telemundo, with the hispanics
you've treated me actually very fairly
won the poll recently in nevada
won other polls
and in nevada, i think i got 37% and leading everybody
so i have a great relationship with the hispanics
i have working for me thousands right now – thousands of hispanics
i've had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me
i'm a job machine
i'm a job machine
and one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close
i'm two, three, and you see that – two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else
and you'd almost say like it's about the jobs, it's about the economy
then how's anybody going to beat trump in all fairness
but i've had a great relationship with the workers
i've had a great relationship with jobs
and i've had an amazing relationship with the hispanics
and i predict that i'm going to win the hispanic vote
i think i'm going to win the hispanic vote
i predict, yeah, i think i'm going to get the nomination and i will win the white house
i think beating hillary clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad
that's the question i like
how am i preparing for my snl
well, i'm meeting with lorne michaels in a little while
afterwards, we're going to sign – i guess got thousands of people on line but we're going to sign and then later on this evening i'm meeting with lorne michaels and the whole staff and we'll start the preparation
we'll pick our skits
am i nervous
not too nervous
not too nervous
but we're going to do a good job and we're going have a fantastic show
we're all going to have a lot of fun
my jeb impression
no, i don't want to do that
i don't like showing a person sleeping at the podium
tom is asking can jeb make a comeback
i think it's going to be very hard
very hard
not about money
i just think – you know, i came up with the energy
and i just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track
you can't do that when you don't have that
i think marco is highly overrated
highly overrated
he doesn't have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things
jeb – he lacks the quality that you need
we're talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off
you need a very strong person with tremendous energy
thank you very much folks, i'll take the job
but and it's so important
and by the way, ben carson does not have that energy
we need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out isis, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money
you need somebody with tremendous personal energy as president
we have a president right now that doesn't have energy
i mean, you think obama has energy
he has no energy
and he's been a horrible president
we need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect
and certainly jeb does not have that energy in my opinion
from the guardian
ah, they treat me very nicely in scotland
go ahead
well, we just went over that
honestly, we just went over that
and it's only going to make it harder
you're going to see what we're going to do
you're going to see
but the whole thing with anchor babies, i turned out to be right
a person has a baby, lives in mexico or lives in asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here
now, we're responsible for that person for the next 85 years
i don't think so
and by the way, i was right, they were wrong
the 14th amendment does not give them clearance on that
and if you wanted to do that in mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country
you would be laughed out of the country so fast
so, that turned out – i was 100% right
we'll have to worry about that
we're going to take care of it, and it's going to be done in a very humane way
but we're going to bring back our country and we're going to have a wall and mexico's going to pay for the wall and you know why they're going to pay
and i have great relationships with mexico and phenomenal relationships with the mexican people
phenomenal
and they buy apartments from me
they work for me by the thousands – by the thousands
phenomenal relationships
but let me just tell you we lose so much money with mexico in terms of trade imbalance – $45 billion last year
plus, we give mexico billions and billions of dollars
they will pay for the wall
and it will be very interesting
and you know what
people are going to come into this country but they're going to come in legally
…a lot of european countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration
well, walls work
all you have to do is ask israel
walls work if it's properly constructed
not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace – all talk, no action politicians – they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it
walls work
all you have to do is go and see israel
they will tell you that walls work
we need pomp and circumstance
our country has no spirit
our country has no gravitas
our country doesn't feel good about itself
and the primary reason is we have no victories
i mean, where have we had a victory
where have we had a victory in trade
where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with iran where we've given them $150 billion and we lose everything
we lose everything
it's a laughing stock
worst deal
worst contract i've ever seen drawn
we have no victories
and i do write about it
we need some pomp and circumstance
we need spirit
we need a cheerleader
i thought seven years ago when obama got elected, the one thing i thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country
he's not
he's been a great divider for the country
he's been one of the great dividers of all time
i'm not saying dress
it has nothing to do with dress
it has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive
he has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened
…i'll go anyway they want
i don't care too much about the debates
look, i'm the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway
nobody else gets the really nasty questions
in a certain way, maybe they're defending me although i will tell you they're not doing it for that reason
i think it's irrelevant
i just – i like the debates
i've had the debates
i've done well in the debates
as you know, every single poll said i won all three debates
now, i don't know if i did or not but i certainly didn't do badly
but every single poll says – even cnbc's poll said i won the debate
so i like the debates
i think they're good for me
but we have to be treated a little bit fairly
as an example, hillary clinton – no tough questions
i mean, why didn't they ask about bill
why didn't they ask about all of the different things
no tough questions
now, that was staged by the democrats
and frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it
well, we're going to stage something properly also
but as far as i'm concerned, i really don't care that much
i just want a debate
i think debating is a good thing
it's healthy
gets everything into the open
but you don't want people like harwood that read a question – blah, blah, blah – that he wrote – that he carefully wrote
he thought he was such – his career – in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened
he could ask about anything you want
i mean, you have to ask about anything you want
hillary had only softballs
all night long
it was like this – here, hillary, hit this one out of the park
are you from russia
all right
i think our relationship with russia will be very good
vladimir putin was on 60 minutes with me three weeks ago
right
putin
and they have one of the highest ratings they've had in a long time
so i'm going to give him total credit
but we will have a very good relationship i think with russia
now, maybe we won't
but i believe we will have a very good relationship with russia
i believe that i will have a very good relationship with putin
sounds okay to me
well, i think there are a lot of economic issues
we didn't talk about trade
we didn't talk about devaluations
right
we didn't talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they don't even know what it means
but we didn't talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country – massive companies – because they can't get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere
so they're leaving and they're taking their jobs with them
the corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about
these were all things that weren't talked about at the debate
instead, they talked about fantasy football
i mean, it was a big question – fantasy football
i'm saying what about corporate inversions
5 trillion at least
i think it's probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can't get the money back to invest in this country
so they don't talk about corporate inversions at the debates
they talk about fantasy football
those are the few
i was against the war in iraq
you know, it was very early on
i'll give it to you
yeah, i have it upstairs…
well, you know, you have to understand, i was a developer
a lot of people didn't care about my view in 2003 and 2004
but there was a reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, i believe, in july of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how i felt about iraq
and i said very strongly exactly what happened
i said you will destabilize the middle east and when you destabilize the middle east, iran will take over iraq
that's exactly what's happening
and they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen
the other bad things are isis
i said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that
i've felt that for a long time
…do i think that it's time for some of the other republicans in the race that registering zero – in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which i assume is a mistake because that's less than zero
i assume that's not happening
do i think it's time to have some of the other republican candidates drop out
yes
there are too many people
well, i don't want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers
look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they're at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out
like, you know, look at me
i go to florida and look at the numbers that just came out in florida
37%
georgia
i mean, those are real numbers
these numbers that these people have – and i often ask myself
i asked mark yesterday, what are they doing
do they do this for their brand
because i happen to think it's very bad for their brand
i think  walker did a good thing
i think the way walker – he saw it wasn't happening, wasn't going to happen and he just got out quickly
you know, he was favored
don't forget
you know
that was before trump was going to happen
right
but he was favored for a period of time
favored
walker
gov
walker
they thought he was going to win
what happened is he got out
i think the way he got out was great
i think he did a really smart thing for himself
and frankly, other people should get out because i would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the united states and more importantly how we can solve the problems
so it's a great question
people should get out
ivanka
oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines – it's true – i get is when i talk about my daughter ivanka
she was just at fortune magazine for like something like woman of the year which is great…but ivanka is going to be very involved and melania is going to be very involved very soon
they're going to be coming out very soon
oh, ivanka is going to iowa
when are you going to iowa
very soon
i would say – i don't see threats
i mean, whatever it is i have to do
mark is saying what are the top threats to your candidacy
who knows
i mean, you're in the crazy world of politics
people change their minds
i'm going to make america great again
nobody else is going to be able to do that
i'm going to do it
i'm going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and i think that's awfully tough to compete with
and one of the reasons that in my book i actually put financials in there – i showed some of the developments that – i have many, many more because you can only – simon and schuster – you actually kept me to eight or nine pages
right
and there are four or five in a page
but i show some of the great developments that i have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, i show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago
now it's even better but we didn't have that certified yet
so i do that not in a braggadocious way
i do that because that's the kind of thinking our country needs right now
we are run by people that are incompetent
we are run by people who in so many words – i hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word
unless they have bad intentions which i don't believe they do
but we are run by incompetent people
we have incompetent leadership
there are so many things
like i mentioned corporate inversion
the democrats want the money to come back
who doesn't
the republicans want the money to come back
for three years, the democrats have said we want the money to come back
for three years, the democrats and the republicans agree 100%
you have a vast majority
maybe everybody
for three years
guess what
they haven't done anything
right
they can't even get along when they agree
so here's the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can't do it
that's a part of the problem
well, you're going to look – a lot of controversy with mr
singer
a lot of controversy with mr
singer
there are those people that probably wouldn't have want him to back
but we'll see
i'll talk to you
no, they all agree
they all agree
they just didn't want to go through the unfair questions because they weren't questions
they were statements
you see, they were asking – they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way
and by the way, i think becky is terrific and i think carl is terrific
but i think john harwood is not very good at what he does
but i think becky quick is a terrific person
i think carl is a terrific person
but i will tell you john harwood was a disgrace to cnbc
…the question is should the fed raise rates
they are not raising them because obama has asked them not to raise them
in my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen
and in my opinion, janet yellen is highly political and she's not raising rates for a very specific reason because obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn't want to see a big bubble burst during his administration
janet yellen should have raised the rates
she's not doing it because the obama administration and the president doesn't want her to
and if she does it, you see what happens every time there's even a thought of raising them just a little bit
and one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies
because if you look at the devaluations of china, of japan, of many, many different countries, they're making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don't have leaders that know how to say to china, don't do that
don't do that
because if you do that, we're going to put a big fat tax on you
don't do that
and you know what
if you said that, they wouldn't do it
if you have the right messenger…
i'm really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections
i'm not watching any of them in particular
i'll be watching them on tuesday night
but i'll be out there
we'll be out voting
but the election that i'm watching is the election for the presidency of the united states
that is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we've ever had in this country
we're so far behind
and we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership
that's a good question
okay
so, simon and schuster came up to me
they wanted to do a book
they wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that's what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country
and i said, i'll do it but we have to talk about the country
what happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture
and he did some great…photos
i'm smiling
i'm happy
i look good
everything was fine
and then he took one where i wasn't like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture
and then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture i had was that one
it's a terrible, horrible, nasty picture
but when you're talking about crippled america and you're talking about all of the problems we have, i can't have a big smiley face up there
so that's how we picked it
we picked the worst photo taken of me
i would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn't go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually simon and schuster agreed with me
okay
are the other republicans afraid to debate
well, some of them should be
thank you very much everybody
thank you
…i was telling some of the folks backstage, i never ever thought we'd do this well this fast
this has been so incredible
what's happened all over
what's happened in iowa
it's been really incredible
we've had some amazing results and they continue to come in
got a little shake-up in iowa
i don't know what's going on
somebody said are you going straight to new hampshire
now, i love new hampshire
we've got great numbers
38 to 12
that's good
but we fell a little behind in iowa, and some people are saying how can it be
and i come out and i was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds
everybody said and it's very true
i mean, look at this
somebody else would come, they'd have like 50 people and they wouldn't need this room
believe me
but everybody said without question in every poll – this isn't just here – that the people that are with trump are with trump
they don't go anywhere
they're staying
it's true
i see it
i see it
and we've seen it
you know, a couple of times i say well, that could be the end
then they do something and i'm 10 points up
it's the craziest thing, right
but we'll take it
but they say the people are with – we have the most loyal people by far
everybody says it
the other thing they say is for leadership, number one
very important, right
don't you think
leadership
i mean, when leadership is number one – they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot
so you know it's great
i thought i'd talk a little bit and i want to take some questions
you know, we can do a little question and answer
right
we have all these cameras going back here
and you know, it's always tough when you're on live television all the time
look, we have 10 topics
right
how many topics
how many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics
the bottom line is we want results
we want to get it done
but when you're on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you're talking about immigration and you're talking about the wall because we're going to have a wall and we're going to stop illegal immigration
but we talk about trade and we talk about repealing obamacare
and we talk about all the things that we talk about
but you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples
but in the end, it's really about results
isn't it
it's really about results
and you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways
i talk about industry
i talk about commerce
i talk about how we're losing our jobs to all of these different countries
and i give different examples
but it's still going to be a certain number of subjects
i talk about second amendment
i talk about fourteenth amendment
we talk about amendments
you know, that second amendment, they want to take it away from you
they really want to do things and it's not going to happen
it's not going to happen
at least with me it's not going to happen
that i can tell you
so i said today you know we'll talk for a little while but i want to do some questions and answers
i want you people to excite me for a change
is that okay
i want to be excited
and so we're going to have some fun
we're going to do that
a few things – i want to bring up a few new subjects
so, immigration, we're going to be doing a very strong number
it's killing us
it's killing us
and it's bad for the economy
it's bad for – all of this illegal immigration
and i have to tell you legal – you come in and we're going to have a good time and you're going to be there and you're going to do great – and visas – maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we'll do something, we're not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form
we're going to make our economy much, much stronger
but we're also going to get jobs for people that are here
people with us
we're going to get jobs
we're going to get jobs
but the illegal immigration – you know, i did this and i made my determination – i took a deep breath
because i'll tell you what, it takes courage to say i'm going to run for president
it really does, especially in my case where i have a great business and i love my business
i love doing it
i may never even see it
i mean, i own some of the great properties in the world
doral in miami
i may never see it again… turnberry in scotland, one of the greatest homes of the british open and all of that
i may never see it again
all of these incredible places that i have
but more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you're putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody's done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it
now at some point some of these guys have to leave
don't we agree
it's getting ridiculous
because like tomorrow night we're having a debate, and i wish we had more time for the debate
not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours
you know, i could stand up for 20 hours if i had to but who wants to watch that long
hillary's debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and i was – oh – it was – you couldn't watch it
you have hillary against a socialist/communist
and honestly, he's not going to win
just so you understand…he's not going to win and neither is she…
well, she's being totally protected because in theory she shouldn't even be allowed to run
she's being protected
it's a tough game and it's a nasty game but she's being totally protected
but she's going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys
o'malley
so he'll be out quickly, i guess
i don't know what's he doing
what do they do when they have zero
they have zero
and i wouldn't say it against our folks
but they've treated me – some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right
because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points
and you know what
i'm not going to even mention names
usually i do
i love doing it
but everybody that's hit me so far has gone down
they've gone down
and they've gone down bigly
and a couple of the ones and zeroes – they're the ones that hit the hardest
i mean, they're like desperate people
but they hit
one of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left
that means less than zero
and i don't understand
what does it mean
i assume it's a typo but maybe not
but when you look at the things that are happening with our country – the trade situation with not just china – i talk about china all the time because that's the main abuser, that's the biggest abuser
the numbers are astronomical
almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance
think of it – $400 billion a year
and they send stuff over here but we can't send stuff over there
they tax us
big tax
a friend of mine can't get stuff over there
the tax is so big
big tax
somebody bought an airplane in china here
can't get it over there
spoiled guy
rich guy
bought a beautiful plane
can't get it over there because the tax is so massive that he's now selling in this country because china won't let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax
i won't even tell you what the tax is
it's so astronomical that i don't even believe them myself
so i'm not going to say it because those guys will say well, he was wrong
all i can tell you is it's a massive tax
like you don't buy planes here because if you do, you won't be able to get them back in
and here, we accept all of their products
so we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with china
we have a $70 billion trade imbalance with japan
we have a – you know, with all that's going on in the south china sea and you look where we have a destroyer – a relatively small ship – over there, i don't know if i'd want to be the captain of that ship right now
but they're being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen
but you know, we have an agreement with japan and i love japan
i love china
i love all these people
but their leaders are killing us because they're smarter, sharper, more cunning
the leaders of mexico are killing us at the border and in trade
they're taking so many of our companies
even nabisco – my oreos – they're taking nabisco
right
i'm never eating oreos
i tell it all the time
they had some oreos before on the plane and i said i don't want to touch them
bring them back
i yelled out to bring them back
but i'm not happy
they're leaving chicago and they're moving their big plant to mexico
so when you see this happening, we have to stop it
and i'm not going to beat around the bush and oh, let's talk and let's be nice and let's say –  nobody can do it like i do it
nobody
honestly, nobody
we can – i'm not saying i'm perfect because i'm not perfect
nobody's perfect…
now, nobody's perfect
but i'll tell you when it comes to that stuff i'm really – there's nobody better
carl icahn endorsed me the other day
he's one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers
he says trump, trump
and he's not somebody that just do it
he wants somebody that knows what they're doing
he understand
you talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on
corporate inversions
you know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively
they think $2
5 trillion overseas right now
they can't get it in
and everybody agrees that we should bring it in
the democrats and the republicans
they've agreed for years
they can't make a deal because they have no leader
it's not like oh gee, we disagree on obamacare
or we disagree on something else
although i must tell you many of the democrats that i speak to because i'm friendly with all of them
i'm friendly with like republicans
i get a long with everybody
you know, everybody says oh, you won't be a unifier
i'll be the greatest unifier of all
why is obama a unifier
but i will tell you many of the democrats who voted for obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times
right
you can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything's going to be great
turned out to be a total lie
28 different times that they know of and they wouldn't have done it
but when you look at what's happening with corporations and the highest tax – we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country – but they have trillions of dollars overseas
and these are great companies in many cases
they have thousands of employees
they can't get their money back
and the reason is bureaucracy
it's very hard
and also big reason the tax is too high
they don't want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax
they'd rather leave it over there
and if they bring it back, they'll be using it to invest in our country
i mean, a lot of good things will happen
i happen to believe it's more than $2
5 trillion
but here's the thing and i use it because it's so incredible
here's the thing
it's not controversial
it's not like you have the republicans here and you have – everybody agrees
they've agreed you know that for 2
5, 3 years
they can't make a deal
and now what's happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the united states – two reasons – lower taxes but also to get their money
they've got billions of dollars overseas
they're leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax
and you're talking about one company i know of – i don't know how much they've written about it – but you're talking about 6,000 jobs just one company
you're talking about potentially thousands of companies
and i say it, in the old days, they'd leave new york
people would move down and companies would move down to florida or they'd move to texas or they'd leave new jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they'd move to another location
right
now, they leave our country and they go to other countries
that's what's happened
in the world of the internet and the world of very fast jets, it's a different world out there
and there's no loyalty
they're paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign
they'd like to move back to these countries
they bring in executives that are from ireland, from other places
and they don't mind
they don't have loyalty to the united states
so my plan, my tax plan, is something i'm very proud of
we're going to solve corporate inversion
i'll tell you what, we will have that money back – if i get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin
nobody else will be able to do it
nobody
honestly, nobody else even knows about it
the other candidates, most of them don't even know about it
it's not their wheelhouse
okay
it's not their thing
it's not their thing
their thing is getting re-elected
that's what they're good at
they get re-elected
and they make promises and they're all talk and they're no action
and the same things happen with these politicians
it's always the same
so we have so many different things and what i've done with our tax plan, which something i'm very proud of, we've brought it down to a few groups
because right now, you have to go out – people who aren't doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans
they'll pay $500, $1,000 because it's so complicated
and we're going to make it nice and simple
and we're getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love
but we're getting rid of it
they don't love me so much anymore
but i don't care
and we're getting rid of a lot of things
so we're going to have a nice simple tax return
somebody said oh, why isn't everybody paying
you know, 40% – a big percentage – will not pay any tax at all
people that are doing badly
they said – well, i won't use the candidates' name because i don't want to insult any candidate when they can't defend themselves
they said we want everybody to pay at least something
and i said, i agree
here's the problem
from the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you're talking about millions and millions of returns
you're talking about building the irs even bigger and it's a monster
and i could cut it down way down
and the money that you're talking about is far less than the administrative costs
so i said, i agree
except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it's too much
most of these people aren't paying anyway
what i want to do is bring our jobs back from china, bring our jobs back from mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with japan
i was in los angeles
ships – the biggest ships you've ever seen
cars are pouring off into this country
made in japan
we give them practically nothing
the balance is so bad
the imbalance is so bad
and then we have all the strikes
see, what our people don't know and only somebody that wrote the art of the deal or does this stuff
it's natural
it's like a great athlete
like a jack nicklaus
he was always able to sink that putt
right
you know, he's just better
and you have athletes – very few – but there are some people that have a certain ability
a lot of people don't even know we have all the power
we have all the power in china
you know, we owe right now china and japan equally $1
5 – think of this – trillion
5 trillion
think of this
they take our business and in the case of japan, mostly cars
but they take our business
they take our jobs
factories close down all over the place
and we owe them money
right
it's a magic act
for them not for us
for us it's a horror show
it's going to end
it's going to end
and people like carl icahn and the people like the best negotiators – i know the best negotiators in the world
some i think are horrible people
i'll be honest with you
i don't care
do you care if they're horrible people
who cares
now, carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he's a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he's built a fortune
he doesn't want money
he doesn't want to say, oh, give me $200,000 a year in government money
he wants to do it
he's proud to do it
he wants to help the country
and it's so easy for him
for instance, if i say carl, do me a favor
the trade deal we have with china is so unfair we're losing $400 billion a year
carl, do me a favor
make it fair
i don't have to give him a big speech
i don't have to give him a big speech
i mean, i can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out
i mean, things will straighten out and it's going to be our benefit
but think of it, if we're losing that kind of money – that imbalance
it's an imbalance
some people will say that's not really a loss
it is a loss
if we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that's a lot of money
believe me, i couldn't sleep
if i brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right
but suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country
do you know the kind of money you're talking about
then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen
lots of great things would happen
and maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they'll have 75% and maybe they'll like them better
maybe they'll be better
and they'll be manufactured here
whenever i order television sets, i ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs
and whenever i order them, they all come from south korea
they make all the television – other than sony but sony has sort of lost its way a little bit
sony is japan
but south korea – lg, samsung
i don't get bids from american
i'd love to
i'd love to
george will said there's a company in south carolina that makes television
i said where are they
i'd like to have a good name too by the way
it's important
you know, when somebody's paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it's nice to see a good name
right
do we agree
well, it's a company in south carolina but they don't make them there
they assemble them
they'll order parts that come in and they'll assemble them
but much different
but i'd love it if we made them
but you take south korea
we defend south korea for essentially nothing
you have the maniac over in north korea that nobody ever talks about by the way
now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don't talk about him
we made the worst deal ever made with iran
right
the worst
these are the people that represent – these people are incompetent
or stupid
somebody said, you shouldn't say stupid
it's not nice
but it's true
they're stupid
i think
i mean, i think
unless i don't know is there something going on that we don't know about
think of it
point after point, we lost
we lost everything
we've given them $150 billion
hard to believe
they don't have to develop – i was telling somebody they don't have to develop nuclear weapon
they can buy it
what the hell why should they develop it
they can buy it
and now all of a sudden they're going into syria
they got so much money
they're a terrorist state
they're going into all of these different places
we're fighting them in yemen and yet we're making a deal with them
so why don't you say hey, yemen out
our prisoners – i want them back
i want them back
i don't want them over there
i want them back
and all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger
i'm the right messenger
you know, i've gotten to a point where i have to be braggadocious
it's terrible
right
because i can't be so nice and say we can all do a wonderful job
people can't do those kind of stuff
for instance, the wall
i said, i guarantee you that we're going to build a wall
it's going to be a real wall
we're going to have people come through and they're going to come through legally
or they're going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it
and we want people to come through
i want people to come through
i don't want to say no
but we have at least 11 million – you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many
you know, we've been hearing that number for years
you know, like 11 million
we have no idea
i spoke to one of the top people
they have no idea
might be 5 million
might also be 32 million
could be 50 …
but we have to get them out
we have to – look, it's harsh
dwight eisenhower – we all like dwight
right
remember the expression
right
i go remember he got elected – i like ike
how could he be bad
all right
and i think he was a nicer general than macarthur and patton
and i like ike as a president but i love patton and i love general macarthur
i love them
and we're going to find ourselves a patton and we're going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women
we're going to find ourselves a patton…but we're going to find a patton and we're going to find a macarthur
and i'm really good at that
we're going to find great people
and i've told this story where i watched these generals go on television – they shouldn't be on television
they shouldn't be talking
you know
they shouldn't be talking
they should be doing
and they asked a certain general, i'm not going to insult him
it was like a month and a half ago
on a show
a talk show
i said here's general so and so, one of the top, top, top people
i said what's he doing on television
and he's saying well, isis is very tough
you know, they spread out
by the way, they took the oil that i said take
remember i said take the oil
always take the oil
they're being funded by the oil that i said take
i don't want their damned oil
but you know what
it turned out to be another benefit of having it
take the oil
and we didn't do it
we shouldn't have been in iraq in the first place
and i said that in 2003
shouldn't have been there
we totally destabilized the middle east
we totally blew it
but we were there
then obama announces because he's so predictable we are leaving on a certain date in a year
right
i couldn't believe
i was sitting there thinking did he really say that
he said we will have all troops out by a certain date
right
did he say that
i said no, no, tell me please
…oh, you know what another one i got high marks on from every poll
military
they think i'll be the best in the military because they say i – you know, i always say i'll be the greatest jobs president that god ever created
i will
but everybody knows that, especially god
everybody knows that
but you know what i'll be
i'll be the great at the military
i'll be so good
and i'll know when – and i'll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody's going to mess around
we're never going to have to use it
we're never going to have to use it
and i'm going to take care of our vets
believe me, they're our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants
i'm going to take care of our vets
so go back
so the world is unpredictable
i made a business deal a year ago
and the guy – oh, i beat him so badly
aye, it was so beautiful
it was a beautiful thing
it was like a picture
for me, it was like a picture
that's my own problem
i guess
but to me it's like a painting when you could do something like that
so i made this deal and it was great
and they called
they did a story on me recently and it was a nice story
and i said, i hope they don't call this guy
they ended up calling this guy what do you think about trump
and he said but in a respectful way, he said he won because he was so damn unpredictable
we don't know what the hell he was going to do
that's a positive
that's a positive
i mean, if you're a poker player and you're predictable, you're not going home with much money
okay
but it was really – i said, that's not nice what he said
first, i said that's not nice
i'm unpredictable
then i said, wait a minute
he meant that as a compliment
and i called him
i said, what did you mean by that
he said i think that's the greatest compliment i can pay
we could not figure you out
you came at us from 15 different angles
so with obama, when he announces that we're leaving iraq on a certain date, we shouldn't have been there but once you announced the bad guys – you know how they say the surge worked
you know why the surge worked
you know why
because the bad guys all moved back
they said, hey, what do we have to get killed for
i mean, these people don't mind being killed, can you believe it
but they said if we don't have to, let's not
so they moved back
and they said, hey, they're leaving in - what was the date
do you remember the date
specific date to the day
we will have all troops out
i'm a great president
so the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, oh, you're leaving in a year
going to have all the troops out
let's go back
why do we have to be shot at for the next year
and what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he'll change his mind and stay
so let's let him think he has this great victory with the surge
right
the surge worked
what happened was that everybody pulled back
they said, let's wait
now we leave because of a lack of leadership
we leave and boom it comes apart
that's what happened
that was the surge
everybody talk so much – oh, the surge was so great
the surge was great because everybody knew – they knew what was happening
they knew it was going to happen
they knew we were leaving even through bush
i mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving
they were fed up
so they pulled back and they said, let's get them out
everybody wanted to leave
now, i would have done it differently
even if i wanted to leave and i might or i might not
i won't even say
people say, mr
trump, what's your attitude on isis
when will you attack them
where
i say you know, i don't want to talk – i have a real chance of winning
i don't want to tell you what my attitude
i want them to guess
i don't really want to tell you
i mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws
let's face it
hey, look at our leadership, it's got flaws
but you know the one bad thing
when i gave that answer, they say – although some people – i see it here – some people say we love that
we love that
but when i give that answer, some people say oh, trump doesn't know
he doesn't know
he didn't give an answer as to exactly what he's going to do
exactly what he's going to do
and i know exactly what i'm going to do and eventually after i was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, i said, you know, here's the problem
if i don't give the answer, i'm not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively
so if i don't give the answer, i'm not going to win
they're going to say trump wouldn't give us the answer
they don't know it's unpredictability
they don't know it's strategy
and i said for a period of time like a month, i said i don't want to tell you because i actually have a chance because from the time i announced, i've been on the top of the polls, almost at the top
you know, we're doing well
iowa, will you get your numbers up please
would you get these numbers up
i promise you i would do such a good job
first of all, i am a great christian and i am
i am
remember that
and i do well with the evangelicals
but the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month
i don't know what i did
but i am a great christian
i'm a believer and i believe in the bible
and i even brought my bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, mary, and with the address and the date – i won't tell you what date it was because possibly you'd think i'm younger than that
but she didn't want anybody taking my bible because that was very important to her
so cute
she has the address, has the date
but i said to myself, you know –
by the way, before i forget, will you get the numbers up iowa please
this is ridiculous
i mean, what is my competition
in all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition
do you think these guys – i'm not going to say carson – i'm not going to say rubio, who really is way down – i mean, i am second
it's not like it's terrible
but i don't like being second
second is terrible to me
but do you think that ben is going to go to china
these guys are fierce
like they'd come into your office
i've made many deals with china
i've had great victories in terms of deals with china
they come into your office
there's no hello
how are you
it's a wonderful day
they come in – we want deal
there's no games
i do this for a living
i'm really good at it, folks
really good
and you know, when you talk about energy, i'll tell you one thing, everybody agrees – oh, do i have energy
i toss and turn thinking about how i'm going to make the best deal for you folks
i'll be tossing and turning
i will be tossing and turning
you're going to have so many deals that is so good for you
we're going to have numbers are going to be so good
i always joke you may get tired of them but then i always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning
we don't win anymore
you know, think about it
do we win at all
ever
we lose with the military
isis beats us
everybody
we lose with trade
when are we going to come back and say, we beat china on a deal
when are we going to come back, we beat japan
do you know that everybody said oh, japan
they have so power over us
they have so much power because we owe them $1
5 trillion and they send all those cars
they have no power
if we ever say, listen, if you're not going to treat us fairly, we don't want your cars anymore, they'd go out of business, folks, they're gone
same thing with china
china is not even doing that well
but they just lowered, they just devalued their currency
the biggest in two decades
and the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, oh wow, we can get away with this and it's going to make it impossible
did you see the results yesterday of caterpillar tractor
horrible
because they're not getting stuff out because everybody – japan and china in particular – is devaluing their currency
that's their number one weapon
and the stupid trade deal that we're making doesn't even cover it
that's their number one weapon and the trade that we're making doesn't cover it
so i only say this and you know what
people might say it's terrible
he's a terrible person, a terrible human being
but i'm going to vote for him anyways
okay, that's fine
i'm actually a nice person
i always say this – nobody can do this stuff better than me
and i know all the guys i'm running against
they're wonderful people
some of them i really like
but who cares
i was talking to one of the candidates the other day
i was talking about corporate inversions and they didn't even know what the hell i was talking
they had no idea
it's not their thing
and unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we're being eaten alive
that's why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren't working
our real unemployment rate is probably 30%
it's not 5
that was done for politicians so they'd look good
it's not 5
how can you have 5
3% when you have 100 million people
you look for a job
if you're a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right there…but if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can't get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed
it's the most ridiculous thing
we have a tremendous – tens of millions of people in that position
they can't find jobs
they're good people
they want to work
they can't
but it's not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good
so let me just before we talk some questions, i'm going to talk about something i've never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it
it's called super pacs
it's one of the great scams of all time
it's one of the great scams
so we sent out – i think i had – and it's not me
people set them up
and i don't know
maybe they're setting up for my benefit
let's take me
a guy sees me, likes me, sets up a super pac
i don't talk to him
i don't do anything
i think we had either 9 or 5 or 11
we don't even know
they're all over the place
trump, trump – one of them called the art of the deal pac after the book
they have all these pacs
and the money comes in
and what do they do with the money
i don't know
and we aren't supposed to call them or anything
okay
so, we wrote a letter – a legal letter – to i think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don't want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it
if some guy that's having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a super pac, do you think he's going to take ads for trump
maybe and maybe not
so we sent them a – it's a scam, super pacs, a scam
it's a disgrace that we have
a disgrace
and i'll tell you i read a number with, as an example, with ben
ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money
so when you read he has all this money, he's paying a lot of money and that's not reflected yet
so when you hear they raised $20 million, they're paying – now think of it, who pays – the number i actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so i'm telling you it may be off but you all know it's a lot
i think they said, 79 cents on the dollar
think of it
to raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be
somebody is making a fortune
i know in romney's campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars
millions
they became rich raising money
it's better than being a real estate broker
for the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise
it's a scam
it's a scam
now, in ben's case, his super pac is running iowa
and let me tell you, the people that are running that super pac, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses
those are the bosses
in the case of jeb bush, you're not supposed to deal with these super pacs
okay
so, it was in the wall street journal the other day
he has a super pac fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom
did you read that
two ballrooms
one here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course
they're not supposed to be coordination
they're not supposed to be talking
they're right next to each other
and that's nothing compared to what some are doing
it's a scam and it should be stopped
and it's unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money
and what happened and i haven't talked about this before but i'm seeing what's going on
it's horrible what's going on
what happened is the last time they had the super pacs, i actually think there was sort of a wall
you know, they called it the wall
and this is a wall too
won't be as good as the one i'm going to build but it's a wall
but it was a wall and they didn't deal
i mean, even though like bush has a friend of his running his super pac, i'm sure they never talk
i'm sure
what do you think the chances are that they talk
100% or 99%
100%
i'd say 100%
i'd say 100%
only a foolish person would say 99%
but whatever
they're not supposed to
but they put a friend in there
they put other people in there
they put whoever
and that's the way it works
and in some cases, i hear in ben's case, i hear in other cases, they're literally running
i mean, had walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the super pac but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they're all doing
that's why he's out of the race because he couldn't figure it out
the whole thing with super pacs is a horrible, horrible scam
so i sent letters last week to as many as we could find
they're all over the place
we want you to close the super pac
we want nothing to do with it
we don't want to get advertisements
we don't want any of the money
go home and ideally give the money back
they don't even have to give the money back from what i understand
they can keep it
they'll probably if they actually raised money for me, they'll say what a horrible thing he just said
i think we're going to support somebody else
they could do that
but the super pacs have total control over the people running for office
total
nothing over me
nothing
i feel it's very unfair
i feel it's a very unfair situation
now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything…but what are they doing with this whole thing
and i think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest
but the super pacs are controlling your candidates – some more than others
some are unbelievable
and what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left
when you read that ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign
you'll be amazed
i mean, it's so little
bush, it's the same thing
and i'll go over – there are other names
i know every one of them
but it's a horrible thing that's taking place
and again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions
now, they're not even going through the motions
they're not even going through
and just remember when i have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when i have to do that, you know, john deere, i paid them tens of millions of dollars
you can even check
i said to john deere, i want an endorsement
i don't know if they'll give me an endorsement
i'll tell you if they don't they're not so smart
i guarantee no other person gave john deere – i mean, i bought probably more than $10 million worth of john deere equipments
i love it
you know why
iowa
iowa
i love it
i love it
when we can
by the way, it's a great company
it's a great company
but i buy a lot of stuff from john deere because i have a lot of big developments that really require john deere type equipment
i don't have to buy it from them
i could buy it from others
but i want to steer it to them when i can
but we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it's crooked stuff
it's crooked stuff
and it's got to stop
and it's very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you're supposed to do it, including me
i think i'm the only one that's self-funding
i'm the only one putting up my own money, other than – i know it's precious – people write in to donaldjtrump
com or whatever and they send me checks like $20
i keep saying the woman for $7
50, $50, $100
i don't want their money
but if you send it back it's totally insulting
i mean, they always write letters too
they write these beautiful letters – mr
trump, i can't afford much and i know you don't need it but i'm sending $50 because that's so important what you're saying about the country
it's beautiful
i mean, i've seen such beautiful letters
and if i send it back, there's no letter i can write that's not going to be insulting to those people, really
dear mr
so and so or mrs
so and so, i don't need your money and thanks a lot but we're going to do it ourselves
if i got that back, i'd say who the hell does he think he is
so we take that and it's something that i think is important
so i always preface it by saying i don't consider that funding but i'm self-funding my campaign and i'm getting ready to put up millions, millions
and something i'm very proud of that i think it's great and it's you know really great, it hasn't gotten very much publicity, hasn't gotten much publicity, but i have spent less money than any other candidate
okay
by far
i think
i don't know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around…but i was told that i spend less
and i have the best results because in most polls i'm number one
now, until iowa came along, i said every poll, and then iowa – what the hell are you people doing to me
you know
you know
i'm telling you
they said, why don't you skip iowa
they told me that
everybody said skip iowa
all of the political geniuses
a man just interviewed me back there, great reporter
he's actually a great reporter
of course, if he writes a bad story, i won't say that
but he is
he's a great reporter
and he said, would you ever think of maybe skipping iowa going right to new hampshire
and then you'd go to south carolina where i'm leading by massive – yeah, you've got to see the rallies there
they're incredible
but you'd go to new hampshire
you'd go to south carolina
you go to nevada
you go to the scc
i said i can't do that because i have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from iowa that i think we're going to win
i really do
i believe it
i believe it
and i don't want to skip iowa
i think we're going to do well
i think we're going to do great with evangelicals
i think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and i think i'm going to do great with the evangelicals because i am the real deal
i will tell you that
i'm the real deal
so i told these political pros, you know, i hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the republican circuit, the person that won iowa did not get the nomination
okay
i want to take away some of your muster
you understand that
so could we do – and please do me a favor
let me win iowa
and then i'm going to win, i'm telling you we're going to win new hampshire, and we're going to win south carolina
a great poll just came out on north carolina just a little while
a ppp poll
it was great
some of you saw that
but great poll
but we're going to go on and we're going to win
we're going to win
and actually, one of the pundits – because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits
a lot of pundits said he'll never run
he's not going to run
they're still trying to recover
but one of the very smart one says if trump wins iowa, it's over
it's interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great
and i thought it was good here
come on
okay, so that's the end of that
but i want to tell you, will you – i refuse to say get your asses in gear
i will not say that
i will not say it
i will not say it because i don't want to use anything that's even a little bit off
so will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on feb
1stand vote and give us a victory
and if i win iowa, we're going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we're going to have such a great military and we're going to take care of our health care without that crazy obamacare that's a nightmare
so, i'm sticking with you people
i'm going to spend money here
i have a great team over here
and i will tell you i'm going to spend a lot of time here and i really want to win iowa and i think we should and it's so important
and you know, it's about time that iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory
okay
not like over the last – right
so, i love you all
i mean, we're having fun
but i love you all
but i do mean it
i'm going to stay here
we're going to work really hard
when i heard the poll today, they said what are you going to do
i said, i'm going to work harder in iowa
i'm not leaving iowa
i'm not leaving iowa
now, if i lose iowa, i will never speak to you people again
that i can tell you
okay, let's do a couple of questions
right
come on
…you know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country
now, you look like you're doing pretty well in all fairness
but still, we have 50 million
we have 46 million people and they're getting food stamps
46 million
think of it
you know, we talk about how well we're doing
so we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it's got to end
one of the problems – we don't have enough jobs in this country
it's very simple
you know, it's so simple when you think about it
our jobs have been taken away
and i'll tell you what else, middle income folks – their salaries haven't gone up in 12 years
people are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago
and other things have gone up
so they're really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago
but that's an amazing stat
but people – one of the reasons they say i'm doing so well because i let people know we're going to bring jobs back
we're going to bring industry and plants
we're going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that
we're going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they're working
then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs
i have some people that i know very well and they've had a job for 20 years at the same place
all of a sudden they're working part-time because of obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better
they love the owners, the stores and things
they love the owners
they think the owners are great
but the owners are forced to make part-time jobs
they have part-time jobs
they work all their life
they have a wonderful company that they're working for, and now all of a sudden they're cut into part-time jobs because of obamacare because of the rulings of obamacare
and you all know what i'm talking about
so they end up being part-time workers and they don't want to be part-time workers
they don't even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker
and we're not going to have that stuff anymore
we're not going to have it any more
we're going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up
believe me
the numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that's a shame
…tell you what, as president, i can guarantee it
as trump, i can say i'll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won't stop
it'll be easier to take todd and just say, look, we're going to work with you, todd
okay
so will you get me that number and everything and we'll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here
you have problems with the va also, huh
terrible
i hear only – i just hear terrible
and we're going to solve that problem
you know, it can be solved
the waits now for the va are longer than they've ever been…the waits now are worse than they've ever been
thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor
okay, dying
and you find the same thing, you say
you have to use your own because they won't do anything
so we're going to take care of our vets and we're going to take care of the va and it's going to be one of the things we're going to be releasing pretty soon
but one of the things we're going to do with the va, we have a lot of hospitals that aren't doing any business
we have a lot of private doctors that could do more business
we're losing a lot of our doctors because of obamacare
they're retiring
they're leaving
one of them – a friend of mine – said i have more nurses working for me now more than before but i have more accountants and the end result is a disaster
he's getting out of the business
he's got nurses but he's got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy
so one of the things we're going to do is if todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait – because the waits are unbelievable – 5, 6, 7 days sometimes
they're going to a private doctor
they're going to go to a private hospital
or a public hospital that's in the area
and we're going to pay for that and it's going to cost less money – it's going to cost less money than the system we have now – and you're going to end up getting much better care
it's going to cost less and you're going to get better care…
so the keystone pipeline, first of all, i'd approve it because it's thousands of jobs
okay
i would approve it so fast, so fast
and hillary should have approved it
you know, hillary wanted to approve it but she's been dragged so far left, that's she's – forget it
it's a disaster
so i would approve it
but with that being said, i may want to make a better deal because you know what
we're bringing oil from canada
right
i may say, i want 10%
we're going to approve it but i want 10%, 15%
because the truth is that the keystone pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy
and it's great stuff
we have really great quality, higher than canada
you know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them
very expensive to get it out
we have great stuff
so i would approve it because i love the jobs of building it
i love the jobs of building it
but i may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land
you know, maybe we should do that
so i'm going to look into that
but when i approve it – i'll tell you what, when i approve it, it'll be a great deal for the united states
it won't be like – because right now, what we're doing is we're approving it, we're not really getting anything
they're putting it underground, and that's actually good environmentally
better than having trucks going down the road and everything else
that's good environmentally
but we're not getting – we're not getting – anything much for it
when i get finished with the keystone, they'll be happy and we'll be happy
okay
well, i'll tell you in all fairness, ben carson said yesterday or the other day that he wants to abolish medicare
okay
and you know what a disaster that is
now, i'm sure at some point, he'll take it back
but he said he wants to abolish medicare and one thing, people do like their medicare
they do like it
and you are bringing up a point that i've heard before
we're going to look at a lot of different things
but we're going to save social security, we're going to save medicare and that's the way it is
okay
we're not abolishing like other people
okay, it's a lot of people but you know what
it's costing us $200 billion a year immigration in this country right now
and dwight eisenhower is going to say he moved 1
5 million in the 1950s, early 1950s, moved them out
we have tremendous illegal immigration problems
dwight eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1
5 million people out of the united states
and you know what happened
he moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back
they moved them a third time, they came right back
and then you know they were tougher in those days
they moved them all the way south – all the way south – and they didn't come back
now, we have to do it
we have no choice
we either have a country or we don't
and i want them to come back
but i want them to come back with papers
i want them to come back legally
i want them to come back
the good ones
the good ones
but only the good ones
we got some bad ones
remember the heat i took with illegal immigration
remember that heat
for two weeks
rush limbaugh said he has received more incoming than any human being i've ever seen
and then he double-downed…
you know what
i took a lot of heat and then you had kate in san francisco, killed, shot in the back and so many others
and people started looking
and let me tell you, we have some wonderful people over here and they're here illegally but they're wonderful people
okay
and we'll try to get them back real soon and we'll do it through a legal process
but we also have some really bad gang members
you know, some of the gangs in la
they're made up of illegal immigrants
and we have unbelievable police forces that don't get the respect that they should get
they don't get it
i mean, what they go through, it's unbelievable
they're afraid to talk to anybody
they don't want to lose their jobs
they don't want to lose their pensions
they can't talk
now, let me just tell you something
you can always have bad apples
in this room, we have a couple of bad apples
okay
i don't know who they are or where they are but you do
probably mostly back there in the press
but the police do an unbelievable job
and they know the gangs
you go to la the la cops
you got chicago, the chicago cops
these people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs
but they're not allowed to do their jobs
and we're going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they're not coming back and i don't want to put them in our jails because i don't want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years
i don't want them in our jails
we have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails
i don't want them in our jails
i heard a couple of these candidates saying, well, they're –  they're such babies
but you know what
they're talking about putting them in jail
well, i don't want them
our jails are over-brimming
i want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be there
okay
and i don't want to put these really bad dudes – i mean, they are bad – i don't want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years
okay
and we're going to deal very humanely with the good people and they are mostly good people
but we've got some real bad ones and they're out of here
your head will spin probably
somebody said the other day, what's the first thing you're going to do
well, we're going to work immediately on repealing obamacare
you know, the one good thing about executive orders
the one good thing
you know, obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in
come in
we have great border patrol people
i got to know them a couple of months ago when i went down to texas to the border
they're great people
they're not allowed to do their job
they stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them
they want to do their job
they're not allowed to
so the executive order that president obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, i will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders
they'll be revoked
the only good thing
it's actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that's the end of that
so we're going to clean up our border
we're going to make it fantastic
we're going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen
we will support israel 1,000%
israel feels so left alone and i know bibi and a lot of my friends are from israel and they feel so left out
and so many people say, you know, i have so many jewish friends where they say why did i support obama
i think he's the worst thing that's ever happened to israel
and we will support israel beyond anything they ever have before
okay
that's an easy one
that's the easiest question of the night
…the wall is a big factor
60%, 70%
the drugs are a great question
we are going to stop drugs
look, i told you before – mexico – $45 to $50 billion
that's not including the drugs
the drugs that are coming across the border are beyond belief
did you see the picture last week where they had a little wall this big and they built a ramp for trucks to go over it with trucks
did you see the picture
they think we're playing games
and mexico is not helping us
mexico is not helping
do you know if you want to become a citizen of mexico – i love the mexican people
i have many mexican people and hispanics working for me
in nevada, i'm number one
i'm rated number one in the polls with the hispanics
everyone's shocked
because the hispanics that are here legally, those people they want me, they know i'm going to bring jobs and everything else
they don't want people pouring in
but i will tell you mexico has got to help us
you know, if you want to become a citizen of mexico…do you know it's one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of
and yet, people pour right through into us, into us
they call us the dumb americans
that's what they call us because of our leaders
they call us the dumb americans
if you want to become a citizen of mexico, you could take the best person in this room, the most qualified, you're not going to do it
they don't do that
and if you're there illegally and if you overstay your bound
you're not going to be there illegally
but if you have a pass for two weeks and you overstay your bound, they have cops waiting for you
they have police that say, you know you have one day left
i hear it's unbelievable
i'm impressed actually
because to a certain extent, that's the way it's supposed to be
but if you want to become a citizen of mexico, it's impossible
they don't have anchor babies in mexico
you're born a baby in mexico, it's like bye-bye
here, you're born over here, oh, congratulations we're taking care of the baby for 85 years
not going to happen
it's not going to happen
no, it's not going to happen
by the way, this is important, i sort of lucked into this one
the 14th amendment
it says right there – you know, everybody says you have to go through a whole process, it'll take many years, you have to go through every state
you have to do another amendment
it's wrong
14th amendment covers it
and some of the best legal minds in the world say trump is right
i said, what
i am
i didn't know
i lucked into it
every once in a while you luck
the fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby, we're not responsible
now, we may have a court case but we're going to win it
and a simple act of congress gets rid of it
and a lot of people didn't know that
okay
and the reason i said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that
how could it be possible
and we're one of the only countries where that takes place
and honestly, i use mexico as an example because they're so tough
if that happens in mexico, they don't even know what you're talking about
what are you talking about
but with us
no good
not going to happen anymore
well, you know, the amazing thing is that the politicians in this country live by a whole different standard when it comes to health care, when it comes to everything they have including what you just said about social security
our politicians live by a different standard and i think that shouldn't happen
and some of them tried to do it
you know the story in obamacare, they don't have to take it
they live by a different standard
and that's not going to happen
everybody's going to live by the same standard
they're going to have the same standard as the poorest person in this room
that's the way it's going to be
it's a good question
but do you know if i answer that question, we'd have a big, big story
you know that, right
you know, i'll tell you, it is a question that's asked a lot
i know a lot of good people
a couple of people on the stage that i really respect, i've gotten to respect
but the truth is too early
i like to get things done first
we've got to close the deal
i don't want to think about it
there are a lot of good people
there are a lot of good people
we've got to close the deal
we've got to get it done
and to get it done, i want iowa
so good luck everybody
thank you very much
i love you
i love you
thank you
and we'll be back
thank you
so, we're going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again
it's a tax reform that i think will make america strong and great again
too few americans are working
too many jobs are being shipped overseas
and too many middle income families cannot make ends meet
this plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business
it will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other americans
there will be a major tax reduction
it will simplify the tax code
it will grow the american economy at a level it hasn't seen for decades
and all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit
but i will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we've got to make our economy strong
changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven't seen in a long time
we're going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4
simplification
25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%
if you're single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 – so, very important
if you're single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you'll not pay any income tax – nothing
this eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty
very unfair penalty
it eliminates the amt, which is the alternative minimum tax
it ends the death tax
it's a double taxation
a lot of families go through hell over the death tax
it reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich – in other words, it's going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true – while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions
very importantly
it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest
those are the hedge fund folks that i've been talking about for quite a while
they make a lot of money
carried interest
so it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital
changes for business – now, so important, because it's all about business
it's all about jobs
we have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work
they can't work
so for business, no business of any size from a fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes
big reduction
a one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount – 10%
so it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad
now, it's called corporate inversion
it's a huge subject
i've been watching politicians now for years – all talk, no action politicians
i've been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back
the number is probably $2
5 trillion
everybody agrees it should come back – republicans, democrats, everybody
they can't make a deal
they don't know how to go about making a deal
the reason companies aren't bringing it back is the tax is onerous
it doesn't make sense to bring it back
and in fact, many companies are leaving the united states
they're leaving our shores to go and collect their money
they're going actually moving out of the united states for two reasons – the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can't bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in
it's called leadership
we will have that money brought back in
as an example, i have millions of dollars overseas
i can't bring it back into this country
we filed papers
we've been doing this for a year and a half
we can't get it back in
so the money stays in other countries and that's what happens
not good for us
the level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important
but this is something – and i've been watching it for a long time – everybody agrees to
we also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes – many of them actually – and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income
the tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don't make sense, and which are unfair are gone
and we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense
so we are going to give you – we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex
and we're going to hand them out right now to the press
and i think you'll see we have an amazing code
it will be simple
it will be easy
it will be fair
it's graduated
as you get up in income, you pay a little more
some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer
but i actually believe they'll do better because i think the economy will grow
it will grow rapidly
and we'll have something very special
now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what's going on in this country
if you look at what we're doing and the money we're spending
i read where a washer – you know what a washer is
nuts, bolts, and washer – to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there
and there are many examples
hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money
we will run this country properly
there is so much money to be saved
we're reducing taxes but at the same time if i win, if i become president, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country
we won't be losing anything other than we'll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be
so, this is a plan that's simple, that's a major reduction
i think people are going to be very happy
we've already had some very good reviews
i did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country
they love it
they say why hasn't this been done before
and this is my wheelhouse
that's what i do well
the economy is what i do well
whenever they do polls, i always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but i won't say that
so, if anybody has –  – thank you
that's amazing
that's some of the press was actually clapping
i've never saw – i don't think i've ever seen that before
all right
why don't we take some questions from the press
no, i'm not going to do that yet but we have their approval
but we have some of the top people in the country worked on this
well, we're looking at a 3% but we think it can be 5%, it could even be 6%
we're going to have growth that will be tremendous
and by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular
and one of the things that they don't take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting
there is so much waste in government and i believe when i get in there i'll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the – and we're not even showing anything for that
so, they're very conservative numbers
my taxes will – first of all, i'll have a much simpler tax statement
it will be much simpler
when i do my return, it will be much – my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous
and you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else
we want to simplify them to a tremendous level
the bracket of 25% – the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all – they've been there for years – are antiquated in many cases
or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to hillary, they're contributing to bush
they're contributing to every candidate but trump
because i'm not taking any money
i'm self-funding
and these people want these deductions
there will be people – we're reducing taxes
but believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won't be thrilled with this
we're taking away deductions and that's one of the reasons we're able to lower it
this is actually a tax reduction
a big tax reduction, including for the upper income
i believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won't be getting certain deductions which aren't fair for them to be getting that they'll end up doing better
i just think this is a common sense approach
you know, we could say supply side
you could say there's 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases
i don't think it's supply side or anything else
i think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that's going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work
it's going to create tremendous numbers of jobs
one of the other things that i'm coupling this with is if i become president, i'm going to renegotiate our trade deals
because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country
not sustainable
we cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries
there's not a country that we negotiate with that doesn't make a better deal
everybody
we lose money with everything
i'm also going to renegotiate some of our military costs
because we protect south korea, we protect germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world – saudi arabia – we protect everybody
we protect everybody
and we don't get reimbursement
we lose on everything
we lose on everything
so, we're going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that's going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly
i'm not showing a big number in that
but i believe that if i become president, those numbers are going to be massive
as an example, saudi arabia
they make $1 billion a day
we protect them
so we need help
we're losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion
i used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months
now it's $19 trillion and it's only going up
well, no, look
senator  rubio is a lightweight
we understand that
he wouldn't be able to do this
he wouldn't know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they're trying to take – we just went up in the last poll
we went up two points in the last poll, and we continue to go up
in the nbc poll, i think we went from 26% to 29%
we're going up very strongly in the polls
they don't know what to do about it
i've built a great company
you'll see that in 60 minutes last night
i built a great company
it's a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow
i'm funding my own campaign
guys like rubio, i mean, he desperately needs money
ask the car dealer in florida
ask the people that support him
and a guy like rubio and others – i don't want to single him out
you're singling him out – but they're largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists
i've turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it's not the right thing
it's just not right
and that seems to be resonating very strongly
i negotiate
it's true
i get bills from people
i'll negotiate
oh, is that a bad thing
the country should do that
yeah, i would
i'd bring that same attitude to the white house
it's true
she says i have a habit when you get a bill, you'd call up and you negotiate
to me, that's a compliment
no, i want to take that thinking to the white house
i would bet you we could save 20% of our budget
i could even save more
but we could save a tremendous amount
that has to be the attitude our country has
you can't spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000
you know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field
okay
a soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in guantanamo
okay
i don't like that
what do you need $1 million for
level out the surface, let them play – if they had to play at all
okay
what do you need to spend $1 million
we just spent – it's a story today
$1 million on a soccer field
how do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field
you have a level piece of land
throw them a ball if they have to play soccer – if they have to play at all
why are they playing soccer is my question
no, it's too long
you don't have time
you don't have time
no, not at all
we're lowering taxes, which republicans love
and i think one of the reasons i am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons i'm doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking
no, we're lowering taxes very substantially
we're simplifying
and we're getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons
so, no, that's not true
well, putin was interviewed and i was interviewed last night
i thought his interview – i though charlie rose did an excellent job
but i thought his was a softer interview
scott pelley interviewed me
i thought scott was terrific
i mean, it was a tough interview but i thought he was very fair and i thought the piece was very good
why is he harder on me than putin
i would say because putin is a nicer person than i am
the worst in 36 years
well, it's a good question and you can connect the dots
but i guess it has been probably since '04
you know, you're talking about 10, 11, 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country
and again it's called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they're going to other countries, taking jobs
and now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies – very large, very prestigious companies as you know – obviously you know something about business
but we have major companies looking to move out of the united states
you know, it used to be they'd move from new york to florida
they'd move from new jersey to texas
or whatever
now, they're talking about moving from the united states to ireland and to england and to other places, to spain where they get treated differently and frankly better
and they're doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons – one of the big reasons – as you know is taxes
one of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they've built up and they can't get back into our country
and when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it's going to be put to work in our country, largely
it can go other places
but largely
and i think it will be an amazing boon
now, here's the other thing
they think it's $2
5 trillion
i think it's much more than that
i actually think it's going to be more money than that
and boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt
well, you know when you end the repatriation, when you get the money coming back in beyond, tremendous things happen
well, i'll be announcing that in the not too distant future
but i will tell you
i've been honest
i'm the only one that's honest about this thing
i watched romney
i watched all – oh, i pay so much tax
i pay so much tax
i watched all politicians and they say i pay –
i fight like hell to pay as little as possible
can i say that
i'm not a politician
i fight like hell always because it's an expense
and you know, i feel – i fight
i have the best lawyers and the best accountants and i fight
and i pay
but it's an expense
and frankly, i would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain
our country spends our money so stupidly and i will tell you that i could speak for myself i pay a lot of tax but i fight like hell to make it as low as possible
but i would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that i respected the decisions
all you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don't feel so good about our country
i'll tell you what in terms of income inequality, we're going to create a lot of jobs
you know, right now, we have a false – 5
4%, 5
3%, 5
6% – every month it's different
it's such a phony number
because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they're taken off the roll
so the number isn't reflective
i've seen numbers of 24%
i actually saw a number of 42% unemployment
42%
and it could be because when you're looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can't get the job – you know what i'm talking about because you're shaking your head – and you can't get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed
so then i read every time it comes out i hear 5
3% unemployment
that is the biggest joke there is in this country
that number is so false
and you know, people ask how come trump is doing so well
and carson and others
how come they're doing -
you know why they're doing well
because people are tired of political speak
they're tired of that
and the worst example of it – one of the worst example of it – is the phony unemployment rate
the unemployment rate is probably 20%
but i will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it's 30%, 32%
and the highest i've heard so far is 42%
there's anger out there at the job picture
now, one of the things – with that being said, china, japan, mexico, brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like we're a bunch of babies
that will stop
people will treat us fairly if i become president
we're losing our jobs
we're losing our base
we're losing our manufacturing
all of that will stop
well, this is number one a simplification
number two, what i'm really doing is the big picture because corporations now are going to start having an incentive to create jobs
they're going to have an incentive also to stay in this country
…well, if they provide bigger dividends, people are going to have more money to spend
so that's not so bad either
if a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, that's great
jones gets a bigger dividend, he's going to have more money to spend in the economy
so that's good
i know nothing about that
no, i'm not a populist
no, i'm not
i'm a man of great common sense
i'm a man that's built a tremendous company with the best locations in real estate, the best everything
you're here at one of them
i have many of these
i've done a great job
i've employed tens of thousands of people
i employ now thousands and thousands of people
i've done a good job
but i wouldn't say populist at all
i would say i'm a man of common sense
i'm cutting taxes
i'm going to create a lot of jobs
i'm going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste
and i'll tell you what
the waste that i get rid of – the waste that i get rid of – is going to have a huge impact and i'm not even putting that in my numbers so i think it's going to be terrific
yes, the motor industry
that's a beautiful way of describing it – the motor industry
where are you from
england
i love them
oh, what a beautiful accent
no, i want to get the industry – we call it the automobile industry
but i want to get the automobile industry to build factories here
as you know, ford is building $2
5 billion factory in mexico
mexico also took a big plant out of tennessee and tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn't
i want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the united states
i don't want nabisco leaving for mexico or any place else
i want these companies not to leave chicago, not to leave michigan, not to leave new hampshire and iowa and south carolina and all of these places where they're leaving and they're going to other countries
i want them to stay here and they will stay here and they'll be so happy
ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
it's been a great honor
thank you
autism has become an epidemic
25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics
not even close
it has gotten totally out of control
i am totally in favor of vaccines but i want smaller doses over a longer period of time
because you take a baby in – and i've seen it and i've seen it and i had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount
but you take this little beautiful baby and you pump – i mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse not for a child
and we've had so many instances – people that work for me just the other day – two years old, two and a half years old, a child – a beautiful child – went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic
i only say – i'm in favor of vaccines
do them over a longer period of time
same amount but just in little sections
and i think you're going to have – i think you're going to see a big impact on autism
…boy, oh, boy
i didn't expect that
you know, joe  and the group  called and they said would you come over and speak
i'm here for a certain reason
you know, it's called tomorrow night
so i got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words
an endorsement from your group with so many veterans – hundreds of thousands of veterans – i really appreciate that, joe
i did not expect that
i didn't expect it
i didn't ask for it
i will say this
i am with the veterans 100%
they're our greatest people
they're being treated terribly
not only the number of deaths, which are obviously – that's what's going on is incredible
but as of two weeks ago on wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the veterans administration
you go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days
and it's not going to happen
not going to happen
if i win, believe me, it's not going to happen
and one of the things i thought i'd do and i'd stress so strongly – the veterans hospitals – obviously they have problems
they're not properly run
and when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say i'm sorry
i'm going on vacation, believe me, it doesn't get much worse than that
so we're going to create a whole new system
we're going to take this system apart
and if they're not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we're going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals
and you're going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it
and that's going to be broken down into something that's going to be very special
right now – and you know it – we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans
it's not going to happen anymore
it's not going to happen
so, joe, i just really appreciate it
so unexpected
to be here is an honor
they don't build ships like this anymore, folks
you know
we don't do them this way anymore
i actually said what about recommissioning – look at this thing
the largest guns in the world
the most powerful guns
i learned about the iowa
by the way, iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons
you know
we have been treated so well in the state of iowa
it's been incredible
number one on the polls and we love those people
they're great
so this is a great ship and that's a great state
i just want to say that we're going to come out with some plans in a very short time
we're going to be building up our military
we're going to make our military so big and so strong and so great
and it will be so powerful that i don't think we're going to ever have to use it
nobody's going to mess with us
that i can tell you
and we're going to have a president who's respected by putin, who's respected by iran
you know, let's talk about for two seconds, let's talk about the iran deal
now, obama and his people call him the supreme leader of iran
obama talks about the supreme leader
well, i'm not calling him a supreme leader
but he said the other day that after this rip-off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the united states again
we're finished with the united states
they're taking $150 billion
they're getting a deal that's going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think
they're going to self-police – think about that one – they are going to go and self-police
they've got the 24-day – they have 24-day provisions
and by the way, what people don't understand – the 24-day provision doesn't start – you know this, right
it doesn't start for a long time before you even get to it
the clock is ticking
it can take forever
we may never get it there
it is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts i've ever seen of any kind
so, we are going to do things and this country right
we're not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there's still there and we don't even ask for them
one of them is there because he's a christian
we have a writer
we have – the whole thing is absolutely insane
you know, they asked the president, and they asked secretary of state kerry who maybe – you know, i've been saying hillary clinton is the worst secretary of state in the history of this country
right
all right
i've been saying it
but it's possible – the world blew up around her
it blew up
just blew up
the whole world is like a different place
it's possible that because of this deal made by secretary kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he's going to supersede
and i understand that he may want to run for president
he has no chance like she has no chance
so we're going to see what happens
we have many problems in our country
one of them is immigration
now, i took a tremendous hit when i brought up illegal immigration when i announced i was running for president
and for two weeks, i said – you know, rush limbaugh – he's a great guy – he said he has suffered more incoming – meaning the press – than anybody i've seen
so what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and i am so happy that i'm the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it's a big problem
it is a big problem
so you remember for about two weeks, i said, boy this is tougher than i thought running for president
and then you found out there's tremendous crime
there's tremendous drugs pouring across the border
tremendous
beyond
going to chicago, going to new york, going to la, going all over our country
so the drugs pour in and the money pours out
not a good deal
we get the drugs, they get the money
the drug cartels are going wild
they cannot believe how stupid our government is
they are making a fortune
the drugs come in
the money goes out daily
and i saw it because i was on the border
i was there
and we saw it
and everybody sees it everyday
and we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership
none
none whatsoever
so, we're going to build a wall and mexico's going to pay for the wall, believe me
you know, a lot of politicians have said oh, they're not going to pay
they don't know anything about – they never read the art of the deal, first of all
so here's the story
so here's the story
i said the other day to one of my people what is the united state's trade deficit with mexico, japan, and china
so let's start with china
almost $400 billion a year
now, if you have a company where you're losing $400 billion, you've got to do something very fast
we don't
we've been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades
not going to happen anymore
not going to happen anymore
with japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right
they drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars – millions of cars – and we sell them beef
we sell them beef
and they don't want it because their farmers don't want our beef
they protest and they send it back
all right
it's not going to happen that way anymore
now, with mexico – and i love mexico
i have many, many people – many, many people from mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments
same with china
i have so many people
they pay me millions and millions
what am i supposed to hate china because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment
i don't think so
i had the largest bank in the world as a tenant
it's from china
bigger than any bank in this country by many times
they're from china
the problem that we have is that the leaders of mexico, japan, and china and every other country that we do business with, they're smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders
i love free trade
the concept is great
but you need smart people
i have the smartest people in this country lined up
i know the smartest
i have carl icahn
i have the best business leaders and they all want to do it
they're wealthy because they make good deals like me
i make good deals
you know, it's a talent
it's a talent
you can't be a politician
look, i'm fighting some very nice people
very nice
even though i'm leading in the polls
but they're very nice people
but they're never going to do anything with these countries
they're never going to be able to do it
it's an instinct
it's something that's special
they don't have it
believe me, they don't have it
it's just going to be more of the same
so, we are going to make our country so great
we are going to make it strong
we are going to make it powerful
we're going to rebuild the military
we're going to make it so strong
we are going to take care of our veterans
and in the end, in the end, i want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day
the other week – two weeks ago in mobile, alabama, 31,000 people showed up in a rainy rough day
31,000 people came to see us speak and we're talking about making america great again
last night in dallas at the american airlines center, 20,000 people – the basketball arena of the mavericks
20,000 people showed up and i want to tell you, it was a love fest
everybody – think of it, 20,000 people – there wasn't one heckler in the whole room
i kept saying, there's got to be one
there was a word – two words that used to be used a lot called silent majority
they stopped using them
the silent majority, believe me, is back and i think we can use it somewhat different
i don't think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they're not silent
people are not silent
they're disgusted with our incompetent politicians
they're disgusted with the people that are giving our country away
they're disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job
they're disgusted when they're allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they're standing there helpless and people just pour into the country
they're disgusted when a woman who's nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years
they're disgusted by what's happening to our country
and you're going to look around and you're going to remember who the people are that are here because we're doing something special
this is a movement
we're going to make our country great again
believe me, we will make our country great again
i love you all
thank you very much
thank you very much, everybody
thank you all for being here
this is some turnout
my great honor
the chairman just left as you probably know and he's been extremely fair
the rnc has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period
and as you know, that's what i've wanted
i wanted fairness
i don't have to be treated any differently than anybody else
i just wanted fairness from the republican party
we're leading in every single poll
a new poll came out today where we're over 30%
we've actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%
and frankly, i've felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the democrats and very easily i think beat the democrats no matter who it may be whether it's hillary or anybody else and i think maybe hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what's happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the republicans to win is if i win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up
and for that reason, i have signed the pledge
so i will be totally pledging my allegiance to the republican party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win
we will win
and most importantly, we will make our country great again because that's what it's all about
we have to make our country great again
this is a self-funded campaign
we have our heart in it
we have our soul in it
i don't need money and i don't want money
and this is going to be a campaign like i think no other
i'm not controlled by lobbyists
i'm not controlled by anybody
i'm controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again
yeah, i got nothing
i really got nothing
the question was what did i get for signing the pledge
absolutely nothing
other than the assurance that i would be treated fairly
and i've seen that over the last two months
they really have been very fair
no, i have no intention of changing my mind
well, i think the big thing that's changed is – and it's been obvious to all – number one, after i announced, we went up like a rocket ship
nobody thought i was going to run and they said oh, he won't run and he won't put in his papers
and he wouldn't do all of this
i did that
the papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular
it's a great company
i built a great company
and all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received
and i think the thing that's changed is the fact that i went to number one place very quickly after i signed and after i in this building notified everybody that i'd be running for president
so i think the biggest thing is that i went early to number one and the rnc has treated me with great respect
so that was very important
no, i see no circumstances under which i would tear up that pledge
well, you don't have to be met when you're at 2%
it's one of those things
that's the way life works
and i like gov
christie, by the way
well, the chairman asked if he could come up
you saw him
he was here a little while ago
and i was greatly honored that he did come up frankly
well, i think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks english and i think that while we're in this nation, we should be speaking english
and that's how assimilation takes
and that's how – i mean, whether people like it or not that's how we assimilate and that's how we go on to that next phase and that next stage
and that's how people that don't speak – and i'm not just talking about spanish
i'm talking about from various parts of the world – that's how they will become successful and do great
so i think it's more appropriate to be speaking english
well, one of the things i want to do and i feel very strongly it's a country based on borders and our country is based on laws
and when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that
and this is not from south america
this is not from mexico
this is from all over the world
when people come illegally, we cannot allow that
and i want people to come legally
i want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess
that's been proven
and interestingly, a couple of months ago when i announced, i made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and i've been proven right
and many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which i very much appreciate
of course, they haven't done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will
the fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders
we're a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws
and we will make sure that that takes place
with that being said, i want people to come into our country legally
i want to have a big, fat beautiful open door
i want people of great talent to come in for silicon valley
i want engineers
i want physicists
i want people with great talent to come into the united states
when people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at harvard or number one at yale or the wharton school of finance or princeton or stanford
and immediately if you're not a citizen of the united states, you get thrown out of the country
we want those people to stay
we want people of great talent to be in the united states to work here and ultimately to become a citizen
i don't know enough about it to comment on it
was she jailed
i really don't know much about it
that's absolutely false
i win at golf
i win at golf
that i can tell you
well, i understand how the system works maybe better than anybody
i understand the political system and i understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants
don't forget if i didn't bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn't be asking the question
nobody would be even talking about immigration
and immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor
now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since i brought it up
but if i didn't bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we're talking about and it happens to be a very important subject
i have to say this
it can also be a very positive subject because i believe so strongly in immigration and i just – we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner
but if i didn't bring it up, nobody would be talking about it
well, there is gridlock in congress right now and that's because there's no leadership at the top
you have to be able to lead
you have to be able to get people into your office
you have to get people go to them
any way you want to do it
but you have to be able to lead
there is no leadership at the top
signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run
i don't want to talk about that
it's inappropriate
tom brady
well, tom brady is a very good friend of mine
he's a great guy
for those of you who don't know him, he's a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete
he is really a very good friend of mine
and i just spoke to him a little while ago
he's so thrilled and so happy
tom brady – i think what they've done is terrible
and he's been exonerated as i understand it because i just heard about it
but i'm very happy for tom
as far as the commissioner is concerned, they're having a rough year
let's face it
they're having a very rough year
well, in europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming
and it's a huge humanitarian problem
and i just say this
this united states has tremendous problems of their own
we have infrastructure that we have to fix
we have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart
our nation's in such trouble
that's why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder i think will greatly help
but we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have – health care, which is a mess
you know, if you look at obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%
people are saying this is turning out to be a disaster
deductibles are through the roof
the deductibles on obamacare it's through the roof
so we have a lot of problems
we have to take care of our vets
we have to build up our military
just the other day, gen
ordierno said that the army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness
now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at hillary clinton – and i've said she's the worst secretary of state in the history of this country
now, in all fairness, because of the agreement that's about to be finalized with iran, john kerry may very well take her place
i think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for israel, for the middle east
it's going to lead to nuclear proliferation – the 24-day clause – everything about it
we don't even get our prisoners back
you say who negotiates a thing like that
that won't happen, i can guarantee you, with a president trump
you'll see it later
yeah
they don't want to hear it
…i would say very simply i just want to be treated like everybody else
you see, i was always the fair hair boy
i was a big contributor
nobody knows the system
but i was on the other side
and i was the elite
i was the fair hair person
once i ran, all of a sudden i was a little bit of an outsider
i became an outsider because i was running
because i wasn't supposed to run
i'm this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman
but i'm not supposed to be running for office
the fact is that our country is being killed on trade by china, by japan, by mexico both at the border and on trade
and i'm not knocking those countries
their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders
they are absolutely killing us
china – taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base
and think of this
we owe china $1
4 trillion and we're paying them interest
we owe japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount – $1
4 trillion
now, that's like a magic act
they send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money
that's not going to happen with me
…well, jeb bush is a very nice man
i'll be honest
i think he's a very nice person
i think he's a very low energy person and i don't think that's what the country needs
i hear he's going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me
and honestly, look, he's getting the money from special interests
he's getting the money from lobbyists and his donors
and they're making him do it because he's crashing in the polls
so i don't know what's going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads – i don't know
i know that my life will continue
i just don't know
i mean nobody's ever spent money on ads against me
but he probably has to do that although it would not be the way i've done
you know, one of the things i'm most honored about is that so far everybody that's attacked me has gone down the tubes
you have lindsey graham attacked me
he was at 3%
now he's at zero
you have perry attacked me
now he's getting out of the race
he was at 4% or 5%
now he's getting out of the race
he was at zero
everybody – rand paul attacked me
i see the last poll – the monmouth poll that just came out today where i'm leading by double figures and rand paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me
now, jeb bush also just went down in the monmouth poll very big
so i don't know
are they going to spend – he's going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money
remember this – they have total control over jeb and hillary and everybody else that takes that money
nobody knows the system better than me
they have total control
you understand it very well because you've been covering it for a long time
those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate
i will tell you this
nobody's putting up millions of dollars for me
i'm putting up my own money
in fact, i feel a little bit foolish
people are offering me millions and millions of dollars
you know, when you're in first place, you can collect so much money and i keep turning them down
i feel like – am i a fool
i feel very foolish
and when i was in iowa last week, i said what do you think
can i take –  one man offered me – a big lobbyist – offered $5 million for my campaign
i said to the crowd in iowa – great crowd, 4,000 people – i said can i take it
and would you believe i'm not going to do anything
i promise you
i swear to you i won't do anything
and they all stood up and said no, no, don't take it
the fact is i'm the only self-funder
i'm putting up my own money
i know there have been some super pacs – 5 or 6 super pacs – where people are forming super pacs for trump
i have nothing to do with them
as you know, you're not allowed to have anything to do with them
so i don't know what they're going to do
hopefully, if they're going to do something it's going to be nice
but i don't know anything about them
but just in a nutshell, i'm funding my own campaign
nobody else's
when people advertise – and i hope the voters can see this
every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests
so just remember that
our country could be doing much better
we have deficits that are enormous
we have all bad trade agreements
we have an army that the heads said is not prepared
we have a military that needs help and especially in these times
we have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 minutes they don't even work
okay
if anybody saw that report
the phones don't work
they're 40 years old
they have wires that are no good
nothing works
our country doesn't work
everybody wins except us
we need victories in this country
we don't have victories any more
our country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems
i think it's great that she's  in the debate
i was in favor of her being – i think she should be in the debate
i don't like the fact that there are 11 people now as i understand it
they're not getting rid of rand paul or somebody
but i think they should because there's too many people
because when you have 11, you're not getting to hear me and you're not getting to hear other people talking and i think that's too bad
i think 11 is a lot of people
but i was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate
i think maybe he's  inclined not to get in the race
i think it's going to depend on what happens with hillary clinton
a lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate
i don't know that to be true
but i think it depends on what happens with her
i think if she gets out, he will get in
i think if she stays in, he might not
who knows
oh, he's not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we're very happy about that
we don't want anything – and i told him
i said, i don't know if it's appropriate reince for you to be here because i don't want anything –  you know, you guys will end up saying he's endorsing trump
so i suggested frankly that i'm fine with him not being here because i don't want anybody to think he's endorsing
as far as jeb is concerned, i watched him this morning on television and it's a little bit sad
don't forget
he was supposed to win
and he just doesn't have the energy
but what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists
and i just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not – if i were him, i'd spend money on positive ads about himself
because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they're at a point where they're not going to leave because they're fed up with what's happening in this country, but i think they're going to go to people other than jeb
i don't know
right now, i'm interested in jobs
one thing – one of the groups, it was actually cnn
i shouldn't say that
but they did a very massive poll and i came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing
and i don't mean by number one
i mean like number one by many, many times
and i am so intent on putting people back to work in this country
you know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now
93 million
when they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats
they take them off the statistics
we have 93 million people
we have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all
our country can be great again
we have to put people back to work
would i bring my children into the administration
i will tell you they are very capable
the answer is probably not
but having them in would be very good
they're very, very capable children
the second part i won't bother asking you
it's no longer pertinent
kanye west
you know what
i'll never say bad about him
you know why
because he loves trump
he loves trump
he goes around saying trump is my all-time hero
he says it to everybody
so, kanye west – i love him
now, maybe in a few years i'll have to run against him
i don't know
so i'll take that back
but he's been so nice to me
you people have sort of seen because i've been a counter-puncher
i only hit people when they hit me
only
and kanye west has been so great
i would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me
no, my supporters are really supporting me because i'm very competent, because they know that i'm not going to let china rip us off
i'm not going to let japan rip us off
japan is devaluing their yen
very hard for caterpillar and other companies to compete against komatsu – their big tractor maker – and others
we're not going to let this happen anymore
they do – you talk about a trade imbalance
they have in japan the biggest ships you've ever seen pouring cars into los angeles, pouring them in
i've never seen anything like it
we send them beef and they don't even want it
it's going to end and they're going to like us
in this building, i have the largest bank in the world
right up these elevators
it's a bank from china
by far the biggest bank in the world
i get along great with china
i get along great with japan
i get along great with mexico
i love the people
i love the people of mexico
i love the hispanics
i have thousands of hispanics right now working for me
over the years, i have employed tens of thousands of hispanics – many from mexico
i have unbelievably great relationships
and in the package that we gave you, you'll see there's a poll and i'm number one with hispanics
you saw that
number one with hispanics
so, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals
we're going to be great to the vets
we're going to be terrific
our military is going to be unbelievable
all of these things – we're going to get rid of obamacare and come up with something that's much better and much less expensive
we're going to get rid of it
we're going to repeal it
it's going to be out
should have been out a long time ago
should have never happened
but we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we're going to bring back wealth to the united states so we can afford to save social security, which i'll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make america great again
ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
and here is your pledge
…i'm going to tell you a story about nashville
you're not even going to believe it
but it's a very personal story
it's a very special place to me for a very special reason
but maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us
she's 92 years old
we don't talk about age but she's 92
and she looks magnificent
and her name is beada and she's become very famous
you know who beada is, right
beada, where are you beada
look at her
so beautiful
so, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life
she hasn't seen anybody that really did it to her
and for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she's going to vote for trump
i think, right
thank you, darling
i really appreciate it
you know, she's become so famous
she's on television all over the world now
i have to be nervous even talking to her, you're so famous
it's great
beada, thank you very much
i really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it
because there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we're going to take this country back and we're going to make this country so great again and so strong again
…well, i just want to tell you about nashville
so, years ago – many years ago – like i hate to say 40 but i won't say 40 but close to 40, i came to nashville
did you ever hear of a company called genesco
genesco
right
so, they were based in nashville, tennessee, and they owned the bonwit teller department store chain
and i was a young guy and i came from brooklyn in queens, and i wanted to go into manhattan
and i went into manhattan and i did the grand hyatt hotel and i did some other things that were good
but the thing i wanted more than anything was fifth avenue between 57th and 56th street, which is called the tiffany location right next to tiffany
and that's what i wanted
i wanted that piece of property so badly
i shouldn't say that because you're not supposed to want things like that so badly
god will get angry at me, right
but i wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was genesco based in nashville, tennessee
and i came in and i came to nashville, and i met with the heads of genesco who were really great people actually
and they were having a lot of difficulties
there were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything
and i convinced them to sell me the land and the building
and i bought the bonwit teller store fifth avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding tiffany
i bought all the air rights and then ultimately i bought the air rights from tiffany and i built trump tower
and to this day it's one of the great buildings of the world and it's one of the great successes
and i love country music and i went to the grand ole opry while i was here
and i just had such an incredible experience
and when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places – you know, when you're leading in every poll, they sort of want you
when you're not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don't want you at all
and we'll talk about the polls in a second
but i had a lot of choices for this morning, and i guess i could have also gone and played golf like the president does all the time, right
but i decided let's do this
and i really chose nashville because the experience is one of my – it's not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it's so important and it's been such a great – from the day i built it it was a home run
and it all really took place because of nashville, tennessee
so, i really – it's an honor to be with you folks, i can tell you
real honor
so, coming over i heard and i watched television – you know, they have all these cameras back there and they're live
and i guess we're live on cnn, we're live on so many different things
it's always difficult
you know, when you're always live, you've got to change up your speech
you can't make the speech over and over…
the other candidates don't get covered live ever, except for the debate
so you know, they had 24 million people on the debate
now they think when the new numbers come out they'll be even substantially higher than that
so i would've said they would have had a million or two
so i say they have 24 million people
and i say, well now the second debate, which is on cnn – that was on fox, maybe i should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity
does that make sense
all to charity
all to charity
when i said that to the writers at time magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story
and i said, you know, and i sort of thought i said it off the record but they put it in time magazine
so now – maybe should i ask for charity, maybe a nice nashville charity and american cancer society and aids research – so many of this – there's so many good – alzheimer's – you know, there's so many things going on
maybe i should ask for a lot of money or i'm not showing up
you know, it's interesting
so they'll get 2 million – a million to 2 million people at the debates
you know, they've been doing them for a long time
they don't do great, especially the early republican debate
like you know the expression – it draws flies
that's what it draws
so this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television
i think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television
naturally i took full credit for it, which in all fairness i should
i should
so bottom line i think i might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know
but i did say is it a little hokey if i do that
maybe it's not so nice
so what do you think
should i do it or not
maybe not
i don't know
here's the thing
if i don't do it, cnn just makes a lot of money
i don't care about cnn
honestly
no, they're going to make a lot of money
they just shut off their camera
they're actually very nice
but they're going to make a lot of money and, you know, it's something we should consider
so we'll all consider it together
but coming over today, i saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the dreamers having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children
and these are people who come over to the country and they're dreamers
and i said, what about our children
why can't our children that are in the country, why can't they be the dreamers
nobody ever talks about that
no, no, nobody ever talks about that
you know, we talk about the dreamers, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets
you know, our vets are incredible
no, no, the illegal immigrants in many cases…are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have – our wounded warriors are – these are the greatest people we have
and another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, good morning ladies and gentlemen
nashville, it's wonderful –  you know, is that i can sort of be very current
okay
i can be very, very current
i can talk about what's happening
this morning on the television, they had a whole story about the veterans administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in
these are our veterans
these are the people that got hurt fighting for us
maybe we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them, to be honest with you
i mean, that's possible too
they had a story this morning on fox, on cnn and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there's supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there's nobody there
and the veterans – i don't know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying where are the people
and then, they said, what happened
and they said, this happens all the time
there was not even – nobody even there
and two weeks ago on wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history – in the history of the veterans administration for people wanting to see a doctor
when i go to a doctor, if i have to wait like 9 minutes, i'm like get me –  i'd go crazy
it's true
remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house
right
beada remembers that
you'd have a cold
the doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top
and he'd come over to your house, check you out, fine
those days don't exist anymore
you know, we're in age of obamacare where nothing exists
by the way, we will repeal and replace obamacare
that i can tell you
that i can tell you
but, so two weeks ago wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the veterans administration
so that if you go to the doctor's office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days
one case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation
now, you think about that
can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day
but these people are waiting four, five days
so the wait's now the longest in history and that's the way we're treating our greatest people and that's not right and we're going to change that
we're going to change that
we have right now – and people don't know this
you know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically
all talk, no action politicians
and i mean on both sides in all fairness
you know, i'm a republican
i'm a conservative
but i'm just as angry with the republicans because they go to washington, something happens – they become weak
you know, they go to washington – we're going to stop obamacare
we're going to stop this
we're going to do this
we're going to do that
then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go oh, i made it, darling, i made it
i vote for you
i vote for you
i vote for obamacare expansions
i'll do whatever you want me to do
i'm in washington
it's amazing
isn't it amazing
don't you agree
i won't happen to me, i promise
and if it does, you can let me know about it
but it won't
i promise
i promise
but you know, they show those phony statistics where we're 5
4% unemployment
the real number
you know, i actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not
but when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force
93 million people
of the 93 many of these people want jobs
and they quit looking
so if you're looking for a job and you can't find it and you stop for a while – you know, after a while you sort of like it's not happening
it's not going to happen
i don't know what they do
but they stop
they are considered statistically employed
okay
so, we have 93 million people out of the labor force
i mean, think about it
it's hard to believe
we have 50 million people in poverty
these are very new numbers
50 million people in poverty
taking our money
japan's taking our money
mexico is beating us at the border and on trade
by the way, they're killing us on trade
you know that
in fact, you just lost a big car plant to mexico in tennessee
remember
recently front page wall street journal
a plant that you were going to have…
you know this is a movement, folks
this is not like maybe even about me
i don't want it to be about me
this is about common sense
it's about doing the right thing
one of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing
some of the polls, i mean, hey, in iowa, we're leading big
those are great people
we just left iowa
we had such an amazing evening
4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening
we just left alabama, which was unbelievable
31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour
and it did
it poured the minute my speech – that's like luck
that's from god
the minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured
we had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable
and the poll just came out in alabama, leading big in alabama
leading big in iowa
leading tremendously big in new hampshire
great people
leading really big in new hampshire
leading big in florida
how about florida
i have a governor
we have a low energy governor and we have a senator and we're leading big in florida
how do you do that when you have a senator who's sitting, you have a governor who's been there for eight years and trump –
i love florida and i'm there a lot
what could be in florida
great weather
you have great weather but florida has great weather
big advantage
but you know, i'm leading big in florida
but one of the polls came out because in south carolina and north carolina, i'm leading really big
and in south carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability – you know, i'm the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say – i think i had one poll where i'm 41% – almost 41% – can you imagine
41%
there's 17 people
so i'm at 41% with 17 people and they said trump's at 41% but look – you can't even hear it
you know, trump says bleh
nobody knows what they just said
but there are some people that don't like him
it's unbelievable
i'm the only one that wins these polls and i get negative publicity
no, it's incredible
the press, ayeyayay
…well, yesterday, you might have seen me
i was in south carolina
i made a speech
i had to bring it up
the new york times to me is a big deal
you know, i'm from new york
very liberal paper but that's okay
you know, not everybody could be like us
but it's still the new york times
right
we have to admit, still the new york times
and i'm on the front page a lot on the new york times, and to be on the front page of the new york times is a big deal
but yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level hispanic commentator
low level guy
this one didn't like me
by the way, i think i'm going to win the hispanic vote and i think – you know, in nevada, i won the hispanic poll
they love me
i love the hispanic people
incredible energy
incredible people
i love the people
i have so many – i have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me
they're great people
and i said, i'm going to win
and a lot of the hispanics that are here legally, they don't want people coming in illegally
you know it's true
it's true
so there's this poll that comes out
i think it was in south carolina where we're way up and lindsey at 4% and he's the senator
i'm at 30%
so i wrote him a note, congratulations
i'm only beating you in your home state by 26 points
so anyways, who cares
but they did something that nobody reported
they say, oh but do people like trump
by the way, this election is not going to be like
i think i'm a nice person
i love people
i want to help people
women's health issues to me are very important
to jeb bush it wasn't important because he didn't want to fund them
and then he said, oh, i misspoke
but you know, i really want to be a nice person and i am a nice person
but i think it's actually going to be an election based on competence
we're tired of being like the patsy for everybody
i really do
i think it's time
but in the poll, this was the monmouth poll
big poll
highly re – in another act of political magic…trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative – nobody wrote this by the way
nobody said it
nobody reported it
from negative to positive
this is an exact quote
i have like this photographic memory so i don't need – but i want to be sure because if i used the word the incorrectly, they'll say, he didn't –
favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month
a feat that monmouth university's patrick murray's highly respected pollster called astounding
called it astounding
nobody else wrote about it
that defies any rule in presidential politics that i've ever seen, said this highly respected man
murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he's never seen that before
and you know what
that's because people have heard me and they say you're such a nice person
no, they want – they say he's a man – i've made a tremendous amount of money
i've had tremendous success
and i don't say that braggingly
that's the kind of thinking we need in the country
i mean, whatever it is
but to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll
we were much, much higher, more than double everybody
and we are more than double everybody
you saw the quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll
i was the same thing
much, much higher – double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates
and the reason is people in this country are smart
they don't believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people – you know, why are they doing this
i mean, why are they even saying it
you'd think that if somebody's good for the country – and i'll be great for the country because i'm going to make great deals for our country
we don't win anymore
our country doesn't win anymore
you'd think somebody – even a liberal person or a democrat liberal and i mean, really liberal
somebody who's going to make the country – why are they knocking it
why are they knocking
why do they fight
you'd think they'd say let's do it
it's good
it's good for all of us
because our country is in trouble
we owe now $19 trillion
you know, i've been saying $18  for a while now
but now it starts to go up quickly
and by the way, when obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in in '16, you want to see bad deficits
you want to see it go up
you're going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs
and it's no good
have you noticed – and you've seen it yourself – the premiums have gone through the roof
right
the deductibility – unless you're close to death, you're never going to use it
you can't use it because the deductibility is so high
but the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more
it's a disaster
and on top of that, it's going to cost the country a fortune
so it's not only costing you a lot of money, it's going to cost the country a fortune
so we have to do something about it
and we have to do something importantly about it
but when i see the people on television and i have to tell you i won't mention names, some of them when they hear my name – i was talking – we have a great reporter today from the wall street journal with us
okay
who came down
and she actually said some of them when they hear your name it looks like they're a boiler waiting to explode
it's true
…now, number one, they look bad because they said – do you remember the beginning
like three, four months ago
they said, he's a clown
he's a clown
just having fun
you know, i went to a great school
i did great
i did – everything was great
i came out
i made a fortune, which i want to use the brain for you, but i made a fortune
i then did a book called the art of the deal and many bestsellers
the art of the deal being probably the best selling business book of all time
who has read the art of the deal
yeah, most people
most everybody
i jokingly say but i mean it – the bible tops it by a long way
i say that
i say that
said it the first time in iowa
people liked that
but it's true
nothing tops the bible
but the art of the deal – great success
many books – bestsellers
many, many bestsellers
then i do the apprentice
i've never done television
i do the apprentice
it's one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way
and nbc renewed the apprentice
you know that
right
for me
they came up to my office, the head of comcast – great guy – i won't use names
just say steve
no, honestly he's a great guy
one of the best in the country
he came up with the heads of nbc six months ago and they said, donald, we're renewing the apprentice
please, you'll have to do – you have to do it
i said, honestly, steve, i'm running for president
i want to make our country great again
i want to make -
and they didn't believe me
and i said it four times
they didn't believe me
nobody believed that i was going to run
nobody
my wife didn't even believe me, but now she does
but she actually said if you actually say you're going to run, you're going to do great because people like you
she actually said they'd love you but i don't want to brag
but she said, if you actually run – not you may run, you may not run, who knows
but she said if you actually say -
so the nbc guys come up – terrific people
i mean, honestly i had a great relationship with nbc for 12 years
we had many, many, you know number ones and the apprentice continues to do great
you know, last season you know how well it did
so they wanted to renew it for many, many shows
in fact, mark burnett called up
you know mark burnett
he did survivor, apprentice
so mark burnett, who's a great guy, he calls up and he goes i don't believe it
you're not taking a renewal
the word is renewal
i said, that's right, mark
i'm going to run for president
no, no, no, you have to – nobody doesn't take a renewal
it's unheard of in primetime television
two hours primetime
are you crazy
i said, mark, i have to do this
i've done so well in this country
i have to do it
we can save our country
we can save our country
so anyways, the bottom line, nbc renewed it
i told them i'm not doing it, and then they finally believed me when i actually announced
they don't like me anymore
it's amazing
they do not like me
but it's too bad
too bad
well, thank you
you know, the funny thing about the apprentice – there have been 15 copies of the apprentice
every single one of them failed
so then a reporter said to me, why do you think that is
i said because i'm special
and i was kidding
i was doing it sarcastically – i mean, i sort of meant it to be honest, right
but i was sort of kidding
and they wrote it and i hated the way it looked in writing
you know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing
but so i had a great experience
so here i am – great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do the apprentice, tremendous success
when i did the apprentice, a certain critic said it will never be successful because you know to have a big hit – a really a number one hit – you have to – and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever
the finale of the apprentice
aye
remember with the great bill rancic
remember how that was
incredible
but to have a great success, you have to have women
and i'll never forget – i saved the article
right
like harry truman saved it where it said, truman loses and he actually won
remember
but i saved this article
they said trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch donald trump
and i said, am i so bad
am i so bad
tell me, am i so bad
and it turned out that women were the biggest base
i mean, those were the ones that liked…so you know i saved those things
but no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible
and honestly, it's going to be hard
it's going to be a lot of work
it's going to be a lot of time
i wouldn't leave the white house
you know, obama always leaves the white house
think of it
you're elected president
you're in the white house
why would you want to leave
i think i'd maybe never leave
how cool is that
he leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers
i'll try – i don't know maybe there's some rules against it
so maybe i can't
but i'll do the fundraisers in the white house
he and his wife left – i think one was doing the ellen show another was doing another show right next door in burbank, california
they left a couple of hours difference
one took air force one
one took a beautiful boeing 757
two planes
a little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows
and i say why
why aren't they flying at least the same plane
now, i know what those suckers cost because i happen to have one of them right
so i know what it costs to operate these planes…more importantly, the time and the energy
but i would have said ellen or i would have said whoever was doing the show, let's do it from the white house
this way, i take a half and hour, i go back, i don't spend any money of the taxpayers
…and you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better
we're doing our show live from the white house or something
so we don't pay any money
we don't have to fuel up air force one, which costs you – do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things
with hundreds and hundreds of security and you're closing down burbank, california
i mean, every time obama comes to manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, i say what's going on
you can't move
they closed down all the streets
they closed down the city
and he could do it from like washington
in fact, he could do it in my new hotel that i'm buying which is only a couple of blocks
…it's true
i'm building this incredible hotel on pennsylvania avenue and it's going to be incredible
the old post office
and i actually got it from the obama administration, which is hard to believe
people say what's going on
how did trump get it
one of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the general services administration, which owned it
you know, they're the ones that made the decision
and i got it and we're building this phenomenal hotel – trump international hotel – right on pennsylvania avenue directly between congress and the white house
right
it's going to open just in time – and by the way, listen to this one
we're under budget and ahead of schedule
do you ever hear that from government
way under budget
so we're actually going to be opening and it'll be great
but he can use my hotel
i'll let him use it free
you just come in, use it, go back to the white house
but you don't have to do that
but you'd say to yourself why – you know, it's a mindset
but more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country
you don't want to waste time
you've got to do this
you've got to make deals
i've got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us
carl icahn – incredible guy
right
incredible guy
great deal maker
i've got some of the greatest deal makers in the world
they're all calling me too
they said you didn't ask me
i have these guys calling me up – the best in the world
now, i know the best
i also know guys that are overrated
i know guys that you haven't heard of that honestly are phenomenal
i know a lot that you have heard of that aren't really that good, that are overrated in my opinion
but they're the best in the world
and they're calling me
they don't want money
they're worth billions of dollars
but when i put, let's say, carl icahn and i'll say carl, do me a favor
handle china
we're going to make a great deal
no, no, we're going to make a great deal because that's what happens
you know, that's what happens
so, we're going to take back our trade
if you look at china, if you look at japan – i was in los angeles a few weeks ago
i saw ships – the biggest ships i've ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in japan, very nice
everything's nice
except that it doesn't help us
when does it help us
when does it help us
we sell them beef
beef
and then they don't want it
because you know, do you ever see what's going on over there
we sell the beef and it goes over there and it's very perishable
so by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over we don't want it
they have cars coming from these massive, massive ships
massive
and they just pour off the ships
and i say, what are we doing
how stupid are we
no tax, no nothing
and i'm a free trader
i believe in free trade
i have to say
but i have to be fair trade
when you look at japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here
we get nothing by comparison
it's like peanuts
balance it out, fellows
balance it out
got to balance it
a friend of mine is a great manufacturer
as you know, china has – it's probably the greatest theft in the history of the united states what china has done to us
they've taken our money
they've taken our jobs
they've taken everything
they've taken so much
and they're creating a bubble and you know interestingly we're so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might
and we've got to be smart
i made so much money dealing with china
i made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with china
the bank of america building in san francisco – i own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows
nobody knows
you know, all these guys come to forbes
oh, trump's worth only $5 billion or $4 billion
or whatever
he's only worth $5 billion
it's like a bankrupt magazine…they don't even know my numbers
they said, well, we haven't been able to look at about 400 of his companies
so i filed
interestingly, they said he'll never run
he'll never run
…then i announced
then they said, oh, he'll never file his form whatever
that's a single page where basically you're signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement
i signed my form
and they said, well, he'll never ever put in his financials
and you have like 90 days or something
and they said, he'll ask for extensions but he'll never show because he's probably not as rich as people think
but actually i'm much richer and i put in my financials – it's true
it's true
and forbes and another group said, no, no, we don't know what these companies are
i put in these massive financials, and you know, i was so proud
i might have filed if i wasn't going to run
i wanted to show people
i wanted to brag
it's such a great company i've built
so they said, he'll never put in his financials
i put in the financials
and everybody – they're much bigger
it's a much bigger – you know, very little debt, tremendous value
and really great assets
iconic assets
you know, iconic
doral, turnberry in scotland
i mean, i have some of the greatest real estates in the world
and i'm very proud of it
but they say, he'll never file
he'll never file
then they see all these companies
and you know, they have boxes
and because it wasn't really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes
they say, is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million
the last box is $50 million or more
$50 million or more
so like i have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that
i have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that
so it says $50 million or more
so i checked many of them
i don't know how many
i think there's 23 of them
can you believe it
so i checked like, i don't know, i think it's 23
i could be wrong
oh, they'll kill me if i'm wrong
but i'm not sure
but i think it's like 23 boxes
$50 million or more
so you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you
they added up 23 50s
now, some of the 50s are worth a billion
some of them are worth more than a billion
so it says $50 million or more, i go 50
so they'll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more
and they add them up and they say well, he's worth $2
9 billion
it's really – this is the press
and they have no clue
those statements aren't really meant for me – it's not meant for a guy like me
but with all of that the statements were so good
they're so good
they're so good
and you know, one of the things i'm doing and last night was incredible
we had an amazing event in massachusetts
right
oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in nashville
what are you doing
…anyway, so here i am
i spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel
okay
like a lot of money on jets
but somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing
i didn't know who did it
but somebody puts up a sign
so all over the place, i'm spending millions of dollars
i'm turning down millions
i don't want your money
i don't want your money
somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn't have to make
but they put it up
it's all over cnn
trump is asking for $100
i fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune
the fuel
the $100
the money that i raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something
the guy that had it is a great guy – ernie
a great guy
really successful guy
you know him, right
ernie
he'll sell you a car any day of the week, right
and you know the guy is – like 2,000 people showed up
let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they're serving
so they put up a sign
i don't want the money
i might like $4 or $5 million
that's hard to turn down
but the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people i think came in free
and i end up with this big story – trump accepting contributions
i can't believe it
i got so angry at my people
because somebody put up a sign saying $100
and honestly, first of all, it's like peanuts
it doesn't mean anything
but they used to it to try and marginalize
they always do
they always do
the bottom line is i am self-funding my campaign
i'm self-funding
i don't want to have anybody giving
i don't need money
now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it's not a lot of money but it's great money
like beada might send me some money
beada will send me some money
but a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from georgia
another person sent me $12
small money
and some sent me $1,000
but it doesn't amount to a lot
but that i do like coming in because they invest in the campaign
how do i take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from georgia
dear so and so, i'm sorry i don't really want your money
how do you write a letter like that
i want them to invest in it
you know, but they're not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for china because they are lobbyists for china and they gave me $5 million
i had a big lobbyist asked me to have – he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign
i turned him down
i turned him down
and then i see this story on cnn last night
it was disgusting
that look there's a sign – $100
somebody does a sign
it actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth
it was so beautiful
it was beautifully done
and they're doing this big thing about all day long last night about – i said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize
and that's the press
that's the media
yeah, the criminal media
i mean, there's truth to it
no, because a lot of times they know it's wrong
but i just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event
it had to be a record for a house
the guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent
but we had 2,000 people
it had to be a record
the spirit in that group, the spirit in alabama, the spirit was so incredible
the spirit in our last meeting in iowa
don't forget
when i went to iowa and you know what i love
i'm leading with tea party
big
i love tea party
i love the tea party
tea party people, stand up and take a bow
you have not been treated fairly
no, you haven't been treated fairly
you have not been treated fairly
you know, people talk about the tea party and you talk about marginalizing, at least i have a microphone where i can fight back
you people don't
the tea party people are incredible people
these are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media
it's disgusting
and you will be surprised how big you are
you don't know how big you are
you don't know the power that you have
i mean it
you don't know the power that you have
the tea party and you can call it anything that you want
i don't care about names
but the tea party has tremendous power
i talked silent majority
but the silent majority is more than tea party
it's democrats
it's poor people
it's rich people
it's everybody
it's evangelicals
one of the things that made me so happy – i'm a protestant
i'm a presbyterian
right
– is that i had a recent poll and they did a beautiful – like these polls are great
you know, guys like jeb bush and hillary, they hire pollsters
they pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars
what do you have to do that for
every week they come out with a new poll
right
hey, i'm rich
i could hire a hundred poll
i don't want to waste money
you know, why should i pay
i know in one case…like $150,000 a month
and you know, then they're arrogant guys
they think they're hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say
you've got to say this
you've got to be politically correct
no way
i don't have time to be political
no, it's true
it's true
i don't have time to be political
you know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct
you saw the anchor baby thing
did you see that with where i'm on
and somebody from…it's the same network – cnn again – he said, you know the name anchor baby is very insulting
i said, what would you call it
and he gave me like nine words
a baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that
i said, how can i say that
it's too long
it's anchor baby
and then bush – jeb
jeb bush gets caught because he is such a nice person
honestly
if you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for jeb
the country is going to go to hell but we won't talk of that
no, no, but if you want a nice person
so jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo
you know, don't say this, don't say that
all these things
pages of stuff
but one of the things – never use the term ‘anchor baby'
so all of a sudden, he's using the term anchor baby just last week
and with me, when i use it nobody criticizes me
they expect me
they gave up
okay
with him, they killed him
they just killed him
it didn't stop
and then he blamed it on the asians
he said, you know – did you see that
and then the new york times did an editorial how dare you attack the asians
so he wanted to steer away from the hispanics
he said, well, you know, the asians come in and they also have anchor babies
and now the asians all hate him
it's true
but the asians love me and i love them
i love them
so he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says – a couple of years ago – don't use this term, and now he's using it because he has to
because baby – you know, think of it
think of it
i want to build a wall
okay
so easy
so easy
when this clown – jose reyes or whatever the hell his name – no, he's a baseball player
ramos
actually jose reyes is a baseball player
he's a nice baseball player
but when ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and i had all these reporters
actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming
so i even had liberal people from cbs – i actually said to the cbs guy yes
and this guy stands up and starts screaming
so when he – and i actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him
i didn't do anything like – i didn't do anything
except for the times
and that's what i alluded to before
the times said, donald trump railed at him and screamed at him
i didn't scream at him
but he was screaming at me
and much worse than that, they said i wore a toupee
can you believe it
i don't wear a toupee, and i proved it – i won't bring anybody up
i won't bring anybody up
but i don't
but think of it
i'm in the front page of the new york times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer – this hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of – saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee
and i don't
so, i'm on the front page of the new york times
i can't even talk about it
i'm embarrassed to talk about it
but they also said, i was essentially screaming at this guy from univision, who i happen to be suing for $500 million
they didn't mention that
they also didn't mention that his daughter works for hillary clinton
did you know that
his daughter works for hillary clinton
oh, you didn't know that
no, they didn't mention that
no, no
they said i was wearing a toupee and i was screaming but they didn't
no, he's screaming at me
so we very nicely – and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk
he actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit
you know, he's a very emotional man
but, he said, you can't build a wall because you can't do it
so, 2,000 years ago in china – we always get back to china – 2,000 years ago, the great wall of china – oh, we'd like to have a wall
this is a serious wall
okay
this is a wall you don't go through so easy
they built a wall 2,000 years ago that's 13,000 miles
think of that
that's a big wall
that's serious wall, right
this was 2,000 years ago
i mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, i got to be a little bit – you know, took a long time
but 13,000 miles that's a long time
they had no tractors
they didn't have caterpillars
of course, today, we use komatsus because they're made in japan and you could buy them cheaper
how stupid is that
because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying komatsus instead of caterpillars
caterpillar's stock is down
it's terrible
we'll change that around
believe me
believe me
but, they build this wall
now, we have really 15 – i would say – look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000
but you don't need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places
and actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built
hillary wanted it built
but they couldn't
because i'm a great builder
what i do best is build
i'm not a rendering guy
i do the building and then do the rendering
a lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built
does that make sense to anybody
i'm the opposite
i get it built
so, one of the reasons it couldn't get built is because they couldn't get an approved environmental impact study
do you believe this
no, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things
they couldn't get it
they could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall
and they're killing people
we have illegal immigrants
you see that with kate in san francisco
you see it with jamiel
you see it with so many people
last night in massachusetts i met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants
they come into this country and kill members of their family
last week in california, a 66-year-old veteran – a female, a veteran, 66 – got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed
raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed
66-years-old
by an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily
but this is what we have
we have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border
and you know what
we have great border patrol people
i went there
you probably saw that
that's why the hat is so successful
the white one, right
but i went there, everybody wants to buy the hat
now they like the white one
then two weeks later, i wore the red one
the white one didn't sell so well
the red one sells
crazy thing
but i went to the border and i got to know the people and i saw people, and you know it's rough stuff, it's rough stuff
and when i first came in and when i first did my opening statement that i was running for president, i talked about illegal immigration
i was killed by the press
rush limbaugh, who i think is a terrific guy, said trump has received more incoming than any human being i've ever seen
then he goes and has a news conference and i think he's going to apologize and he doubles down
i got credit
i got credit
no, they thought i was going to apologize
and i don't mind apologizing but i have to make a mistake to apologize and i was right
no, i was right
so for two weeks, as rush said, i took incoming…in fact that was my first two weeks
i said is it going to be like this for the next year and a half
i don't know if i can make it
it was brutal
now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they've apologized to me
everybody says i'm right
and only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration
they wouldn't even be talking about it
they wouldn't even be talking about it
and we're going to build a wall and we're going to get, you know, the gang members in baltimore and in chicago and these are some tough dudes
they're going to be out so fast
one of the first thing i'm going to do is get rid of those gang members
we're going to be – you know, you look at what's going on with baltimore, you look at what's going on in chicago and ferguson and st
louis the other night
we are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin
you know, we can be very tough
i just met your cops outside
those police are tough cookies
those guys – we need law and order
we need law and order
i mean, they allowed – in one night, that first night in baltimore – they allowed that city to be destroyed
and they set it back 35 years
one night
because the police were not allowed to protect people
they weren't allowed to protect people
we have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be – the head of the police in chicago is a person i know
originally from new york
he's a phenomenal guy
he can stop things if they're allowed to stop them
he can stop it
believe me
we have some incredible people
but we have to be tough
we have to be smart
you know, i know you're going to have some bad apples
you're going to have problems
i see some of the things
you did too and it's disgusting and it's horrible
but that's such a tiny percentage
the problem is the good work doesn't get shown on television
all of the good work, which is 99
i mean, the good work with the police
it's 99
that one little thing
and it's horrible
i agree
i hated some of the things
i don't have to go into them
but you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like i was
but we need law and order
we need our police
they're great people
they do a phenomenal job
they're right now afraid of doing anything
they're afraid
i mean, i know cities
i won't mention names but i know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension
they don't want to be thrown off the police force
and then you wonder why there's crimes in our cities
so we need a whole new mindset
we have to build up our military
we have to make our military so strong
we have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it
we never have to use it
we also have to focus on what we have – look, ukraine
i want ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good
but ukraine is near germany and all of these european countries
we're now sending f-22s
that's the newest fighters
the best in the world
we're sending fighters every – where's germany
where are all these european countries
it affects them
it affects them
and we want to stand alongside of them
i agree
but why are we leading the fight
putin hates us
he hates obama
he doesn't hate us
i think he'd like me
i'd get along great with him i think if you want to know the truth
no, he has no respect for our president and our president doesn't like him in all fairness
they don't have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say
but i'd get along with these people
think of it
every country is ripping us off
even russia is ripping us off because in the iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, russia is a big beneficiary because they're going to sell iran missiles with the money we give to iran
think of that
so one of the biggest beneficiaries is russia
okay
but think of it
so, ukraine – let's take a few of these things and then i'm getting the hell out of here
i'm going back to new york
do you mind
maybe i'll go to the grand ole opry tonight
can i do that
i'd actually rather – i love – by the way, this is not a politician speaking
believe me
i hope
i love country music
i love it
hey, trace adkins – right
and who else won on the apprentice
who else
john rich
my kids love those two guys
john rich
and who else
who did really well
clint black
right
clint black
he did great
and my trace – how good is trace, okay
you know, trace came onto the apprentice
and i said, who the hell is he
who is he
i didn't know who trace was
i'd never heard of him
and he wasn't a big name
and he came on – just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it now…it went to number one
and then he came to me the next year…but trace came to me and he goes – you know, at certain awards show, i won't mention the name – but he said last year, i couldn't get into the show and this year i'm hosting it, mr
trump, all because of you
nice, right
i know, nice
but those three guys, they're great and they're just fantastic people
but we've got to make our country so strong
we have to make our country rich again
a person came up and said, oh, that's not nice
what's not nice
they said rich, you know, to say we're going to make our country rich
we can't make our country great if we're going to be poor
we're a debtor nation
we owe $19 trillion
china – think of this – china we owe $1
4 trillion to
so they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1
4 trillion
how do you do that
that's like a magic act
right
it's true
japan sells us cars by the millions
they make a fortune
they come in, they sell us cars by the millions
and we owe them the exact same amount
we owe them $1
4 trillion
how come if they're selling us cars we owe them money
think of it
put on your business
see
i have a natural instinct for this stuff
right
you know
right
if we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money
but we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds
and we're paying interests on them and we owe them money
so, it'll change
it can change
it's not even going to be hard
people don't realize
see, obama never read the art of the deal
people don't realize
oh, and somebody said sharon
it was sharon
where's sharon
she gave me such a hard time
where's sharon
where the hell is she
you could have both sharons stand up actually
where are they
both of them
sharon is great
oh, did they go after her…she took a lot of incoming
sharon, did you take a lot of incoming
i think so
right
thank you, darling
so, we are going to do something that if i get elected – and again they said i'll never run and now…one guy said – john mclaughlin – you ever watch the mclaughlin report
i like him
and one of the people on the little group said donald trump is a great businessman but he'll never make it as a president
he'll never get elected
he'll never make it
and john mclaughlin – this crusty guy who i like
i don't know him
i never met him, i don't think
but i like
he's sitting there and he goes – and he got angry – he goes why wouldn't he make it
you tell me why
he's been a tremendous success in everything he's done
i go all over the world
i see him name
i see his name all over
he's a great success
and he said – i think this is the word – he's a man of great achievement
why wouldn't he make it
and i thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up
you know, because you need somebody of great achievement
you need – i've produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year
i don't have to worry about obamacare
i take such good care of my employees
i have thousands of employees
i take good care of them
we have great plans
my employees are lucky
they hit the lotto, okay
but i take great care – education and health care – and my people are very happy
but i've done this for a long time, and i've seen ups and downs
i've seen market crashes
i've seen friends of mine go bankrupt
you've never seen – i've never gone bankrupt
by the way, i've used the laws to my advantage and companies
i buy a company
i throw it into a chapter
i negotiate with banks
i kill
you know
and then they say trump goes bankrupt
these people – they don't have any –
now, when other people do that, when a carl does it – i mean, they do it all the time
they use it all the time
it's called using your head
it's called using the laws
actually i did a good job didn't i at the debate when chris matthews so angrily said – i do what every other great businessman does
i buy a company – you know, it's one company was sort of interesting
a friend of mine had it
good guy
and the banks were just killing him
they were mean
and banks can be mean, right
you've got to teach them how to behave, right
so this guy was just getting beaten
and i did him a favor and i called up the banks
and i said do me this, do this, do this, do that
they said, we won't do that
no, we won't do that
i said, you're making a mistake
anyways, it's sort of a little bit complicated…i bought it
immediately, i called them back and said, don't do this
i threw it into a chapter
and they come out with the story trump files bankruptcy
can you believe it
i negotiated it to hell
what i did to that bank – ayeyeye
they see me walking down the street and they go hey, hey, hey
but then i'm good at that stuff, you know
i'm really good at that stuff
but you have to use the laws to your advantage
no, no, you have to use it to your advantage
atlantic city
you know, you look at atlantic city
caesar's went bankrupt
whoever heard of caesar's
caesar's filed chapter 11
nobody cares
everybody in atlantic city
i had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because i have a vision for things
i said, don't go into iraq even though i'm a very militaristic person
i said don't go into iraq and they shouldn't have because i said you're going to destabilize the middle east
so what did we get – $2 trillion
thousands of deaths
thousands
like 5,000
wounded warriors who i love all over the place
we can't even go there
iran is taking over iraq
with the money that we're giving them, they're going to take off and they're going to get the oil, they're going to get everything
the oil they don't get isis is getting
what do we get
nothing
we get nothing
we got far less than nothing
so i had vision in 2004 – reuters – actually it was before that but they wrote a story
trump says don't do iraq
now, i'm much more militaristic than bush, even the brother
but you got to know where to use it and when
you got to use
so with atlantic city, seven years ago, i got out
that's called vision
i should get credit for vision
and again, this isn't bragging
normally, i wouldn't say this but i need your fricking votes
do you understand that
do you understand that
i mean, normally i wouldn't
so i got great credit
i got out
but most of the places in atlantic city are either in trouble or they're bankrupt
they went bankrupt
but i made a lot of money in atlantic city
i had a great time in atlantic city but they asked me a nasty question, i gave a great answer
i thought
so i think i solved it
listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if i win
we are going to have victories again
we are going to win
in fact, last night in front of the audience and i've never said this before
last night in front of the audience i said we're going to have so many victories
and then i said we're going to win here
we're going to win on trade
we're going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody's going to play with us
nobody's going to mess with us
okay
nobody
and we're going to have victories
so many victories that are going to be coming out…in fact, you might get tired of victories
you may not want anymore…and everyone stood up and said no, no, no, we want to keep winning
if i win, we will have victories all over
we will win on trade
we will win on health care
we will win on everything
i will protect your social security without cuts
i will protect your medicare and your medicaid
we are going to have something that's so special
and you know, my whole fame is and i'll say it once
we will make america truly great again
and thank you very much
thank you everybody
thank you
thank you very much
thank you, everybody
great honor
great honor, thank you
this is a wonderful day
on a saturday morning yet
isn't that nice
thank you, all
and we're going to have an incredible convention
it's really going well
we're going to have an incredible convention
and we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly
so i'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the white house, to fix our rigged system  we are in a rigged, rigged system  and to make america safe again and to make america great again
i want to also address the islamic terror attack in france
we've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look
and now it's happening more and more
and it's never going to stop
we need new leadership
we need new thinking
we need strength
we need in our country law and order
and if i'm elected president, that will happen
i want to express our unyielding support for the people of france, and we mourn their loss as a nation
and as far as turkey is concerned, so many friends in turkey, great people, amazing people
we wish them well
it looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well
a lot  a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out
now, as, hopefully, the next president of the united states, i want to refer back to what's happened over the years
the middle east today is more unstable than ever before
never been like this
out of control
after four years of clinton, who really led the way and led obama down a horrible path, because i don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path
he didn't know what he was doing
iraq, syria, all into chaos
and iran is on a path to nuclear weapons
and on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end
now we're seeing unrest in turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of obama-clinton
you just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems
we also need to bring back in this country  because we see what happened  our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs
they've been taken away, like we're babies
taken away
and we're going to bring them back
i found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous  really prosperous society for all americans
indiana governor mike pence was my first choice
i've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of indiana
and i'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute
but i also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you
he is a solid, solid person
governor pence served indiana with distinction in congress
he rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire house republican conference
number one
he's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the obama administration
it's horrible out there
high taxes and regulations
and it's out of control
mike pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty
we know that
hillary clinton is the embodiment of corruption
she's a corrupt person
what she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and i see the ads up all the time, the ads
she's totally bought and paid for by wall street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent
she's crooked hillary
and i think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, i think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails  but it wasn't a loss, she discarded  that in itself is a major crime
other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with hillary clinton
thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's ok
didn't give them to the fbi
didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's ok
wipes her server clean, that's ok
these are crimes
these are crimes
and how she got away with it, i think i understand it, but i think a lot of people don't
but i do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when november 8th rolls around
she's going to pay it at the polls
i believe that
on top of everything else, hillary made $21
6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time
she's totally owned by wall street
we believe in americanism
she believes in globalism
and it's not that she believes in it
the people that give her all of this money believe in it
and she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe
believe me
that's it
what a difference between crooked hillary clinton and mike pence
mike pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy
radical islam
radical islamic terrorism
you saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window
you heard what he was screaming out the window
you saw it in san bernardino
you saw it at the world trade center
you saw it in orlando
how horrible was that
you saw it in paris
you see it all over
and hillary is a weak person
we are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party
we're going to change things around
there's going to be respect again for law and order
hillary clinton's foreign policy helped launch isis
you know, she's talking  i see the ads she puts on
if i make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests
got a lot of money
but i see the ads on foreign policy
she's talking about donald trump doesn't have foreign policy experience
of course not
i've been a very, very, very successful businessperson
i mean  but  but if you look at my calls, i said, don't go into iraq
nobody cared, because i was a businessperson
i was a civilian
take the oil
many, many calls i've made
you take a look
i said that in scotland and in the u
, that was going to happen
i was the one that predicted it
and everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong
president obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because i consider it a win
i think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do
and they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from
and i said that brexit's going to happen
i said that they are going to break away
and everybody laughed at me
and the odds were 20 percent
and then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, donald trump said this or that, but i'm the one that said it was going to happen
and some of the more fair reporters  about 30 percent of them  said he was right
i appreciate that
seventy percent didn't, so that's ok
so mike pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy
so important
now, i think if you look at one of the big reasons that i chose mike  and one of the reasons is party unity, i have to be honest
so many people have said party unity
because i'm an outsider
i want to be an outsider
i think it's one of the reasons i won in landslides
i won in landslides
this wasn't close
this wasn't close
now, this wasn't close
this was  in the history of the republican party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three
there were 17
we got  i say we, because i'm the messenger, i'm a messenger  i'm doing a good job, but i'm a messenger  we got almost 14 million votes
that's more than any other person in the history of the republican party in the primary system running for president
think of it
that's more than ronald reagan, who we love
that's more than richard nixon
it's more than dwight d
eisenhower
you know, he won the second world war, in all fairness
pretty good
it's more than the bushes
but i mean by a lot
i don't mean by a little
but that's with 17 people
people don't over-say that
that means our message is unbelievable
and i want to thank all of the loyal people  because i have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing
but they displayed it
it was on display, where we had this group of people, who  many of whom i've known, and i won't say, because for party unity, i'll say they're wonderful people, ok
never trump, they said, never trump, never trump
oh, we're going to win
they got crushed
and they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen
they're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start  and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers
we're going to put them back to work
so they're very tired of it
but i want to thank all of those people that  delegates that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something
did we show them something
and unfortunately, the vote was very late
but essentially, we had 112- 12
this was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight
we're not going to have a fight
people agree with what we've  they want the wall
they want the borders
they want these things to happen
and what we're doing
and what we're doing that i'm so proud of, so proud  and nobody else would even think about doing it  i fought very hard for it
we'll call it the johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals  and i want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, i could not have won this nomination
the evangelicals have been unbelievable
i dominated with the evangelicals
a lot of people were surprised
they say he's not perfect
but you know what
they know i'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart
and i said  and i said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do
you have the johnson amendment passed by lyndon johnson and his group
and he was a powerful president
he knew how to get things done
he got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him
but he was a powerful president
and we call it the johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status
we put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible johnson amendment
and we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let christians and jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk
i saw this
i had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top  the absolute top evangelical leaders, christian leaders, jewish leaders, believe it or not, some muslim leaders  people are going to be surprised to hear that  i had the top leaders up to my office, and i said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid
and they didn't know how to answer the question
and it took two, three meetings before i figured it out
one great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name i will not reveal, said, mr
trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues
we live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political
and i looked out the window
i was in trump tower, and i pointed to people walking down the street
i said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't
that means they're more powerful than you are
we have to do something about it
how did it start
how did it start
and they said, it started because of lyndon johnson
and he actually had a problem in texas with a certain religious leader
and he did this, and he got it done
and we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people, and not because they backed me in such large numbers, but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away
and we're going to change that
all right
back to mike pence
so one of the primary reasons i chose mike was i looked at indiana, and i won indiana big
remember, indiana was going to be the firewall
that's where trump was going to  they agreed i'd win new york, i'd win pennsylvania, i'd win all these places
but indiana was going to be the firewall
so i got to study indiana, and i got to study new york and a lot of other places, and i saw how nafta, signed by bill clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before
nafta, again, signed by bill clinton
nafta is the worst economic deal in the history of our country
manufacturing down in some states 55 percent, 60 percent
it's a horror show, moving to mexico, moving to other places
i have a friend who's a great builder
what he builds is plants
that's all he does, is build plants
he doesn't build buildings
he doesn't  he builds plants
it's the biggest in the world, from what i hear
i said, how's business
i was with him the other day
how's business
he goes unbelievable
i said, really, wow, i'm surprised
why is it unbelievable
because i think of him as building in this country
he says, donald, what we're doing in mexico, you won't believe
i said, what do you mean
he said, we're building plants in mexico the likes of which we've never seen
i said, what about this country
not much
not much
that's the expression
he said exactly that
not much
i said, but mexico
he said, you've never seen anything like it
it's incredible
folks, that's going to stop
we're going to go reverse it
we're going to bring our jobs back to this country
we can't be the stupid people anymore
and he was better than a pollster
he's better than a consultant
i would say, how are we doing
and you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars
doesn't cost me millions
me, i give them $10,000, ok
it costs other people millions
it costs other campaigns millions to get a report
every time they get a report, it's millions
but i'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report
and he said it
he didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it
just fact
how are we doing
unbelievable in mexico
in fact, he actually said, i've never, ever seen anything like it
and if you look, ford is building massive plants there instead of michigan
we want them to build them in michigan
they're going to build them in michigan
and you know that i know how to do that
so easy
so easy
but they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution
there are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here
there are consequences
and those consequences are going to keep companies in our country
it's very simple
and everybody here knows what the consequences are, but i won't say that because i'm much more interested right now in mike
indiana's unemployment rate  and this is the primary reason i wanted mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family  karen is amazing
incredible family
highly respected
expected to go for another four years
he would have won, i think, very easily in indiana
indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen, when he was there, when he started, 8
4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in may of 2016
since january 2013, indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs
you have to understand, i've gone around to all these states
i've gone to all of them
and every time, i have statisticians
i say give me the stats on a state
and it's always bad, down, down, down
down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases
here's somebody where it's gone up
private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013
that's like very unusual
governor pence balanced the budget
can you imagine a balanced budget
our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing
we're going to owe very soon $21 trillion
he balanced the budget
they don't know what that means
governor pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of indiana
it's also rated aaa, their bonds are rated aaa
very few states have that
aaa
the best
that's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, aaa
indiana was recently recognized by chief executive magazine as the number-one state in the midwest for business
number one
and it's not even close
there are approximately 34,000 fewer hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when mike pence took office
so you have fewer hoosiers, fewer people from indiana
and besides that, bobby knight, my friend, who really did help me
i mean, if you want a reference, bobby knight in indiana, we love bobby knight
but he agrees with everything i'm saying
he loves the governor
indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like i'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind
if you remember a few months ago, hillary clinton said really  they're doing much better, the v
is much better
they're doing a much better job than people give it credit for
people are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors
people are dying on  they can't even see a doctor
it's a scandal
take a look at what's happening with the v
in arizona
take a look at what's happening with  you know, just the veterans administration hospitals
it's a scandal
it's corrupt
it's incompetent
it's a scandal
and hillary clinton thought it was just fine
and, boy, am i going to win big with the veterans
i mean, we know that for a fact
so it's now 2
4 percent for veterans
in 2013, when mike pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6
7 percent
it was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best
got them jobs
got them jobs
indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates
that's a great thing
they're going to stay there
that's a great thing
and mike worked hard on that
he was telling me, that was not easy
under governor pence's leadership, indiana enacted the largest k- 12 education funding increase in the state's history
so you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education
isn't that a great thing
indiana has just about the largest school choice program in america
school choice is where it's at, folks
you want to get your schools better, you better get rid of common core fast
governor pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history
think of that
we're cutting taxes and balancing budgets
and along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country
cnbc ranked indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure
so with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up
that had so much  look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as donald trump
i build infrastructure
do i know how to build a wall
do i know how to build infrastructure
you know, it's very interesting
we're building  we're building  i won the  which is pretty amazing with the obama administration, but i won the right to have the old post office building on pennsylvania avenue, right near the white house, and it's an amazing  probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the gsa, general services
and i really like what's happened
we're going to have an opening very soon
ivanka and eric and don did a fantastic job on it
but i thought the other day, i was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year  actually more than a year  we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially
and the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do
and when i explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before
they've never heard them
so when i see what happened to indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when i see what happened to indiana under mike's work  also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at duke  who's now at purdue  when i see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened  almost has not happened in this whole country
the turnaround and the strength of indiana has been incredible, and i learned that when i campaigned there
and i learned that when i won that state in a landslide
and i learned that when governor pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember
he talked about trump, then he talked about ted  who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, ted cruz, good guy  but he talked about trump, ted, then he went back to trump
i said, who did he endorse
so even though he was under pressure, because i'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non- endorsement i've ever had in my life, ok
i will tell you
so with that, i would like to introduce a man who i truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the united states, governor mike pence
thank you
thank you, everybody
thank you
wow
wow
whoa
that's a lot of people
that's a lot of people
thank you, everybody
thank you
all right
let's turn that music down
we want to get to business, right
get to business
how is your governor doing, by the way
good
i think so
i think so
i just want to thank all of the people of indiana
you know, we had a great victory here not so long ago
and indiana was the state that put me over the top
thank you, folks
thank you
well, we have a lot of things to discuss, but we had some very bad news a few days ago, and you saw what happened
a lot of bad things are happening
and i was going to go through a whole litany of that, but we don't want to
we want to be upbeat
we want to be positive
we want to be strong
and we're going to be strong
we're going to be stronger than ever before
we're going to be greater than ever before
we're going to bring our jobs back
we're going bring our military back
it's being depleted so badly
we're going to take care of our veterans, which we have to take care of
we're going to get rid of obamacare, which is a disaster
and replace it with something terrific
we end common core
we bring our education back to the local communities like this local community where the people love their children and they want to see their children be well educated
it's so important
we're going to save our second amendment
we're going to save our second amendment
and it's under siege
you know, i wrote a few words today
and i think it's important that we go through it as a group
it's been a special place and you're special people
and i know so many people tonight in the audience
and you're all over
look at all those cameras up there, folks
look at all those cameras
they don't stop
they don't stop
but i just wanted to say i wrote this quickly, but it means it came right from the heart
and i have to say that our whole nation grieves and mourns for the loss of five heros in dallas, law enforcement
these were great, great people
great people
we pray for their families
we pray for their loved ones
we pray for all the wounded survivors
we pray for our country
it's so important
the police are not just part of our society
our police are the best of our society
remember that
we have to remember that
they represent our highest ideals, our greatest values, and our most noble characteristics
when our police are attacked, our entire nation is attacked
remember that
remember that
so the message must be delivered clearly for all to hear, the hostility against our police has to end, and it has to end right now
and we have to say together, and we have to be strong
we have to take care of everyone
the two people that were killed in louisiana and minnesota, it was tough
it was tough to watch for everybody here it was tough to watch
we have to figure it out
we have to figure out what is going on
was it training
was it something else
it could have been something else
we have to take care of everybody
remember that
but we have to also   we have to get to the bottom of things
we have to
but we can never, ever forget the hundreds of thousands of great deals and great things that our police all over the country do, and nobody recognizes them for what they do
and when there is a problem, as bad as these two situations were, and i personally think they were, they were bad
i hated, i hated watching it
but as bad as they were, they get broadcast all over the world for days and days, and all of the good things which are magnified thousands of times, nobody talks about
so we have to remember, we have to cherish and take care of our police
if we don't, if we don't, we don't have a country anymore
we have a country in chaos
and remember this
and i say it once, and i say it with love, and i say it with compassion
because i have love for our country, and i have great compassion for our people in our country
but i am the law and order candidate
we need law and order, and we need strength in this country
we don't have strength in our country
we have crooked hillary clinton, as crooked as you get
i mean, you saw that with the e-mails
it's a rigged system, folks
it's a rigged system
just remember it
it's a rigged system
it's rigged in so many different ways
we're going to straighten it out
you can't even watch what happens
we had a young man who did nothing by comparison to what she did, and he warned his friends of a problem that was coming militarily
and they came down on him with a vengeance
and they let her go
33,000 missing e-mails
they let her go
lies all over the place
and they let her go
think of it
it's a disgrace
so we're going to get on to other subjects
but i have to say law enforcement has to remain with us
we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement officials
we're going to do it
we're going to continue to do it
we're going remember that they do a fabulous job
we're going to remember that they do a great job
and every once in a while, problems will happen
and we're going take care of those problems
and they can be bad problems
but we are going to treat our police with respect
remember that
okay
now i'm looking at different rates and different crimes
and you see the crime rate in large portions of our country is going way up
you look at certain inner cities, and look at chicago
look at what is going on
since president obama became president, almost 5,000 killings in chicago
and nobody talks about it
well, we're going to start talking about it
because we have to make this a safe country
and, you know, i would say two weeks ago, a month ago, i wouldn't be saying these words
i was talking about the border
i was talking about the wall
and we will build the wall
that i can tell you
i can tell you
we're going to build it
don't worry about it
are you ready
who is going to pay for the wall
i don't hear you
who is going to pay for the wall
and they will
very much
they will
100%
and you know what
they'll be happy to pay for the wall
we have a trade deficit with mexico that you wouldn't believe
billions and billions and billions of dollars a year
we're losing on the border
we're losing on trade
and when i was in the debates and i mentioned this, people would come up that i was debating against, and they used to say donald, you're not really going to build a wall, are you
i say absolutely
they say but you can't build a wall
but i'm in the construction
you know how easy a wall is
a wall
we build 95-story buildings with bathrooms
that's tough construction, not a wall
walls don't have bathrooms
and bathrooms are always tough
but we're going to have a very big beautiful gate in that wall, big and beautiful
and that gate is going to be open
and it's going to be wide open for people to come into our country, but they're going to come into our country legally
they're going to come in legally
and there are going to be people that love our country
they're not going to be people that hate our country
they're not going to be people that we don't know where they come from
they're not going to be people that come from the migration that don't have paperwork, that don't have passports, that we have no idea where they're from
we have no idea what their motives are
we're going to say no
sorry
and we'll help
and in syria, we'll build safe zones, and we'll get other people to put up the money, because we're going to owe very soon 20 trillion, trillion with a t
nobody even knows what it means
we're going to owe   right now, can you believe this
$20 trillion
soon going to $21 trillion
so we're going get the gulf states who have so much money, folks
so much money
and we're going to get them to put up the money and others
and we're going to take care of people
and we're going have compassion
but we can't allow them to come into our country
we have enough problems right now
you see what happened in orlando
you see what happened in san bernardino
we can't allow it to happen
so we're going to build safe zones
we're going take care of people
we're going to have other people fund these safe zones
we're going to build up our military
we should have never been in iraq
but once we went into iraq, we should have never left the way we left
we left like fools
we went in, should have never happened
i didn't want to go from the beginning, and i have proof from the beginning
i didn't want iraq
i said you're going to destabilize the entire middle east, and that's exactly what happened
but then we were there
losing thousands of lives, spending trillions and trillions of dollars
probably in the middle east we're up to $4 trillion
and we're in worse shape now than we were 15 years ago before the whole deal started
far worse
not even close
far worse
far worse
so what we're going to do is we're going to start thinking smart
we're going to be smart again
we're going to make great military, and by the way, i said for years we've got to keep the oil
i said keep the oil
you leave, you keep the oil
we didn't do it
we didn't do it
i said it for years
once we were in, i said when we get out, it's going to be a disaster, but when we get out, we should have left some troops there
and i hate saying that
but we should have left some troops there, and it would have been better, certainly, than it is right now
can't be any worse
but i always said keep the oil
but we didn't keep the oil
so who has the oil right now
a lot of the oil is had by isis
and we created isis
and hillary clinton through her incompetence directly and indirectly created isis
and now she wants to get rid of it
she says yes, we will fight isis
she is the one that created it with stupidity, with stupid, stupid policy
policy that's only going to get worse
she is the one that created it
and that's what's happened
and so now we have problems all over the place
we have our cities exploding
we have isis looking at us
and by the way, when our enemies all over the world, including our friends all over the world look at what's happening to our country, where the other night you had 11, think of it, 11 cities potentially in a blowup stage
marches all over the united states, and tough marches, anger, hatred, hatred
started by a maniac that some people asked for a moment of silence for him
for the killer, for the killer
okay
so when our enemies look at what is going on with our country, they see our deficits
they see we don't win anymore
we don't win
we don't win
we don't win at anything
i always say when i was going, when i was young going to high school and going to college and before that we never lost
you know, united states, they said had never lost a war
now we never win
we don't win on trade
we don't win with our military
our military is so depleted, our military has fighter jets that are in use flown by great, great american people that are so old, and they can't get parts for the fighter jets
these are people flying these jets now in combat
they can't get parts
so they go to the plane graveyards in the deserts
they go to museums where they have similar planes, and they strip apart to use for our fighter pilots to fly
this is what we've been reduced to
and i'll tell you something
hillary clinton is incompetent, okay
the greatest single thing in my opinion that she's ever done is to get out of the e-mail problem
i think it is incredible
she did a great job on that
i think it is her greatest achievement
i think when they look back on hillary clinton, they will say the greatest achievement of hillary clinton was getting out of this problem with e-mail tz
houdini couldn't have gotten out
she was so guilty
i have a list
look
page after page of the lies   page after page of the lies
all over
look at this
page, page
look, i don't want to read it to you
the press would say, you should spend your entire speech talking about hillary clinton and the e-mails
i don't want to talk about it
you know what, it was all lies, folks
i don't have to go through and bore everybody
it was so horrible
it was so disgusting
it was so outrageous
you look at general petraeus and look at what happened to him for a tiny fraction of what crooked hillary did
you look at other people, for a tiny fraction, look at what happened to them
so i just tell you this, we have a candidate on the other side who, if she ever gets elected, it will be four more disgusting years of obama, it will be four more years of weakness, it will be four more years of civil unrest
it will be four more years of not winning with our military and not winning against isis
they don't have a clue how to beat isis
they don't have a clue
but it will be four more years of obama, and obama care and all of these things that don't work
except i think actually it will be worse
today i see bernie sanders gave her this very you know, sort of strange endorsement
i want to tell you, a lot of bernie sanders people are so upset about it, they are going to be voting for trump
i really believe that
they're going to be voting for trump
they are going to be voting for trump
because the one thing that bernie sanders and i have in common was trade
now he can't do anything about it
he just knew it was bad
i know how to fix it
because i am in favor of free trade
a lot of people say i'm an isolationist, when you lose $800 billion a year on trade deficits, maybe that is not the worse thing
but we'll straight it out
i believe in open borders for trade and free trade
the problem we have is that virtually every single country that deals with us are far sharper and far better
they have their best negotiators
we have people that are political hacks negotiating for us and people that don't know what they're doing
i have the greatest businessmen in the world that have endorsed me, including people like carl icahn, great businessman
we have some of the greatest negotiators, maybe the greatest in the world and we don't use them
we use political hacks
we have people in there that got in for politics
you could look at the biggest companies in the world, and it is small potatoes
it is peanuts compared to some of the massive trade deals
and we have people that should never be negotiating trade deals
just like we have secretary of state kerry negotiating with iran, and what they did to him and you because he has no idea what the hell he was doing and what he gave away, israel is in serious jeopardy, frankly we're in serious jeopardy, and we made a power out of iran
we made a power
number one, we should have never gone in and negotiated that deal until we got our hostages back
ever
ever
we should have never, ever gone in
and what you say is, folks, we have to get them back
and if you don't want to give them back, you leave the meeting
you leave the meeting
and you double up your sanctions, you would have had them back within 24 hours, i guarantee you that
but we dshtidn't do that
i kept waiting for the whole delegation, i kept waiting for them to leave, to get up and leave
i used to say get up and leave
perfect
get up
we didn't win anything
the only time that kerry left was at 73 years old to go into a bicycle lace where he fell and broke his leg, right
and i always tell people, i promise you i will never enter a bicycle race when i'm in the midst of an important nuclear negotiation, i promise
i promise
but when you look at it, number one, we should have gotten them back
and the other thing, we should have never given them back the $150 billion
and i would have said very nicely, my father used to think i was a little bit rough, and he used to go, easy, son
son, take it nice and easy
you have to take the lumps out
he had an expression
good father
we all have great fathers, i hope
i had a good father
but i learned a lot
he said, and he would go like this the lumps out
take the lumps
easy
nice and easy
take the lumps out
you're a little too rough
what do you mean, pop
you're a little too rough
and over the years, i think i learned that
made great deals and built a great company
great company
took advantage of every single thing you can because you are working for yourself and families and your employees and took advantage of the laws, some of the laws are the dumbest laws i've ever seen and so stupid but you take advantage of them
you're like a business person, right, got to take advantage of them
because you are really representing your employees, your company and your family
but my father would say take the lumps out
so here is what i would have said on the 150
in the old days when i'm young, i would say we're not paying you back the 150 billion, you're not getting it
and there could be a lot of hard feeling in the room
take a while   they will still come back, don't worry about it
because they need us
they need us
and then i would have left and here go the sanctions
i would have done two things
number one, hostages before we utter the first word
and number two   and how long were the hostages there
that negotiation took forever and we didn't win a point
we lost everything
they're going to be a nuclear power and they are rich and powerful
how about yemen
they are fighting on the other side of yemen
and they're fighting and wee fighting
why didn't they make the deal to get out of yemen and kerry said because he didn't want to come pliblg ate   complicate the negotiations
they don't want to bring something else to complicate it
these are amateurs
but my father would say take the lumps out
so here is what i would say
we wouldn't be negotiating because our prisoners would have been back years ago
i would have said, look, fellas, here is the story
we have a problem
our country is flat broke
we owe 19 trillion and going to be 20 trillion or $21 trillion with the omnibus very soon
i want to give you the money back, i really do
we don't have it, i'm sorry
they would have gone nuts
they would have said, what do you mean you have to give us   no, no, we want to
we don't have it
i want to so badly
we love you
you're such great people
such nice people
so kind
take a look at what they do to their hostage and prisoners and you'll find out about tough people
great negotiators
persians, great negotiators
i would have said, remember, nice and easy
i would have rather done it my way, but i respected my father
so i would have said, we don't have the money, can't do it
they would have left and we would have left and we would have been back in two weeks
we would have saved $150 billion
so those two things
we would have had our hostages back and saved $150 billion
now they are so rich, they are buying airliners, they are buying everything
they are buying probably nuclear weapons, we just don't know about it, okay
what the hell   do you have to   nuclear weapons, we're worried about them making nuclear weapons
they'll buy them
they have the money
they made such fools out of us
folks, those days are over
they're over
they're over
i call obama the five-for-one president
so we have a trader named sergeant bergdahl
so sergeant bergdahl thinks he likes their way of life, obviously
oh, they have a wonderful way of life
so one day he leaves
we lose five and maybe six, but five at least people looking for him
they were killed
they were killed by the enemy
they go out there looking for him
they knew he left
everybody with him knew he left because he was all whacked out and a believer in them, not us
so they knew he left
so knowing that, the fact they have a colonel and i believe a general talking to the people that knew him, and they told the colonel and the general that he left
he deserted
remember the old day, a deserter, what happened
bang
20 years ago, it was bang, but slowly
ten years ago it was long prison
today they are probably talking about nothing
that is where we've come
but i call him the five-for-one
so we get bergdahl, right, a trader
and they get five of the most vicious killers that they have, that they've been after for nine years to get them out and they bring them and they are back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody, including us
this stuff has got to stop, folks
and gitmo, we're not closing gitmo
we're going to fill it up
we're not closing gitmo
we're not closing gitmo
and i see hillary clinton said, i do not like donald trump's tone
look, here is the story
i think i have a great temperament
she uses the word temperament but i love when she uses the word tone
they are chopping heads off of christians and everybody else
we haven't seen that since medieval times
you read the history books, they chopped off heads
well, they are chopping off heads
they are drowning people in steel cages, by the dozens, at a time
and she says, we don't like his tone
let me tell you, folks, it is time for a tough tone
we've had enough
we've had enough
we've had enough
we've had enough
so we're going to do things the smart way
i remember during the debate they asked one of the folks on the debut stage who is becoming friendlier and friendlier by the day with me, which some of the people are recovering
it was   i'll tell you what
they say it was the nastiest primary that anybody has seen
they say the nastiest in recorded history
who knew what went on before recorded
but it was pretty nasty
and some of the folks, i saw one yesterday, i will not even mention names because i want to be friends with everybody, right
i want to be friends with them
except for the real enemy
but they'll sign a document, all right, it is called a pledge
i pledge   i pledge, i swear, i pledge that if i don't make it, i'm going to support the nominee of the party
it doesn't say, subject to change, subject to the weather, subject to the sun doesn't come up
it said, i pledge
and for that pledge, they got access to millions of dollars worth of material from the republican national committee, the rnc
reince priebus, doing a great job
and if he doesn't, i'll tell you
and if he doesn't over the next four or five weeks, i'll tell you
but they got access
so they signed a pledge they will support
i don't want their support
it won't mean one vote than perhaps their family
it doesn't mean anything
but i signed the pledge, too
and everybody wanted to sign the pledge
and the reason they signed the pledge was to get me to sign it
i signed it
i would have honored it
i said people should honor pledges
people should honor documents when they sign them
you know, not a big deal
not a big deal
but they should honor them
so here is the story, folks
we're losing our country
we're like a piece of swiss cheese at the borders
that is going to end
that's going to end
you know, the border patrol agents, 16,500, first time in history they've done this, they've never done this before, 16,500 border patrol agents have endorsed donald trump
they know better than anybody what is going on at the border
and by the way, if and when we win, it is we   i'm just a messenger folks, i'm telling a message of common strength but i'm just your messenger and i'm doing a good job as a maepgessenger, in all fairness, but 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed donald trump and what they do now is stand there with beautiful equipment, great people, people walk right by them
that is an easy job
they can't stand it
because they don't like what is coming into our country
they want to do their job
with me, they're going to be working really hard
and i said to them, when they called me to tell me about the endorsement, never done it before, they've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, 16,500, great, great people and i said to them, so let me tell you, i want to ask you this question   how important is the wall
they said, mr
trump, the wall is vital
i don't know what i would have done if they said it is not important
i would have said, i guess we're not building it because i respect these people, they know better than anybody
they know a hell of a lot of better than consultants and people making a millions of dollars that don't have a clue
who is better at that
i said how important is the wall
trump, never forget the answer, the wall is vital
it is vital
very important
very important
they actually said it is a tool toward real security, an important tool
and then i spoke with sheriff joe arpaio from arizona and he called me out of the blue and i've read about sheriff joe, i mean, he knows borders, right
amazing guy
tough guy
but he's an amazing guy
and he said, mr
trump, i just want to you know that i'm endorsing you because you know more about this stuff than anybody, you know more about this stuff than people doing it for 25 years
you get it
you know what is happening
i'm endorsing you
and he's actually a quality person
he's a tough guy
but he's a quality person
he gets the job done
amazing
so i know about that
and when it was coming time for the wall, i'll never forget, vicente fox, on one of the major networks, used the f-bomb
remember and i told this story a couple of times
he said, we will not pay for the f-bomb wall
and i said, oh, he's dead
can you imagine, headlines tomorrow
he used it on live television
and i said, oh, i feel so badly for the guy
and now in one way i was happy
because he used to say, we'll never build the wall
now he's saying we'll never pay for the wall
so we made progress
add least he's now admitting it is going to get built, right
and he seems like a nice guy but he got a little bit rough
we will never pay for the   f-bomb   wall
i said oh, the poor guy he is going to get killed in the papers
nobody mentioned it
can you imagine if i threw out the f-bomb
i think it will be the electric chair, right
would it be the electric chair
and the press, i will tell you   the people back there, and i will tell you this, not all of them, but many of them are the most dishonest human beings on the earth
they are the most dishonest human beings on earth
i've had days that are so good, and then you wake up the next morning and you say, man, did they take that
i won't even say what things   i could go one after another
and we don't make a lot of mistakes, all of us, we don't make mistakes but what they do is take a sentence and make it much different than what you said, much different from what you meant
and all of a sudden, they'll say, donald trump had a bad week because he said something perfect
perfect
okay
perfect
i'm telling you, folks, and i tell it all of the time, because as a republican, and as a republican conservative, we are at a tremendous disadvantage
you look at the way they treat crooked hillary, you take a look at this compared to the way they treat other people, or the way they treat me, they are some of the worst human beings on earth
i really mean it
i really mean it
you know, where are my protests
i want some protesters
you know, look at this room
the governor just said he's never seen a room like this in indiana with this many people
he's never seen anything like it
look at this thing
this is where your football team   look at the ceilings
everything is night
i always talk about the wall is going to be really high, but that is really high up there
that is a big one
but you don't see crowds like this
we have crowds like this everywhere, no matter where we go
and every time i go home and my wife says how was the crowd
and i always say, didn't you see it
they keep those cameras on my face, they never take the cameras off my face because they don't want people   i wish they would turn the cameras over here
take a look at this crowd
take a look at this crowd
look, the cameras aren't moving
they are really dishonest
i really mean this
they are so dishonest
that is why i love my protesters
because the only time they move the cameras are when we have a protest
if somebody were up there screaming or shouting, the cameras, which i used to think were in a fixed position, i said maybe mechanically they can't move, but when we have a protester, they turn and   they are like a pretzel all over the place
through the cameraman's legs, up around his ankles
you never saw cameras move like this
the fact is that you have to know what you're getting
and the system is wonderful in many ways, but really bad in others
and one of the worst aspects of our system is the dishonest press
the dishonest media is one of the worst things
i really mean it
they write and say things that are disgraceful
so   and i like to say, you know what, when people see or read or hear things, they'll say, i'll tell you what   one of the most incredible   people say what have you learned
i said, you know what i've learned is how smart the people are
because their rating is so low, they are so   thought of so badly, it is like how smart the people were
and i'll say this
various anchors, some of whom truly dislike donald trump have said what has happened to us   to us, i'm the messenger, you're the important ones in this whole thing, but what happened to us is one of the greatest political phenomenons they've ever seen in the history of the country
i didn't even know that
i didn't even know that
bill o'reilly, of course i'm on his show tonight so if you get home you will see the second edition
but bill o'reilly said, the single greatest political phenomenon that he's seen in his lifetime
now he's a pro
a smart guy and tough
tough
but the single greatest political phenomenon that he's seen in his lifetime is donald trump and all of us, the whole thing
we've been on the cover   we've been on the cover of time magazine, so much that it becomes routine
in fact, they just told me, mr
trump, sir, you're on the cover of time magazine again this week
i said all right
in the old days, i would say that is a big deal
and now it is like, really, that is good, that is all right
you're on the cover of time magazine
i'm not on the cover of time magazine
you're on the cover
just remember that
so we have a lot of things that are taking place
we have a baden emmy, we have an enemy that is dishonest and a press that is dishonest
we have a group of people that want to get elected who have a rigged system and who have really rigged the system to a large extent
they've really rigged the system
say what you want about bernie sanders, but the super-delegates, that was worse than what happened with us
and frankly, the only reason i could win is we won in such landslides all over the place, including in indiana
what a landslide that was
and we love bobby knight
do we love bobby knight
oh, that bobby knight
i love my bobby knight
we had so many coaches, gene and digger and bobby
we had so many coaches
lou, lou holts
we had so many coaches that came out in our favor
i do well with coaches
but the coaches like me
but bobby was out here working really hard
and i could see it right at the beginning
this was going to be the water shed
but bobby came out and i came out and we went to a rinas   arena arenas, you've never seen so many people
maybe you've been at some of the arenas
it is amazing
so here is the story, folks
we have to stop four more years of obama
we've got to stop hillary clinton, who is as crooked as they come
we've got to bring our country back
we have to make great trade deals again
we're going to make deal that's bring our jobs back
and we're going to get along great with these countries and trade with these countries
i am not an isolationist, i'm a free trader
but i'm a free trade tore make great deal   trade tore make great deals, not to make horrible deals
one of the people standing right there, said to me, mr
trump, are you an isolationist, and mr
trump   and i said no
and what is your definition of trade
and i said very simple
i know free and i know every form of trade known to mankind
here is my definition of trade
my definition of trade is that i want to make great deals for the american people
you can call it whatever the hell you want
okay
and we're going to
we're going to bring our jobs back
we're going to bring our manufacturing back
you look at what has happened to the manufacturing since bill clinton signed probably the worst deal economically in the history of our country, nafta
that deal was signed by bill clinton
you look at areas even from here, but you look at places, you look at places like new england and new york state and pennsylvania, great state   we're leading in pennsylvania by the way
it just came out
i hear we're leading in florida
i hear we're leading in ohio
i hear we're leading all over the place
and the rasmussen poll just came out, we're leading nashltionally
but we have a long way to go
we are dealing with a dishonest system and a crooked system and a rigged system so we have a long way to go folks, and we don't want anybody to take it away from us
and when this person said to me, by the way, what you've done is never done before, congratulations, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose the election, what you've done has never been done before, winning all of the primaries, beating great professionals and they are very talented people, it has never been done before, you will go down in the history books, mr
trump
i said do me a favor
don't even tell me about it
because if i don't win the next one, i will consider it a big, fat waste of time and $55 million i put up, and i'm still putting up a lot more
and now we raised $51 million last month and we started toward the middle of the month
and everyone was shocked
and much of that money came in small donations like $71 average or something like that
and i put up millions
but i did it, like, i want to incentivize people and i want people to realize, i'm raising money for the republican party and the rnc
that is what we want to do
because we want to keep our majority
we want to keep our house
we want to keep our senate
because i'll tell you what, if we can do that, and we have trump as president, we are going to be able to do things that are going to be so great for our country
going to be amazing
you know, we're run of the highest taxed nations in the world
and yet in going around and meeting with people, small business people, big business people, if they had their chance, and if they had their choice, they would rather get rid of rules and regulation   we have the worst regulations anywhere in the world
they actually would rather pay more tax, which is surprising, and get rid of these regulations that are choking everybody
people can't run their businesses
so we're going to turn things around
we're going to turn them around fast
we're not going to lose carrier air-conditioning from indianapolis
you know that deal very well
those people have followed me all over the place
1400 people, out of jobs, visually their moving to mexico
any of the carrier folks in this room
because we have   we have a lot   look at that
why are you in the back row
you should be in the front row
but we had   during the season, we had so many of them that followed us around
they felt so badly
we're not going to let that happen
people and countries take our companies and take our jobs, there are going to be consequences
they won't take them
because we're not going to let carrier come in and make air-conditioners in mexico and sell the air-conditioners to us, across a very strong border now, without consequence
and when we explain to the heads of carrier that here is the story, either stay or if you want to go to mexico, we wish you a lot of luck but when you sell your air-conditioners, you are going to pay a 35% tax for the air-conditioners to come across the border
and you know what is going to happen
they are not going to move
they're not going to move
this government was thinking about low interest loans, zero interest loans and ways to keep our kpzcompanies
you don't need that
they don't need money
they're making plenty of money
but we won't let them just take our companies out and fire everybody
these are people with carrier for many, many years
we're not going to let it happen
and we're going to have a country that is so smart again
so here is thetory, folks
we don't win any more
we're going to start winning
we're going to win with our military
we're going to kick the hell out of isis
we have to end it
we have no choice
we're going to take care of our vets
so important
our vets are being treated so badly
i have such great veteran support
we're going to take care of our veterans
we're going to have strong borders
we're going to have the wall   oh, that wall is going to be as beautiful as a wall could be
somebody said, mr
trump, sir, they're going to call it the trump wall
i said, well then i better build it big and beautiful, right
no, i don't want that
but we need   we need great borders
because without borders, we don't have a country
we're going to make great trade deals
our jobs are going to come back
we're going to make a lot of money on trade
right now we lose all of this money
you look at japan, the biggest ships you've ever seen floating in, and i was in los angeles, they float in these massive, massive ships loaded up with cars
and the cars are pouring just like   i mean, nascar
i love nascar
i love brian france
he endorsed me from nascar, right
nascar
it is like nascar drivers
king richard endorsed me
a lot of the guys endorsed me
richard petty
they come in and they are pouring off these boats
we send them wheat
we send them beef
and when it gets there, they don't even want it
they send it back
you want to see trade imbalance, look at the imbalance we have with japan
it will end, folks
we're going to have smart people now
we're going to make great deals and fair deals and get along great with japan
we're going to get along better with these countries and they're going to treat us fairly
and we have all of the cards
just remember that
we're the piggy bank
but they are going to break our piggy bank very soon
but with the piggy bank, they take the money out
we have rebuilt china
the money they've taken out of this country, i mean they have trains that can he can only dream about
they have highways that we can only dream about
places outside of this country in the middle east, different places have airports that we can only dream about
we used to be at the top
now we're like a third-world country
so here is what i say
we're going to start winning again
we're going to win so much
you're going to be so proud of your country
we're going to win so much
you're going to be so happy
you're going to have your jobs back
you're going to have your pride back
i often joke, you'll be calling up mike pence, i don't know whether he's going to be your governor or your vice president or who the hell knows
but you're going to call up   good man
but you're going to call him and you could either say, governor, or vice president, sir, please, please speak to mr
trump
we're winning too much
we, the people of indiana, cannot stand all of these victories
we can't take it
we're not used to it
please, we're winning with our military
we're going to beat isis
we're winning on trade
we're winning at the border
we're stopping drugs from pouring in
we're winning on education
we're winning with our second amendment
please, please, mike, help us
we're winning too much
and mike will come to see me
and say, mr
president, sir, they're winning too much
the people of indiana can't stand it
i say, mike, go back and tell them, we're not changing a damn thing
we're going to keep winning
and we're going to win at every level
and we are going to make america so great again, we're going to make america greater than ever before
i love you indiana
thank you for all of your help
you're really special people
thank you
we love you
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
thank you
it is great to be here
i'd like to thank alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us
today, i am going to talk about how to make america wealthy again
we are thirty miles from steel city
pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation
the legacy of pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great american landscape
but our workers' loyalty was repaid with betrayal
our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization – moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to mexico and overseas
globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy
but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache
when subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing
for years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment
many of these areas have still never recovered
our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families
skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away
many pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair
this wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class
it doesn't have to be this way
we can turn it all around – and we can turn it around fast
but if we're going to deliver real change, we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties
the people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything – and say anything – to keep things exactly as they are
the people who rigged the system are supporting hillary clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change
the inner cities will remain poor
the factories will remain closed
the borders will remain open
the special interests will remain firmly in control
hillary clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare america into thinking small – and they want to scare the american people out of voting for a better future
how donald trump says he'd win america's trade war
top u
labor leader blasts donald trump in dueling speeches
my campaign has the opposite message
i want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in america again
i want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who've led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another
our friends in britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders
i was on the right side of that issue – with the people – while hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president obama predicted that one wrong
now it's time for the american people to take back their future
that's the choice we face
we can either give in to hillary clinton's campaign of fear, or we can choose to believe in america
we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country
america became the world's dominant economy by becoming the world's dominant producer
the wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known
but then america changed its policy from promoting development in america, to promoting development in other nations
we allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable
trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result
i have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years
today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export
this is not some natural disaster
it is politician-made disaster
it is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over americanism
this is a direct affront to our founding fathers, who wanted america to be strong, independent and free
our founding fathers understood trade
george washington said that the promotion of domestic manufactur will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government
alexander hamilton spoke frequently of the expediency of encouraging manufactur in the united states
the first republican president, abraham lincoln, warned that
the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government… must produce want and ruin among our people
our original constitution did not even have an income tax
instead, it had tariffs – emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production
yet today, 240 years after the revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down
we tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free
as a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before
ladies and gentlemen, it's time to declare our economic independence once again
that means reversing two of the worst legacies of the clinton years
america has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 – even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people
at the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by bill and hillary clinton
first, the north american free trade agreement, or nafta
second, china's entry into the world trade organization
nafta was the worst trade deal in history, and china's entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history
it was bill clinton who signed nafta in 1993, and hillary clinton who supported it
it was also bill clinton who lobbied for china's disastrous entry into the world trade organization, and hillary clinton who backed that terrible agreement
then, as secretary of state, hillary clinton stood by idly while china cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property
the city of pittsburgh, and the state of pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the clintons put china into the wto
fifty thousand factories across america have shut their doors in that time
almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with china
it was also hillary clinton, as secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with south korea in 2012
as reported by the economic policy institute in may, this deal doubled our trade deficit with south korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 american jobs
as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs
trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back
to understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper
massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product
from 1947 to 2001 – a span of over five decades – our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3
however, since 2002 – the year after we fully opened our markets to chinese imports – that gdp growth rate has been cut almost in half
what does this mean for americans
for every one percent of gdp growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs
america's job creation deficit due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs – and that's just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put america back to work at decent wages
the transpacific-partnership
thank you very much
good afternoon
we continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak
it's been very devastating all over the world
a hundred and eighty-four countries
probably more
that number was as of a week ago
birx will walk through some of these trends in a few moments, but they're very positive trends for winning
going to win
we're going to close it out
while we mourn the tragic loss of life   and you can't mourn it any stronger than we're mourning it   the united states has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country, with the possible exception of germany
and i think we're as good or better
on a per capita basis   remember that
on a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of western europe, with the lone exception of possibly germany
this includes the uk, switzerland, belgium, the netherlands, italy, france
spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the united states, but you don't hear that
you hear we have more death
but we're much bigger countries than any of those countries by far
so when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the united states is number one   but we're not number one
china is number one, just so you understand
china is number one by a lot
it's not even close
they're way ahead of us in terms of death
it's not even close
you know it
i know it
and they know it
but you don't want to report it
why
you'll have to explain that
someday i'll explain it
since we released the guidelines to open up america again   and this was two days ago   a number of states, led by both democrat and republican governors, have announced concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual, and phased opening
texas and vermont will allow certain businesses to open on monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions
and i can tell you the governor of texas, greg abbott, he knows what he's doing
he's a great governor
he knows exactly what he's doing
montana will begin lifting restrictions on friday
ohio, north dakota, and idaho have advised non-essential businesses to prepare for a phased opening starting may 1st
throughout this crisis, my administration has taken unprecedented actions to rush economic relief to our citizens
as an example, you don't hear anymore about ventilators
what happened to the ventilators
and now they're giving you the other
it's called testing
testing
but they don't want to use all of the capacity that we've created
we have tremendous capacity
birx will be explaining that
they know that
the governors know that
the democrat governors know that
they're the ones that are complaining
through the paycheck protection program, we've already processed nearly $350 billion to 1
6 million small businesses across the nation to keep american workers on the payroll
so we're asking the democrats to get it done
this should be bipartisan
this should be 100 percent vote
and it's really been incredible
the $350 billion that's been approved is so popular, and it's keeping businesses open
it'll be open hopefully forever
our swift action is directly supporting 30 million american jobs
amy wright, from north carolina, as an example, said the program is a game changer for her and her family
it's coffee shops
and she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities
and now they're all staying, and they're getting paid
and she's got a dream, and it's going to take place very quickly when she opens again
so, amy, good luck
north carolina   great place
scott and julie alderink helped lead a church and own a restaurant in south dakota, with about 15 employees
they were already starting layoffs
layoffs were moving along rapidly
but now they've hired their employees back, and they can keep the restaurant open
and it'll be moving quickly   very quickly   as opposed to not having anybody and probably not having a place to have all of these people employed
she would have been out of business
she would have been done
the paycheck protection program funding is now fully drained
it's out
it's gone
three hundred and fifty billion dollars to small businesses
and, in turn, it goes to the employees of those small businesses
lawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay
the democrats have to come onboard
i used to read that these were democrat programs, not republican
it seems to have switched around a lot, hasn't it
huh
switched around a lot
the republicans want it
i think the democrats probably do too
but they also want other things that are unacceptable
this is about covid
this is about the plague and what it's done to us
this isn't about extraneous things that they've been trying to get for years and that our country doesn't want them to have
as we enter the next stage of our battle, we are continuing our relentless effort to destroy the virus
my administration is taking steps to protect high-risk communities by providing funding for 13,000 community health center sites and mobile medical stations
in order to equip them with the most advanced and robust testing capabilities, these sites are incredible
what they can do is incredible
the job they do is incredible
these centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions, including many african american and hispanic communities
we're taking care of them
and it's so important, because you've all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on african american, and you're reading a little bit less about hispanic, but likewise hispanic communities
the numbers are disproportionate
in fact, we're doing big studies on it right now
we don't like it
not right
nationwide, we've now conducted over 4 million tests, and deborah will be talking about that
it's double the number conducted by any other country on earth
so that's more than two times, actually, the number conducted by any other country on earth
you hear so much about testing
what we've done is incredible on testing
and i started with an obsolete, broken system from a previous administration   or administrations
but i would really say administration for a different reason because testing has become so advanced over the last number of years, and we have the most advanced of all
i spoke with other nations this morning   the leaders   and they all are talking about our great testing capability, and some of them want to know what to do
what   how can they get involved, because they need it for their own countries
in louisiana, massachusetts, rhode island, new york, and other hotspots, we have also tested more people per capita, by far, than italy, spain, germany, france, and the united kingdom, and all other major countries
so think of that
in new york, for instance, per capita testing is 6 percent higher than in singapore
in fact, there's a typo
it's 67 percent higher
that's a big difference
well, thank you very much, everybody
this is a group of people who, in many cases, became quite famous because they went through a lot having to do with the coronavirus
a tremendous amount
and a lot of them were covered, and we know them from the media
they've all got very interesting and very different stories to tell
and i thought what i'd do is i'd go around the room
it's an honor to have them at the white house
and they really are   they're very brave
some were right at the edge
they thought it was over
this is a rough   a rough plague
i call it the plague
i call it the scourge
i call it whatever you want to call it
it's rough
it's bad
and a woman that i've really found fascinating, and she's from a state that's a great state and a city that's been hit very hard   really, very, very hard   detroit
highly respected
she's a political person
she doesn't happen to be a republican, and that's okay
when things aren't going good and you get a little help from a republican, we'll take that too
but your story was just a fa-   just a fantastic story
and we're going to go around the room, each of you
this man was an nfl football player for 10 years, a friend of tom brady
and he was hit hard
yes, sir
and you weren't so strong when you got hit by that
that literally
no, i didn't feel strong at all at that point
yeah
you were   you were not   you were saying you were not   you didn't feel too powerful
so, if we could, we'll go around the room
and if we could start with you, representative
and congratulations
it's an incredible story
thank you
thank you, mr
president, and thank you, mr
vice president
it's such an honor to be here, and it's such an honor to be here amongst all of you survivors
i just can't say how wonderful it is to see your face
and thank you for everything that you have done
thank you
i did not know that saying thank you had a political line
i didn't know that
yeah
i thought just saying thank you meant thank you
and i do
i sincerely appreciate that, because had you not brought this to the forefront of   the hq   of being able to put this out here, i wouldn't be here today to even have this conversation with you and to be able to talk about the needs of detroit and talk about the people who really need this
and they need help
right
and you're here to address that
and i sincerely appreciate that from the both of you, from the bottom of my heart, and from the people of my city
well, you were so incredible, as a representative, both in terms of how you got better and what you went through
and your husband sounds like a great gentleman
he went down there and he took care of things, right
yes, he did
yes, i did
yes, i did
that means he loves you
because some husbands would say, egh, let's not bother
yeah
got the great insurance policy
he will do whatever he has to do, right
yes, he did
so that's   and that was late in the evening you did that, right
late in the evening
and we had the drugstores stocked with the medicine, and that's fantastic
why don't you   why don't you say what got you to go late in the night to the drugstore
what got me to go late at night   we were trying to do everything we could
she's real sick, so we kind of   kind of in a panic
and she's making phone calls
and once we got the doctor to put in the script
arsiwala
for christians all over america, this is holy week
we remember the resurrection of jesus christ
so important
but this easter will be much different than others, because, in many cases, we'll be separated physically only from our churches
we won't be sitting there next to each other, which we'd like to be, and soon we'll be again
but right now, we're keeping separation
we're getting rid of the plague
it's a plague on our country, like nobody's ever seen
but we're winning the battle
we're winning the war
we'll be back together in churches right next to each other
celebrate
bring the family together like no other
we have a lot to be thankful for
happy easter, everybody
well, thank you all very much
it's an honor to be with the prime minister of ireland
we've known each other now for quite a while, and we have a great relationship and a great relationship with ireland
and we have a lot to discuss
we will be talking about the obvious, and we'll also be talking about the virus that's hit the world
i see they've cancelled their big soccer games, their championship games, and a lot of other games
they've cancelled a lot over in europe and all over the world
so this is big world problem
we've taken some bold steps
we took the original boldest step of all when we closed very early with china
that helped us save thousands of lives
and we went very early with europe
and i think that'll likewise be very good, and hopefully we can get it back together very quickly in terms of reestablishing with china
that's on track to   something happened fairly quickly, because they've made a lot of progress over the last three of four weeks
and certainly, with europe, we think we can go, hopefully, very quickly
they have some hotspots that are really bad, but they'll get them better
germany, i guess, has some problems now
france has some problems   some pretty big problems
and italy, of course, is probably record-setting in terms of what they've gone through
italy is having a very hard time
but we think we'll reestablish very quickly once this ends, and it's just a question of time
and i think it'll go pretty quickly
stay away from people and wash your hands, and do all of the things that we're supposed to be doing a little bit anyway
but it'll be   it'll go very quickly
i know that   we were just talking   that ireland has closed their schools
and maybe i'd ask the prime minister to say a little bit about what you're doing in ireland having to do with that we're going through
thank you
right
right
sure
right
and we're making great progress there, i will say
right
well, they know, and i think it was made very clear last night who is and who isn't
and we'll be discussing that
we'll be discussing some other moves that we're going to be making
and i think it's going to work out very well for everybody
but it's a world problem, and you do need separation in some cases
you have some areas that are very heavily infected, and you have some areas that aren't, frankly
but we do need separation for a little period of time, in some cases
and one of the reasons the uk, basically, has been
it's got the border
it's got very strong borders
and they're doing a very good job
they don't have very much infection at this point, and hopefully they'll keep it that way
well, we get along very well with the european leaders, but we had to make a decision, and i didn't want to take time and   you know, it takes a long time to make the individual calls
and we are calling, and we have spoken to some of them prior to   some of the majors, prior to
but we had to move quickly
i mean, when they raise taxes on us, they don't consult us, and i think that's probably one in the same
they've done things   the european union, as you know, has done some very big tax raises over the years, not so much with me because i won't put up with it
but they haven't consulted us
in the case of the european union, i consulted with many people
well, it'll be a big impact, but it's a bigger impact, and it's also a human impact, which is more important, frankly, than the financial, when you lose thousands of additional lives
as an example, if i didn't close very, very early, leo   you know, we closed very early with china, and i took a lot of heat, including from you people
a lot of heat
they called me everything from a racist to everything else
it was terrible
and the same people, then they say, oh, he closed too fast
why did he close…   most of them said, why did he close with china
that turned out to be a great move
what we did with europe is   this was the time
and china   a lot of it came from   when you think of what happened to europe, because it was very fast and very furious, and what happened is a lot of people went from china into europe, and europe suffered tremendously
you know, you see what's going on
and so i just wanted that to stop as it pertains to the united states
and that's what we've done   we've stopped it
thank you, everybody
thank you very much
please
please
it's an honor to be with you
i have a whole big, beautiful speech to give, but i just gave two of them, and i thought we'd do, maybe, a little question and answer
you've heard it before and   so we could do that
i just want to say we've had a tremendous time in india
prime minister modi is a fantastic man doing a fantastic job
he's a real friend of mine
and, you know, you always say that in a guarded way
he's a friend, but he loves india
and i'm a friend, but i love the usa
but he's done an incredible job
and we're working together, i would say, better than our countries have ever worked before
i know many of the people in the room by name and reputation
incredible job that you've done
incredible job that you've done
really inspirational for not only your country, but really inspirational for anybody looking to be a successful businessperson
and there are plenty of them around
the job that you have all done is incredible
and we know many of you have invested in the united states, and you have to say, thank you
thank you very much, mr
president
you've made us even richer
but the fact is, other than yesterday   which was something pretty bad, with respect to the virus, and we'll see what happens   i see the futures are up today, up fairly substantially
but that's a very serious thing, but we think we're in very good shape in the united states
we've essentially closed the border to areas where we had to close them
and we had very few
we took in 32 people over the last two days because they were sick and they're americans, and they're great people
you know, what are you going to do
they're in quarantine
but we had, essentially, 12 people
many of them are getting better now
soon, they'll all be better, we hope
and we're watching very carefully
so we've had a very, very good stretch of   let's just say we're fortunate so far
and we think it's going to remain that way
china is working very, very hard
i have spoken to president xi, and they're working very hard
and if you know anything about him, i think he'll be in pretty good shape
they're   they've had a rough patch, and i think right now they have it   it looks like they're getting it under control more and more
they're getting it more and more under control
so i think that's a problem that's going to go away
but we lost almost 1,000 points yesterday on the market, and that's something
you know, things like that happen where   and you have it in your business all the time   it had nothing to do with you
it's an outside source that nobody would have ever predicted
if you go back six months or three months ago, nobody would have ever predicted
but let's see, i think it's going to be under control
and i think i can speak for our country, for   our country is under control
but again, we do business with a lot of other countries
we take care   we work with other countries
we want other countries to be happy, healthy, and well
they've got to be happy, healthy, and well
it's very simple
and so let's see how it all works out, but i think it's going to work out fine
i hope so
we're working very hard
we're spending a tremendous amount of money also on   we just asked for two and a half-billion dollars on getting everything ready just in case something should happen, and also helping other nations that really aren't equipped to do it
so with that, it's an honor to be with you
and if you'd like to ask some questions and find out how much you should invest in the united states of america, i'll tell you exactly where to invest and how to invest
we just did a lot of business with india, where they're buying $3 billion worth of helicopters   great helicopter
we have helicopters like   we make the best military equipment in the world, by far
and, you know, the prime minister actually said, if you were president 30 years ago, we'd have all your equipment
but they started buying many years ago from another nation and others
and now they're starting to buy from us
so that's an honor
but we're up to a pretty high number
we'll be up very quickly to a pretty high number
and we do make, by far, the best
and they want to have the best, so that's what we do
so thank you all very much
if the press wants to stay for a couple of questions   you know, we're going to be having a news conference at 5 o'clock, so you can go to that, or you could stay and hear some of these questions from   truly some of the greatest business leaders anywhere in the world
now, if you'd like to do   i could do this, steve
i could read the book for you and we could have nice, beautiful, little speech
it will take five minutes and you'll be   you'll fall asleep
and they'll be   well, they might find it interesting
i don't know about them, but you guys have heard it before
but please, if you have any questions, please
anybody
okay, let's go home
boy, we must have   we must have done a very good job if you don't have   do you want to say something about the energy business
go ahead
please
and how are we doing
it sounds nice
it sounds like a trump rally, actually
we're actually saying hello to the embassy people as soon as we finish
it's going up
it's going up very, very rapidly
thank you very much, dan
really, a great job
where is robert
yes, please
okay
good
would anybody like to say
go ahead
please
yep
good
great job
yeah
so which to you is more important
the tax cuts   we did massive tax cuts
or the regulation cuts
because i've had a lot of people in your positions running the biggest companies in the world saying the tax cuts are very important, but the regulation cuts may have been more important
right
for example,  business we have some issues, which
and we are
and we are  the skills, and we are going to work with ivanka
we have already  skill 1 million people
oh, that's fantastic
thank you
that's great
wow, thank you
so where else would you like to be, but a trump rally, right
hello, colorado
we love colorado, this beautiful place
and i'm thrilled to be back in colorado springs
i've spent a lot of time here, over the years
beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks
it's true of the rocky mountains, with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great american patriots
with your help, this november we are going to defeat the radical democrats and we are going to win colorado in a landslide
and you are going to help us get cory gardner across that line because he's been with us a 100%
there was no waver
he's been with us
there was no waiver with cory
we appreciate it, thank you, cory
thank you
this month, we mark a very special anniversary
seventy-five years ago this week, our brave united states marines landed on the shores of iwo jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war
it was a rough one
tonight, it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the battle of iwo jima
james blaine, donald whipple and john thurman
great, great patriots, very brave people
and tonight, we also honor the life and extraordinary   really of a very extraordinary american hero
one of the last known survivors of the attack on the uss arizona at pearl harbor on december 7th 1941
he was in the oval office just recently
a little while ago, about a year and a half ago, and we just want to pay our respects
you know, it is donald stratton, well-known guy, just passed away
sadly, sadly, he passed away just a few days ago
he was going to be here
passed away a few days ago, but he was great
i have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family
great, great gentlemen
so we were going to have four
we have three and we want to thank you for being here
thank you all
thank you
because america is truly a land of heroes
on behalf of the grateful nation, i would like to recognize the many veterans of the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars, who are here this evening
got a lot of them
great people, great people
this is a truly incredible time for america, we have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country
we are doing better than any country in the world that is not even close
and we've rebuilt our military over the last three years
don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half-trillion dollars, but when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets
right
we don't worry about budgets
we had to rebuild it, it was depleted, it was in bad shape, it was old, it was tired, we have the best people in the world, but that old equipment
now, we have brand new jets, we have brand new missiles and rockets
we have everything
all made in the usa
right
in my state of the union address, i proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
that's what we're doing, our country is stronger today than ever before
after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally failed
they have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had
today it just came out
and i don't know if anybody watched last night's debate
it got very big ratings, and you know what
mini mike didn't do well last night
i was gonna send him a note, saying, it's not easy doing what i do, is it
not easy
it's not easy mike
it's not easy for any of them
now, mike didn't do too well, he went way down
it's all right
mini mike
how about klobuchar
did you see her
she choked, she choked
she choked
she couldn't breathe
alfred e
neuman looked at her and said, something's slightly derogatory
and she said, are you accusing me of being dumb
who would make a statement like that
because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that
no, no, how about that
are you saying i'm dumb
that was the end of her campaign in my book, you know
you don't   to say that even if it's true, you don't say that, right
you know, they had a crazy person
on   today, on one of the fox shows
i tell you, fox doesn't treat us the way they used to
but we have the great show on hannity, we do
now, we have laura and tucker, and we have in the morning fox and friends, steve and angel
and brian's gotten much better, he's moving up
now, we have the great lou dobbs
lou dobbs says, he's the greatest president ever
the great lou dobbs, he says   lou dobbs, a year and a half, two years ago, he said, he's the greatest since reagan
then he said, about six months ago, he's better than reagan
and then he said, a few nights ago, he's the greatest we've ever had
i said, i said, does that include lincoln and george washington
he said, that includes them all
that's lou dobbs
like  lou dobbs
then you've got , and you've got jesse waters
how about jesse
and judge jeanine and even greg gutfeld
you know greg
greg, hated us, right
but now he says, look, whether i like him or not
he gets it done, it's all about getting it done
right
we're getting it done
nobody's ever done, what we've done
now, but fox says   and i don't know, it's different
it was different
in the old days, it was better for us
it was better for us
but it's okay, we'll win anyway
we'll win anyway
no, but they had this woman on   neil cavuto doesn't treat us good, neil cavuto
he's not too good
she said, i don't like him
nobody likes him
he's   right now, so you had, you know, remember last   in the ratings, you remember who was last in the ratings
he got fired, right
you remember, right
remember
he's gone and now neil's taking his place
neil's actually a nice guy, but you know, he doesn't like trump too much
and he put this woman on today, and she said, donald trump, didn't do well in the debates and he won
because she was referring to mike bloomberg, sometimes referred to as, mini mike, mini mike
and i said, wait a minute, i want every debate
it's true
and we sent them polls, poll after poll, after poll
not only won them, but won them by a lot, i won every debate
i'm not saying, i'm just saying every poll
you know, they do those polls right after three, four or 500,000 people
time magazine   i said, nobody's allowed to do that, you can't do that
we're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news
you know, they make up 90% or so
so where is dan scavino
where is scavino
does anyone know who dan scavino is
dan, bring me those pages up here, bring those pages up
see if you can get them
go get them
just it's such fake news, it's so disgusting
you know what
they do better if they told the truth, do you agree
they do better
someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when i'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us
they're going to miss us
you know, i told this story that a month before i ran, 2016, i was thinking about it
i said to my wife   who's become a great first lady
people love her
you know, they said, it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled
and i said, what the hell should i run for, if they're so great
but i remember, holding up the new york times and it was like a leaflet that you're given at a certain   like a supermarket, right
it's like, you know, the thing was blowing in new   it had no   where was dead, and now it's successful again
but when we leave, it's all of us, we leave together, we're unified
this is the most unified, the republican party has ever been
and when we leave, the new york times, thank you, the great dan scavino the most powerful man in politics
hey dan
so zuckerberg left, who is no
1 in the world on facebook
and i'm saying this in front of the fake news, because if i'm wrong, you're going to report me, right
who is no
1 in the world on facebook
he walked in, but that's us
he walked in for   we had dinner recently, just because i want them to pay taxes
i want to find out what's going on
but he walked in, he's smart and he said, i just want to congratulate you
small dinner, a few people
he said, you're no
1 in the world, in facebook
i said, that's nice
i said, who is no
he said, prime minister modi of india
i said, wait a minute, wait a minute
he's got 1
5 billion people and we have 350
so he should be no
1, but we're never going to give up that position of no
1 in the world, for our country, for facebook, for twitter, for anything
and they still haven't figured it out, they have not figured it out
but look at all that press, look at all that press
by the way, how bad were the academy awards this year
did you see it
and the winner is, a movie from south korea
what the hell was that all about
we got enough problems with south korea with trade
on top of it, they give them the best movie of the year
was it good
i know
you know, i'm looking for like where   where   let's get gone with the wind
can we get my gone with the wind back, please
sunset boulevard, so many great movies
the winner is, from south korea
i thought it was best foreign film, right
that's foreign movie
no, who is that
but on   did this ever happened before
and then you have brad pitt, i was never a big fan of his
he got upset, a little wise guy's statement
little wise guy, he's a little wise guy
anyway, but we're doing well
but here, i'll just showed this real quick, right
so this horrible journalist, she's is a real   you know, she's a trump hater
she gets   you know, she's worth zero ratings
nobody watches her, but she said, she was trying   look, bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night
he choked
here's another one, he's going, huh, huh
huh
oh, i can't breathe
i can't breathe
don't ask me the question, please
i look at my wife, i said, let's send them a little note
it's not so easy up there to do what i did
right
not so easy
but this woman who's a third rate, fourth-rate, she's been with everybody
every year, she's like with a different group, but i won't use the name because we'll make it too famous
it actually plays to their advantage, but she's third rate and she's on the lowest-rated show on fox, neil cavuto
so he lied, that's why
so she said, donald trump, didn't get good ratings
he didn't do well in the polls
he said, he didn't do well, in the debates
she said that, we were defeated in the debates
while i defeated crooked hillary every time and, by a lot
so wait
yeah, she's crooked as a three dollar bill
you know, i was going, whatever happened to the 33,000 e-mails, whatever happened
thirty-three thousand, she deleted them, and you know, as it, washed them and she didn't get in trouble
can you imagine, if a republican did that
they would want to bring back the death penalty, right
two standards, but i think, things are happening
i think, you know, i said, draining the swamp
i just never knew how deep it was
we have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe, and this is part of the swamp
so what happens
she said, donald trump, didn't do well in the debates
now, you know, remember my answer
rosie o'donnell, right
first question i've ever   and we took down the house, then the second brett perry sb
i had to raise the hand, i'm the only one i guess that raised the hand, right
and the place went crazy, because i was the only one telling the truth
turned out, i was the only one telling
and you know, the people get it, but she said, i didn't do well on the debate
i said, really
i won every single debate
we had 15 or 40 debates and we had the presidential debates with crooked hillary against myself
so here's one   i don't want it
you know, i   i am a little guilty, because these are all my friends, right
a lot of them are my friends
now, they weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy
try to be friends when you're competing against somebody, right
we are right about that
so here's donald trump, 67, the next one was 13%
the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1% and 0
all right, that's time magazine, all right, that's time
they don't like me, i don't like them either, by the way
although actually, i do like the new owner
this year, i got beaten out by greta
you know greta
last year, i got beaten out, i think, i've i've won it, but when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen
there's nothing wrong with it, right
i mean we've won it, but we should win it every single year
let's face it
and now they call it person of the year, they don't call it, man of the year
and i know the women out there say, isn't that nice
but a lot of the women out there don't like it
they don't like it
we could have a woman of the year and a man of the year
i like that
ok, here's the drudge report
drudge is starting to trip me good again
he started to like me again
i like him
look, trump and ted cruz, i can say, he came in second
you know, he was a great debater and marco came in third and a guy
i don't like much and they don't like him much in ohio, either
kasich, kasich, he was way down, way down
okay, look
who won
trump
here's another one, look
again a different one, time magazine
trump
33%
ben carson, good man, he was down
marco, jeb, ted, carly fiorina, name i haven't heard in a long time
what happened to carly
and rand, good poll
here's the story, look, but way up, way up
look at it
here's another one, look at it
trump
46%
i didn't make this up
here's another one, this is a different debate
i don't know, they're all different
i want every one of them
look, trump, i just took these at random
46%, second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%, trump 46%
here's another one, cnbc
well, you know the market it's been up there
they've actually been not so bad, and joe kernan is a good guy
he is a good guy
some of the rest, i don't care for too much
becky's like, she plays it a little bit down the middle, right
which is ok
trump, almost 50%, then they have all the rest of them, 14, for, three, two, 2
8, 2
54, 1
9, i'm not gonna give you the names
i won't tell you that, i got 48
8 and jeb bush   jeb bush got 1
the rest i'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter
you know, sort of a never-trump or i get
so jeb at 1
9, 1
1 and trump 48, that's another one
oh here's a nice one, here's a nice one
look at this, look at this
trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is seven, four, three, three, three, two, one, one, one
trump didn't do well in the debates, see, they are fake news
here's another one, trump kicked ass, trump kicked ass
trump 48, no
2 with six
here's another one, trump 75
6, crooked hillary is 24%
this was against crooked hillary
so look at that, trump was 74
6, crooked hillary clinton was 24
trump was 80%, crooked hillary was 18% and i've got this woman
you know who it is, right
and you know   you know, nobody knows it,  but everybody knows
neil cavuto, she has no credibility, and neither do you know neil cavuto
here's another one, crooked hillary   and by the way, one is a fox poll, one is bright bart, one is a drudge report, one is the patch, one is syracuse
com, one is public opinion
it's a good one but look at these numbers, trump 92
what is it
so i'm winning every poll
i beat crooked hillary
here's the one, trump 61, crooked hillary 39
that's what it is
and then i turn on the damn show, on fox, again, it's not the same
it was much better, it really was
it was much better
i turned on fox and i've got this third rate political journalists, if you call her that, saying, trump, did very poorly in the debates, but he became fred
no, i did great in the debates
i became president because of the debates because unlike mini mike, i could answer questions
and here's the final one, and i could get you another 15
these are all the ones that taken right after people call in
hundreds of thousands of people, they call in time magazine and cnbc
so here's a cnbc, crooked hillary clinton, 39%, donald trump 61%, and then this stupid person said, i didn't debate
well now, look you know, i don't mind
and you can have bad debates, but i won every single debate
and then i   then i listened to this, then three and a half four years later, i have to listen to a person saying, how we didn't do well because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world
take it, take it
take this
ok, let's get back to business
now i feel good
now i feel good
she's a third rate journalist
let's go, we're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right
while the extreme left has been wasting america's time and doing all sorts of vile hoaxes
we went through hoaxes, we went through the impeachment scam and by the way, cory was with us all the way
he didn't move, he didn't budge
he said it's a lot of bull
he said it's a lot of bull
but while they're doing that stuff   and you know, we're working with the cloud
we're working with these people   they want to take you out
they want to change the results, they got caught spying
let's say it like it is, right
they got caught spying on our election fake news
hey fake news, take the cameras for a change and show in the room and show them behind it
go ahead, show them the room
show them the room
you see, they never do it, including fox by the way
fox, is not that much better
we just got lucky because we have some   all that high rated shows, are the shows that like trump
all their loser shows like cavuto are the shows that don't like trump
how is shep smith doing lately, by the way
how's shep smith
he had the lowest ratings and now cavuto took his place, so that's ok
but they never show the room
my wife, a great first lady, she goes
i say, i say, hi honey
did you watch the debate
yeah
how did the room look
was that
because last night, we   i think we turned away 21,000 people
we had an arena that it held like 12
00, but we fill up the basketball courts, right
or the ice rink
we had to have 15, 60,000 thousand people
it was, like on fire, you all saw it
it was great
and she said to me, she said, darling, how did you do
i said, i did great
i said, did you see the arena
she said, no, they never showed the arena
you know
you know that guy dana white at ufc
well, you know, i won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right
i mean, he sold his crazy fighters
i mean, bomb, bomb, bomb
$4 billion he got, with 14 us, great people
but you know what
they're always showing it's full, it's full
these fakers back there, they don't want people
but i'll tell you what my wife said, they don't show it
but you can imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the lowest score
look, they won't show you, they never show you
and we've never had an empty seat from the day i came down the escalator, not one
and what these guys do, and what these guys do if mr
and mrs
jones, sitting right up there, beautiful couple, if she said, darling, i'm sorry
there's nothing i can do about it, darling
i have to go to the bathroom
he said, darling, i'll walk with you
the cameras glove on to those seats, they glove on and they say, there were two empty seats
trump didn't fill up the room
these are the worst people, but when i told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way
now, if we had a protester somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras they can do
they look like a pretzel
they look like a pretzel
they want to find this trouble
those same guys could   it could cover anything
i used to think, well, it's the equipment
it's very rigid they can't turn it
and then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest
we don't have it coming
they only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters, but if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around spin around like a pretzel
they bend, boom, they get   so that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment
now and by the way, i told them turnaround, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room
because it's fake news
while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with vile hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and tree, right
we added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month
way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be
two hundred and twenty-five thousand, think of it
we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country
almost 160 million people
and right now, since the election, we go by the election
jon has been doing this for 11 years, and he's done incredible
and so many people have such respect for him and   i shouldn't tell you this
should i tell it to you now or should we wait
so they're all saying, he's done so well
he's saved so many lives
he's created happiness in so many families
sir, would you consider jon ponder for a full pardon
and i love doing it
i love doing it
and we are   we are giving him absolute consideration, and i have a feeling he's going to get that full pardon
i have a feeling
i can't tell you, but i have a feeling
great gentleman
that's   first thing they said to me when i walked in
and   but everybody knows who you are
i know who you are
eleven years of this
that's fantastic
what a tremendous story
thank you very much
congratulations
because i'm going to give him an early congratulations, all right
that's big stuff
that's big stuff
so thank you very much, jon
and two years ago, i was honored to celebrate your story of faith and transformation as you stood with me in the rose garden of the white house
it was a great day, a beautiful day
now i'm thrilled to come to las vegas police department
and thank you very much for being   what a group that is
that's some job you guys do
some job you do
a lot of friends too
a lot of friends
to take part in your organization's hope for prisoners graduation ceremony
we are here to reaffirm that america is a nation that believes in redemption
and that's what it's about
redemption
we believe in second chances
and we want to bring returning citizens, great people   great people   in many cases, great people, and not in all cases
i'm not going to be too politically correct, fellas     right
not in all cases, but in many cases
we want to rebuild their lives
they want to rebuild their lives
they want to help us and rebuild our country
and, please, everybody, please sit down
a little bit late with that one, wasn't it
thank you
that feels better, doesn't it
huh
but to the 29 graduates
you're returning to your families
you have paid your debt to society and shown a commitment to change
you've overcome many challenges
broken free of addiction, learned new skills, and replaced old habits with fresh resolve
and jon told us just outside, a little while ago, that it's a   it's an incredible class   incredible class of talent
that word, talent, is very important
and now you have a chance to begin a new chapter that you are proud to call your own
and i have little doubt you're going to be very, very successful
your future does not have to be defined by the mistakes of the past
today we declare that you are made by god for a great and noble purpose, and you understand that
i mean, it's a great and noble purpose
and you're valued members of our american family, and we are determined to help you succeed and we're going to work with you
and you're going to work with jon and everybody else in this really incredible place that you've all put together, jon
and you're going to be so successful
you're going to say, i'm going to be more successful than trump
going to be more   and i'll be happy if you do it, i'll tell you what
i'll be very happy about it
but as long as you work hard and follow the law and do your part to contribute to your communities, your best days are just beginning
the best part of your life is beginning
i really believe that
and your greatest years are just ahead
and to all of the family members and loved ones   who have been through so much   of the graduates who joined us today, we know your journey has not been an easy one, but your love and support make all of the difference
and we are tremendously grateful for the families, the loved ones
and i know they're even more grateful, because without them, you wouldn't be here
you wouldn't be here
so i want to thank you
and joining us for this ceremony are two leaders who have devoted so much to advancing medical cures to help people overcome the stranglehold of addiction
sheldon and miriam adelson
and they've been great friends of mine for a long time
stand up, sheldon
what a family
what a family
and miriam is a doctor   a great doctor
she doesn't have to be a doctor
you can trust me   her husband doesn't need the money
but she devotes her life   it's the most important thing to her   to addiction
and every time she learned something new   and there's still plenty to learn   but she'll call me and tell me what they're learning about addiction
and the job you do, miriam, and what you've done, sheldon, just overall is incredible
and really great
two great people
just great people
and they like a place called israel very much
would you say that's correct
maybe i have to use the word love a place called israel, right
in your case
thank you as well to las vegas mayor carolyn goodman for being here
carolyn, thank you very much
great   great job
and also, the tireless advocate   because carolyn has been very much involved with criminal justice reform along with jared kushner, who has been very, very much involved
i don't know     i think   i think, jared, i'm starting   where is jared
thank you, jared
we're going to   he never wants any credit
he does a lot
he works hard
but that's working out very well, carolyn, isn't it
it's working out well for everybody
and tremendous support
and we had liberal support, we had conservative support
and they came to me and they needed some help, and we got help from some very unexpected places
votes
we needed votes
and we got some great people   republicans in all cases, in this case
but we got some great people to vote for criminal justice reform
so   in fact, very conservative republicans
so that was a good sign
very bipartisan
and it was a terrific thing, and we really   we did something that they've been trying to do for a long time, and we got it done
we get a lot of things done
we get a lot of things done
now, you see a lot of press back there
so before we go any further, i want to address today's sentencing of a man, roger stone
roger stone
he's become a big part of the news over the last little while
and i'm following this very closely, and i want to see it play out to its fullest because roger has a very good chance of exoneration, in my opinion
i've known   and you people understand it probably better than anybody in the room
i've known roger stone and his wife, who's really a terrific woman, for a long time
and roger is definitely a character
everybody sort of knows roger
everybody knows him
and most people like him
some people probably don't, but i do and i always have
he's a smart guy
he's a little different
but those are sometimes the most interesting
but he's a good person
his family is fantastic
he's got a fantastic family
and there's always a reason for that, isn't there
roger was never involved in the trump campaign for president
he wasn't involved
i think early on, long before i announced, he may have done a little consulting work or something, but he was not involved when i ran for president
and he's a person who, again, he knows a lot of people having to do with politics
his whole life is politics
that's what he is
and it's my strong opinion that the forewoman of the jury   the woman who was in charge of the jury   is totally tainted
when you take a look, how can you have a person like this
she was a anti-trump activist
can you imagine this
now, you wouldn't know about a bad jury
anybody here know about bad
these people know more about bad juries than everybody here, including the sheriff and the mayor and everybody
they know about bad juries
we're not going to say it too much, so let's not say it in front of more cameras than this
but you're my experts, okay
no, but this is a woman who was an anti-trump person, totally
now, i don't know if this is a fact, but she had a horrible social media account
the things she said on the account were unbelievable
she didn't reveal that when she was chosen
and she's, i guess, from what i hear, a very strong woman, a very dominant person, so she can get people to do whatever she wants
and she got on, and then she became the foreperson, forewoman, on the jury
and i assume they asked her a question
do you have any bias
do you have any
she didn't say that
so is that a defrauding of the court
you tell me
but does this undermine our fair system of justice
how can you have a person like this
did she delete her social account
and when roger was determined by the same jury to be guilty before the judge issued a sentence   and he was determined to be guilty   and she started going a little wild
she's very happy
and she started saying things that people said, that's strange
that's strange
and then they started looking at it, and how can you have a jury pool tainted so badly
it's not fair
it's not fair
and, you know, it's not happening to a lot of other people, because you could   look, i won't name names, but everybody knows who i'm talking about
what's happening over there
nobody, nobody
there are people that are even in roger stone's basic business of politics that were going to be in big trouble
well-known people
the biggest people
big trouble
they were forced to leave their firm
one man was forced to leave his firm and he was going to   bad things were going to happen to him the following day
nothing happened
nothing happened
he was the biggest
nothing happened
but it happened to roger stone, and it happened to general flynn
and it happened to   i won't name names
it happened to a lot of people, and destroyed a lot of people's lives
and i'm here to make a fair system
again, roger is not somebody who worked on my campaign
i know roger, but a lot of people know roger
everybody sort of knows roger
and what happened to him is unbelievable
they say he lied
but other people lied too
just to mention, comey lied
mccabe lied
lisa page lied
her lover, strzok   peter strzok   lied
you don't know who these people are
just trust me, they all lied
you had people that forged documents
you had people that wrote fake dossiers and brought them to the fbi, and used people in the justice department to get them to the fbi
and these people know   in the front row, you know better than anybody in this room what the hell i'm talking about, probably
so i'm only responding to you
i'm not even talking to the folks all the way
but they get it better than anybody too
a lot of bad things are happening, and we're cleaning it out
we're cleaning the swamp
we're draining the swamp
i just never knew how deep the swamp was
so if this woman was tainted, i hope the judge will find that she was tainted
and if she isn't tainted, that will be fine too
but i'm not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the united states
i want the process to play out
i think that's the best thing to do, because i'd love to see roger exonerated, and i'd love to see it happen because i personally think he was treated very unfairly
they talk about witness tampering
but the man that he was tampering didn't seem to have much of a problem with it
think they know each other for years
and it's not like the tampering that i see on television when you watch a movie
that's called tampering   with guns to people's heads and lots of other things
so we're going to see what it is
maybe there was tampering and maybe there wasn't
but i can tell you that there was tremendous lying
really, lying and leaking classified documents
that, you don't know about
but they leaked classified documents
you know, there was a young sailor who took pictures of an old submarine and sent them to his mother and a friend
and they destroyed his life
i let him out
they were considered classified
now, russia and china, i guarantee you, have the pictures of this submarine, for a long time
the submarine was like 30 years old
they had them in the first year
they didn't have to wait for the 30th year
but this is a famous story
and they had these pictures, and they put him in jail
he sent them to his mother and to his friend
his friend was not interested in what you're thinking
and there were many other cases where documents were leaked, even accidentally
it's so   classified documents are so important that even if they are leaked accidentally   now, hillary clinton leaked more classified documents than any human being, i believe     in the history of the united states of america
right
and she deleted 33,000 emails
and she said, oh
and, by the way, if you did it
five years, maybe more
okay
but you never have access to classified
very few people have access
she deleted 33,000 emails
i kept waiting
because, you know, they can talk benghazi
they can talk 100 different things
what people understand is when you get rid of this kind of evidence   so the united states congress said they subpoenaed her
they wanted to see her emails
after getting the subpoena, she deleted 33,000 emails
and they said   do you remember this
yes, the emails were about her yoga classes, her exercising, and her daughter's wedding
thirty-three thousand about her daughter's wedding
that must have been the greatest wedding of all time
and nothing happened to her
and yet, they'll put a young sailor in an old submarine, with a picture   a couple of pictures   they'll put him into jail
and i pardoned him because it was unfair that she was able to do it at the highest level, and his level wasn't   what he did was, it was confidential
confidential is a much lower class then classified
so i tell you this because it's interesting
this is part of our nation
this is what's going on now
so i'm going to let this process play out
and we want to have a great and fair court system
and i hope you had a fair and   you know, fair and wonderful court system
but perhaps you didn't
perhaps you didn't
and if you didn't, we want to straighten it out
but we have to straighten it out also at the top level
so we had a lot of dirty cops
fbi is phenomenal
i love the people in the fbi
but the people at the top were dirty cops
and if you would have read the report written about comey   78 pages of kill, with a reference of go get him
they really said it
go get him
and then you read about mccabe and you see what they said
it's so bad
and we're just waiting
i'm not doing any   i'm just sitting here, standing here, talking to you
we're waiting
so i just want to let the fake-news media know that     i just want to let them know, because there's few people more dishonest than these people, i will tell you that
and you have some very good ones
a hell of a lot more dishonest than most of you in the audience were
but i'm going to let the media know that i'm going to watch the process
i'm going to watch it very closely
and at some point, i'll make a determination
but roger stone   and everybody   has to be treated fairly
and this has not been a fair process
okay
thank you
so when i ran for president, i pledged to fight for those who have been forgotten, neglected, overlooked, and ignored by politicians in our nation's capital
and you understand that very well
for decades, no one was more forgotten than citizens coming out of prison who were ready to go into a brand-new, beautiful start but couldn't find a job
they couldn't find people who believed in them
and one of the great things that happened is i, and my administration, and a lot of very talented people that work with me, we created the strongest economy in the history of our country
we have the best unemployment numbers
we have the best unemployment numbers for african american
best in history
asian american   best in history
hispanic american   best in history
our country is booming
we've never done better
it's the best economy we've ever had
so when people come out   as an example, yourselves
you're going to get great jobs
and i'll tell you the end result   and we do studies on this
people with businesses are going to hire you
they want you more than you want them
this is the first time this has happened
okay
this is the first time
they want you to do it
and they wouldn't have given you that second chance
we call it second chance
but they wouldn't have given you that second, and in some cases, a third chance
that's okay
but they wouldn't have given you that second chance
now they're doing it because they need people, because the economy is so good
and i'll tell you the end result
employers are calling
the numbers that we're getting, the respect that you're getting from people that are doing the hiring   they can't even believe it
i had one gentleman, i talked to him   he had seven people came out of prison
he's got seven people working for him
he said, they're among my best
he said, they are among my best people
he said, i cannot believe it
and you know what
always work out
i'm not going to say everybody is perfect because it's not
nobody is   you take a group, there's always going to be somebody that doesn't work out
but he said, i can't believe it
they are
he's got seven now
they've been with him for quite a while
he said, they are among the best people i have ever employed
he is so happy
it's going to happen with you
it's going to happen with them
what do you think
i think it's going to happen with this group
so once i came into office, leaders from all different backgrounds asked me to make changes to our criminal justice system
and the more i learned about the issue   a big issue   the more i knew that criminal justice reform was really not about politics
because you have people that are for and against it on all different levels   republican, democrat, conservative, independent, liberal
some love it, some don't love it, but they're starting to love it
we're having tremendous success with it
and it's about doing the right thing
because alice johnson   you know, i've really gotten to know her well
and she's like an incredible person
and because of alice, we're taking in   we've just let out three other people that she knew
and i say to people, and you may have references and recommendations when you were   wherever you may have been, frankly
you know some people that were really good people who
alice was in for 22 years
she had another 18 years to serve, and   for a crime, but not that kind of a crime
and i learned about alice johnson
and when i learned, it really   you know, it was really something special
she's an incredible woman
she came out of prison
you've seen the whole thing
we actually did a commercial on it
i did the commercial for people to see what this is all about
she came out   you couldn't hire an actor in hollywood to have the emotion and the love and the tears and everything
she came out and she saw her family, who had totally grown up without her
and some big, strong young men
some wonderful women
just all family
and she was grabbing them and they were all hugging and kissing outside of this massive prison wall
and they were just screaming with joy
it was an incredible thing to see
you couldn't   you couldn't do it
it had to be natural
it had to come from the heart
it had to come from the heart
so it was really   so i say to alice, and i say to other people, and i'll say to you, and i'll say to you   you're going to have some recommendations
do you think i'm making a mistake with him
what do you think
okay
but you're going to have some recommendations
i want your recommendations
because you have   we have thousands of people in prison that have stories like alice johnson
thousands and thousands of people
and i love doing it
i love doing it
and, you know, you can be poor
you can be middle income
you can be rich
it's   injustice is injustice
but you have thousands of people that shouldn't be there
and i love finding those people
so, as you find them, as you really think   but you can't let me down
they've got to be right
because there are some people you don't want to do this with
well, i've known you for a long time, geraldo, and it's been a lot of good   a lot of good times
well, it's a terrible thing and you know i think of nixon more than anybody else and what that dark period was in our country and the whole thing with the tapes and the horror show, it was dark and went on for a long time and i watched it
i watched ronald reagan, where they were very close with iran-contra, and that was very dark
he went through that for years and never really got over the spell
it was dark but not nothing like nixon
i would always think what   every time in the white house i passed this beautiful portrait of various presidents, right
but the portrait of   of richard nixon, i sort of   i don't know, it's a   it's a little bit of a different feeling that i get from looking at the other portraits of presidents
and i got impeached for no reason whatsoever
partisan, totally partisan based on a perfect phone call and a totally appropriate phone call that was even said by the other party to be perfect, the president of ukraine
and it was a disgraceful act by nancy pelosi and these horrible people
and
she is a person that started an impeachment and lost
so she goes down as a loser which she is
nancy pelosi was   it was said sadistically
if you watch the way she said that with the hatred and the venom coming out of her ears, you just take a look at that, the hatred that was pouring from her when she said that
my wife was sitting there and watched it and she said, oh my, that was horrible
the way she said it was so bad
it's interesting that you picked it up
some people did some people didn't
it wasn't just the words it was the   the craziness
and then to have her sitting behind me at the state of the union mumbling all night long, mumbling, you know, talking to me but under her breath
not actually
tearing it up and i think they lost very big
you know, our poll numbers are through the roof and everything else
but i will say that for my family, it was a very tough thing
me, i'm so busy that, you know, i literally   it just made my job so much busier
and yet we've accomplished more than any president in his first year or three years that we've ever had, geraldo, i mean, you can go to anybody and nobody has done what i've done in three years
and i had this all cloud of bad people making up things
i mean, it's terrible and you know, to see
well, it was hard especially since they knew i did nothing wrong
i did absolutely nothing wrong
everybody knew it
romney knew it too, by the way
you know that was a disgrace and he knew it
he was going to vote with us
it was   everyone is saying, no, he's good, he's good
then he went into a cage and he   he went into a cage with, i guess, they   they held it
he did an interview with your friend, chris wallace, and nobody know   knew what the interview was about
but it was, you know, previous to the vote and you know he's a wise guy
he did a   he did a handle
he did a twitter handle with a phony name on it so he could criticize people without using his name, so he could say things great about himself
he'd tweet about how great he is
i'm talking about mitt romney
how crazy, you know, how crazy that was
and he got caught
but now that was a disgraceful
no, i don't think that at all
they did   reports said he didn't
they brought up his religion very seldom and all of a sudden he brought up his religion
when did you hear him bring up his religion
they did a report in one of the main papers that he very rarely brought up his religion
no, i don't think so
look, i got fifty-two-and-a-half votes out of 53
i got fifty-two and a half
and i guess it was the religion, he should have voted for the other half
you know, he was   he voted on one positively and the other negatively
he should have probably  his religion
should have voted on both of you, if you think about it
but no, i know he's just a bad guy
you know, he's a jealous angry person,
no, i think we just had our difficulties
you know, i thought he should have won against president obama in the second term
i thought that should have been easy
i don't   i'm not a mccain fan, never was
but i didn't think he could have possibly won that one because, you know, he was handed over, sort of a rough time in terms of many different things
and first african-american, i said that the whole thing was really stacked against mccain
and again, i'm not a fan, but i never said he should have won
but the second, the obama
well, let me get this first
the obama first term was a disaster
the obama's second term was ok
mitt romney should have beaten obama and he should have beaten him easily
and i would have beaten him more easily than i beat hillary clinton
as far as the obama doing, he took over a   something that was a mess but rather easily fixed
so you can get some pretty good numbers
it's the slowest recovery we've had since the great depression under obama, and now the recovery is a monster
and i will tell you, a big part of our recovery, bigger even than the tax cuts were the regulation cuts, which they would never have done
they were going to put more regulations on
if hillary clinton had got elected instead of 30,000   we're almost up to 30,000, which is going to be a record
on the dow 29,342 as of this moment
so we
nobody thought that would even be possible
and don't forget, they're trying to take credit for that big spread
if you look at the spread, when i won, the market went through the roof
had i lost the market would have gone down tremendously
but when i won, the market, immediately, you remember that big day right after the victory
well, you can't really give credit to them for that
that's   that has to go to me
i say i should get credit from election day
but president obama
well, we're working on it very closely
i spoke to president xi two days ago
they're working on it very professionally
it's a problem, we think and we hope, based on all signs that the problem goes away in april because   which is not too far down the road, because he kills this virus
we think, now we're going to find out, geraldo, but we think, and they are having difficulty in china but they're working very, very hard
we're working with them
we're sending a lot of people and cdc has been great but it is   it's a problem in china
has not been spreading very much
in our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered
so it's actually less
well, you never know
i think they want to put the best face on it
so you know, i mean, if somebody   if you were running it, you'd probably   you wouldn't want to run out to the world and go crazy and start saying whatever it is because you don't want to create a panic
but, no, i think they've handled it professionally and i think they're extremely capable and i think president xi is extremely capable and i hope that it's going to be resolved
again, the april date is very important
but you know this is a big thing
the april date is very, very important because if that's the case, if he does, in fact, kill that's when it starts getting hot and this virus reacts very poorly to heat and dies
so we'll see what happens
well, i inherited   i inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations and they worked there for years and with civil service and with unions and all of it
you can't do what you'd like to do
in addition, you want to give people chances
you know the fact that they come from obama or they're never trumpers from bush or whoever it may be, you know, and then you go back and you   you have people you have clinton and you want to give people time
now, but vindman   if you look at what his person said about him, morrison, who i think there's a very good man
he said terrible things about vindman
no, i didn't want him in
i watched his testimony
don't forget he was the one that thought my goal was bad and he ran in and started saying, you know, terrible things about the call and then when i released the transcript that call was perfect and i say it again, it was perfect
it was totally appropriate
and it wasn't one call it was two calls
they were both perfect appropriate calls and nothing earthshaking there
well, that's what they've done over the years
when you call a foreign leader, people listen
i may end the practice entirely, i may have   i may end it entirely
sometimes you have 25 people
now, you have a  you have secretary of state versus mike pompeo, was on the call, he found the call to be perfect
he found the call to be absolutely fine with many people on the good
the only one, this guy ran and said he didn't liked the call
first of all, there's very insubordinate
why wouldn't he go to his is immediate, you know, he went to congress or he went to shift or he went to somebody
but vindman was a guy that when we took him out of the building the building applauded
i don't know if you heard that
that's the whole building that a lot   many of the people in the building started applauding
no i'm not a fan of vindman
i'm not a fan of what   i've never   i don't think i've ever met him, by the way, just so you understand, many of these people i've never met but i'm not a fan of vindman, no question about it
and even if i just based it on what jim morrison said, i would not be a fan
these are mueller people
the whole mueller investigation was a shakedown and a disgrace
it probably should be expunged because, to be honest with you, the dossier now, everybody knows it was fake
everything was based on the dossier, the dossier now is totally fake
they used the dossier knowing it was fake to get pfizer warrants
that means they got pfizer warrants illegally
that was where they did the whole situation with the mueller report
much of the mueller report and even these attorneys, i know at least a couple of them were mueller people
what they did to roger stone was a disgrace, in terms of everything, right from the beginning
twenty-nine fbi agents loaded up with the most powerful rifles and machine guns, they attack him early in the morning
his wife has a tremendous hearing problem, virtually no hearing
they barged into their bedroom
this is early in the morning
cnn following them
so they were obviously alerted
you know nobody has been able to figure that one out and they should be able to figure it out, it is really easy to figure it out if they wanted to
cnn was following them
cnn taped it all and how would you like to be roger stone
and yet, if you look at podesta's brother, hillary clinton's campaign manager, look at the brother   was it tony podesta
but look at the brother
he   he was paul manafort on steroids
he was the biggest one or one of the biggest in washington
they found him doing many bad things, he was forced to leave his firm
he was going to be   i don't   it was going to be a very serious day the following day after he left his firm, you understand what i mean by that
hello, manchester, and i am thrilled to be in the great state of new hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in god, family, and country
thank you
thank you
and i'll tell you what
we have more in this arena, and i hate to say this to you, we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in
so if you'd like to give up your seat or where you're standing, sorry, we couldn't get you seats, but if you want to give it up, let them come in
you go out
does anybody want to make that deal
i don't think so
but we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates, meaning the democrats, put together and multiplied times five
and the fake news   these guys will never report that
they'll never report
they don't even like showing the crowd
they always show my face
they never show the crowd, but you know what
the people can hear the crowd
the people can hear the crowd
they know
that is not the sound of 200 people
one of their prime candidates today, they weren't a big deal
they had exactly 104 people
and the fake news said, it was a nice crowd, very nice
if i had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, they'd say, he didn't sell out
but you know what
we have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and i came down the escalator
never
and we have the biggest arenas in the country
with your help, on november 3rd, we are going to defeat the radical socialist democrats
we are going to win new hampshire in a landslide
this is a truly incredible time for america
we have the best economy we've ever had, the most prosperity
we have got the most prosperity we've ever had
by the way, we're going to keep it that way, too
it's ok
and we've just built the most powerful military anywhere in the world that was totally depleted
now, it has all brand-new jets
it's got brand-new missiles and rockets, and everything you can imagine
and if it hasn't been shipped yet, it's going to be shipped soon
on tuesday, i delivered my address on the state of the union
and i had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly, mumbling, mumbling rah-rah, ho-ha
who was mumbling, very distracting, very distracting
that was very distracting
i'm speaking, and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry
there was a little anger back there
we re the ones who should be angry, not them
we're the ones who should be angry
but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great american comeback
our country is stronger today than ever before
and the day after my address, our good republicans in the united states senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete, and absolute total acquittal
and it wasn't even close
and i want to thank our republican senators and our republican house members
they were tremendous
in the house, we won 196 to nothing, and then we got three democrats
and in the senate, other than romney, we had    we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing
that's something
and in one case, we got 53 to nothing, but i don't even count that, to be honest with you
the radical left's pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes
think of that 18 votes to spare
we had a lot of votes to spare
and also, very importantly, as of today, i, we   cause it's we
it's not i
it's we
it's all   we're all in this together
we have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had
thank you, nancy, very much
thank you
while the extreme left has been wasting america's time with this vile hoax, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our borders, and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed
from our rural communities to our cities, we are expanding the blessings of america to all of our citizens
we added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone
amazing
and i listened, i watched, and all these experts, they would say, yes, i think 60,000
another one said 101,000
another one said 125,000
another one was 118,000
and then the number came out 225,000
pretty good, pretty good
we have destroyed the isis caliphate
we killed the founder and leader of isis
al-baghdadi is dead
al-baghdadi is dead
and we just took out the world's top terrorist, qasem soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever
the fact is america is respected again
it's been a long time
but as we keep on winning washington democrats, keep on losing their minds   they're crazy
that's why millions of registered democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement
they're joining our great republican party
now i can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because, you know, you have some pretty strange election laws here, right
remember last time we won the primary tremendously
we should've won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses
and it was very, very close, even though they did
but this year, you know you have a great governor, governor sununu, great governor chris
and now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it'should be a lot different
but we have done great
this has been an incredible state for us
it's a state where the people are great, just great people
and we hear that there could   because you have crossovers in primaries, don't you
so i hear a lot of republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the democrats
does that make sense
you people wouldn't do that
my only problem is i'm trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate
i think they're all weak, one or the other
we proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission, a very simple mission, remember, make america great again
and then after we make it great again, which we already have   we've had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high, 141
think of that
out of three years, 141
and to me, i view it differently
well, look at your 401(k)s
i mean, who is doing well with their 401(k)s
up 90%, up 104%
is there anybody doing badly with a 401(k)
i'd like to not talk to that person
does anybody have a 401(k) where they're doing badly, please
oh, don't put up your hand
i don't believe you
now, the 401(k)s, they're up 90%, 95%
i always tell this story
people come up to me
they say, i want to thank you
my wife thinks i'm a total loser, sir
she thinks i am the worst person with money, with financial
she thinks i'm just horrible in the last three years
i'm up 94%, sir
she thinks i'm a total genius when it comes to filing
she loves me again
she didn't love me before, sir
she loves me again
that tells you something about money, doesn't it
the first step to victory in november is tomorrow
go send a message that republicans   and you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want
don't worry about it
i don't really think we actually have a candidate against us
that republicans are energized, that we're united and that nine months from now, we are going to take back the house of representatives
we are going to hold the senate, and we are going to keep the white house
you know, they always talk about the democrats
they have enthusiasm, right
we have so much more enthusiasm, and it's not even close
they're all fighting each other
they're all going after each other
you got them all over the place
i don't know what the hell they're doing
they don't know what they're doing
they can't even count their votes
we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country, great national leaders
i want to thank our tremendous vice president mike pence, who spoke earlier this evening
and also with us are warrior senators
the two people that wanted to be here, they're going to be here tomorrow
they're going to be here to get out to vote
i don't think we have to worry too much about it, but that's ok
and the very highly respected senators lindsey graham and rand paul
great guys, warriors
they re warrior
hey, lindsey and rand, that's not bad
can you imagine if you actually came from new hampshire, i mean, right
that's not bad
but they have been great
all they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months
they said, read the transcripts, please
read the transcripts
but i want to thank you both very much
two great people, two great friends
man, look at all that television back there
whoa
that's bigger than those terrible academy awards, i got to tell you
that used to be big, not so much anymore
a friend of mine, another great leader and somebody that's going to be speaker of the house, hopefully, next year, kevin mccarthy, our leader, kevin mccarthy
oh, will that be nice to have kevin, a pro
you'll see things get done like you'll never believe
thank you, kevin, very much
great
a very brave man, he took the bullet
he got shot and he got up
he was going to die that night
i tell the story all the time
his wife, she was crying so much
when he finally did awake, i said, well, one thing i learned, your wife loves you
why do you say that
because she was devastated
i know many wives that don't get too upset
his wife was devastated
his family was devastated
the doctor told me he didn't have a good chance, but he's tough as hell
and he's a really terrific friend
he's a winner
he put himself back into shape
he actually looks better now than he did before he got shot

you're going to win
we won by a lot, right
we had actually a total of 18, and we won
we had a tremendous night, and i've never forgotten it
and there was a friend of ours, chairman of the new hampshire republican party, steve stepanek
steve stepanek
that was a big evening
and three friends of mine that are co-chairman
al baldasaro, fred doucette, and lou gargiulo
thank you all very much
and david and corey, thank you also for being here
also, a woman that not too many people know, very powerful, very smart, very beautiful, even though i'm not allowed to say that because she's my daughter, ivanka
come on up, ivanka
and jared who is making deals that are so good for this country
people have no idea what's happening
i will tell you, we are making trade deals and other deals, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before jared kushner
thank you, jared
thank you
and kimberly, thank you so much
i heard your speech on the plane on the way in
i was very impressed
and did don, jr
make a good speech
don
they re good kids
they went through a lot with this hoax
i want to tell you, they went through a lot with the hoax
a woman who headed up the great state of michigan
you know, the republicans hadn't won it for 30-some-odd years
you don't win michigan, they said
i said, really, every time we had   we have crowds like this
why aren't we going to win
we did our final speech at michigan
in fact, we left new hampshire
we went   we just added it on because our opponent heard that they were in trouble, and they were in trouble because we won the great state of michigan
and helping us was the rnc chairwoman, ronna mcdaniel
great job
i said, get me the woman from michigan to head up the rnc
who's that woman from michigan
to head up the rnc
thank you, ronna
great job, setting all kinds of records, polling records, contribution records, everything
we're doing everything, so it's great
and tommy hicks
i want you to say hello, tom hicks, who's a special friend
and haley, thank you, darling
i retweeted you, haley
i retweeted you all over the place
and together, we're all together
we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world
it's a great thing
it's a great thing
since my election, america has gained 7 million new jobs
the unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in a half a century
the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country
you believe that one
that's pretty amazing
that's pretty amazing
the unemployment rate among african americans, hispanic americans, and asian americans has reached record lows, all-time, never been lower than what it is now
and by the way, our poll numbers with african americans, with hispanic americans, with asian americans, the other side's getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships
they re going up
african american youth unemployment, so important
it was a horrible number
a few years ago, you remember, a really terrible thing was happening
it's just reached the lowest time in the history, lowest   the best number in the history of our country
and african american poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded
wages for african american workers have increased by $2,400 per year, also a record
and you know this
for decades, the democrat party has betrayed african americans
they ve betrayed us all
they ve betrayed all of us
but we're delivering for african americans
we're delivering for asian americans and hispanic americans like nobody has ever done
we are fighting for great jobs, great schools, great health care and a truly great future for our country and for them
we are the party of equal opportunity for all americans
thank you
to support working families, we've reduced the cost of childcare, expanded paid leave, and given 40 million american families an average of $2,200 more in their pockets, thanks to the republican child tax credit
who would have thought that
we have cut more job-killing regulations than any   you know this one
so you go back four years, eight years, in one case, longer than eight years, we've cut more job-killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country, and we're not finished
and we've ended the war on american energy
they want to take our energy away
they want to take our wealth away
they want to give us wind
wind, if it blows, wonderful
if it doesn't blow, you got problems
wind
they want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them
watch your house go down in value
you ever see what happens
they build a windmill within distance of your house
you could forget about your house
you could just say, well, that was the end of that investment
you want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill
take a look
it's a graveyard for birds
they kill all the birds
lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump, that's what we're doing
we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies
washington politicians, i mean, you know this
they shattered new hampshire factories
you were one of the worst examples ever, nafta
what nafta did to your communities, i mean, to your state, is incredible, shattered your communities and sacrificed your jobs on the altar of globalism
we can forget globalism
we want to take care of our country
new hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of nafta and china's entrance into the wto, the world trade organization, one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country
for decades politicians campaigned across this state, promising to replace nafta
they lied
they never did it
they never even tried to do it
they wouldn't have been able to, anyway
it wasn't easy
i will tell you that
but then they got elected, and they did absolutely nothing
but i'm not like those other politicians
i keep my promises
we took care of it
we took care of it
last month, we ended the   you saw last month, bye-bye
i say, donald j
trump
bye-bye, nafta
we ended the nafta catastrophe, and i signed the brand-new u
s-mexico-canada agreement into law
that's going to be great for our manufacturers, our farmers, great for everybody, great for our workers
the usmca will bring jobs back to new hampshire, right where they belong
they should've never left in the first place
probably, the no
1 reason i ran for office, i'm one for one
i have friends
some of these great senators, they look at lindsey over there, look at rand, these great senators
sir, i ve run five times, and i've won three
another senator said, sir, i've won seven times, sir
southern senator, i won seven times, sir, and i've won five of those damn contests
i said, senator, i ran once, and i won just once
and we're going to run twice, and that's going to be it, although they think we're going to run much more than that
you know that
that scares the hell out of the fake news, i will tell you
they can't take a joke
i also took the strongest-ever action to confront china's massive theft of american jobs, and our strategy worked
massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions
we never took in 10 cents from china
they ripped us so much, you wouldn't believe it
now, they respect us again
last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defeat so many of our opponents
the money that's pouring in, people don't even believe it
and by the way, the virus, they're working hard
looks like by april, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away
i hope that's true
but we're doing great in our country
china, i spoke with president xi, and they're working very, very hard
and i think it's going to all work out fine
rough stuff, i tell you, rough, rough stuff
but i think it's going to work out good
we only have 11 cases, and they're all getting better
but our trade agreement with china will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and substantially boost exports of american-made goods
isn't that nice
after years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country
or no issue of washington democrats more thoroughly sold out the american people than a thing called immigration, right
before i came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, and that's what they want
i see them campaigning right down the street
it's really boring to watch, but i try and watch
i have an obligation to watch, really boring stuff, but they want open borders
they want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what we're looking for
i mean, murderers, rapists, and some other things
they're going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in new hampshire
and you have one of the biggest drug problems in the country, and we brought it down 18%
but we have to do better
18%
washington democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the well-being of american citizens
they want to let anyone into our country from all around the world, just come on in, folks
we're going to give you free health care
we're going to give you free education
we're going to give you more than our vets are getting
we're going to give you   every family will get a free rolls-royce
you know i said that, matt
i said that to them
and some of the fake news picked it up, and they said, president trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand-new free rolls-royce
he lied
he lied
he lied
they gave me a pinocchio
they don't get it, matt
do they, matt
actually, they get it better than we understand
they get it very well
they get it
they know what's happening
and the wall is being built
i will tell you, the wall is being built
and, you know, they went after us on   everybody knows the wall is going up
so what's happening, you know   you do know who's paying for the wall, don't you
right
redemption from illegal aliens that are coming in
the redemption money is paying for the wall
they re so sad to hear that because they re, ok, finally
they go, you have to understand
an entire party is fighting
they'll give me anything i want
our military rebuilt at $2
2 trillion
it's really $2
5 trillion over a period of three years
they give me anything but not 10 cents for the wall
they said, we like drones
well, drones don't keep people out
drones are wonderful
they fly around, take pictures
we're going to give you a drone
no good
so we now have built over 100 miles of wall
and when we have that wall built, you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don't come in
i say the illegal   they can't come in
they don't come in
so we are up to over 100   substantially more than 100 miles of wall, and we'll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future
and by the way, you have to see   you wouldn't believe it
you have to see what happens when that wall goes up
you have to see the numbers change like magic
they change like magic
it's called   you know, you ever hear the thing, you know, with all the modern technology, all of the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that, two things never change, right
a wheel and a wall
right
a wheel and a wall
they're going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years
they re never going to replace the wheel, and they're never going to replace the wall
and it's a high wall
illegal immigrants coming into our country illegally, very few of them are getting in right now
you know, mexico has been terrific
we have 27,000 mexican soldiers on our border, and the numbers went down 87% from this year at this time last year
and for the amount of money washington democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild the cities in america
we could rebuild our cities
but you know, i have something because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies, read the snake
the snake, did anybody   does anybody know what i'm talking about
see now, she's been standing outside for four days
no wonder
and you look good, and i'll tell you what
four days outside in the rain and snow
look at these front-row people
these are warriors
they are warriors, too, like my congressmen and senators
because we mentioned   i made minor changes
they mentioned illegal immigration
this is about immigration
this was a song from the 1950s, al green, and they mentioned i made little changes to it
that's ok
but they mentioned illegal immigration, right
and i used to do this a lot, and people couldn't get enough of it, to be honest with you
and i haven't done it for a while, and i thought i'd do it tonight because you're on the eve of giving us an opponent, and all of these people want open borders
they want open borders, and we don't want open borders
we want very strong, closed borders
and we want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit, and we want them to come in legally, right
right
through merit and legally, right
so we'll do this quickly
this is illegal immigration
it's called oh, listen to how quiet it is
listen to how quiet   now watch how quiet it gets
it gets so quiet
but this is all about   i love you, too
that was a guy that said that, but i love him, too
i love everybody
ready
so important, illegal immigration
on her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake
his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
poor thing, she cried
i'll take you in, and i'll take care of you
take me in, oh, tender woman
take me in, for heaven's sake
take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the vicious snake
she wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
she hurried home from work that night
and as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been fully, fully revived
take me in, oh, tender woman
take me in, for heaven's sake
take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed that vicious snake
she clutched him to her bosom
you're so beautiful, she cried
but if i hadn't brought you in by now, you truly would have died
she stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight, but instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite
take me in, oh, tender woman
take me in, for heaven's sake
take me in, oh, tender woman, sighed the vicious snake
i saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me
but why
you know your bite is poisonous, and now i'm going to die
shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin
you knew damn well i was a snake before you took me in
got to come in legally and through merit under my administration
we re fully taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of african american and hispanic americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities
in this region of the country alone, last year, ice officers   we love our ice officers
the democrats don't like them
the democrats don't like them
ice officers are the toughest human beings, and they love the country as much as anybody in this room
last year alone, they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape, and murder, over 2,000 accused of murder
yet left-wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the american community
one of my guests at the state of the union was american citizen jody jones
i introduced him that night
his beloved brother, rocky, was murdered by a criminal alien in california, shot him eight times at close range, wouldn't stop
rocky's killer had been previously arrested many, many times, but under california's totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law, authorities were ordered to set him free
tragically, left-wing politicians in new hampshire are trying to replicate california's disastrous policies
last year, the democrat-controlled new hampshire house, blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state
and by the way, you have a great governor, chris sununu
he's on top of it
he's on top of it
and his father's a great guy
his father didn't like me too much a few years ago
once i won, i'm telling you, he was so good
he was as good   he fought like hell for us, all of us
it's a great family
and chris is doing a fantastic job
if you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote republican in 2020 november
and thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row
illegal crossings are down now at record numbers, and we've ended catch and release
you know what catch and release is
you catch an illegal alien by law
you then take his name and address
they don't have addresses
what's your address
what
they don't have addresses
they come into the country
they don't have addresses
so you take his name, and then you have to release him into the country, and you say, we'll see you in four years for your court case
well, thank you very much, klaus
and a very special congratulations on your 50th year hosting the annual meeting of the world economic forum
a truly amazing achievement
it's an honor to address the distinguished members of this organization for the second time as president
when i spoke at this forum two years ago, i told you that we had launched the great american comeback
today, i'm proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before
we've regained our stride, we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of american enterprise
america is thriving, america is flourishing, and yes, america is winning again like never before
just last week alone, the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals
the agreement with china and the united states-mexico-canada agreement   the two biggest trade deals ever made
they just happened to get done in the same week
these agreements represent a new model of trade for the 21st century   agreements that are fair, reciprocal, and that prioritize the needs of workers and families
america's economic turnaround has been nothing short of spectacular
when i took office three years ago, america's economy was in a rather dismal state
under the previous administration, nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs had vanished, wages were flat or falling, almost 5 million more americans had left the labor force than had gotten jobs, and more than 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls
the experts predicted a decade of very, very slow growth   or even maybe negative growth   high unemployment, and a dwindling workforce, and very much a shrinking middle class
millions of hardworking, ordinary citizens felt neglected, betrayed, forgotten
they were rapidly losing faith in the system
before my presidency began, the outlook for many nations was bleak
top economists warned of a protracted worldwide recession
the world bank lowered its projections for global growth to a number that nobody wanted to even think about
pessimism had taken root deep in the minds of leading thinkers, business leaders, and policymakers
yet despite all of the cynics, i had never been more confident in america's future
i knew we were on the verge of a profound economic resurgence, if we did things right   one that would generate a historic wave of investment, wage growth, and job creation
i knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people, if we cut taxes, slashed regulations   and we did that at a level that's never been done before in the history of our country, in a short period of time   fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped american energy, that prosperity would come thundering back at a record speed
and that is exactly what we did, and that is exactly what happened
since my election, america has gained over 7 million jobs   a number unthinkable
i wouldn't say it, i wouldn't talk about it, but that was a number that i had in mind
the projection was 2 million
we did 7   more than three times the government's own projections
the unemployment rate is now less than 3, 4, and 5 percent
and at 3
5 percent, that's a number that is the lowest in more than 50 years
the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u
president in recorded history
we started off with reasonably high rate
for the first time in decades, we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few
we're concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist
we are lifting up americans of every race, color, religion, and creed
unemployment rates among african americans, hispanic americans, and asian americans have all reached record lows
african american youth unemployment has reached the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country
african american poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded
the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level since 1953
and women now comprise a majority of the american workforce
that's for the first time
the unemployment rate for veterans has dropped to a record low
the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all-time record low
workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in u
history
wages are rising across the board
and those at the bottom of the income ladder are enjoying the percentage, by far, largest gains
workers' wages are now growing faster than management wages
earnings growth for the bottom 10 percent is outpacing the top 10 percent   something that has not happened
paychecks for high school graduates are rising faster than for college graduates
young americans just entering the workforce are also sharing in america's extraordinary prosperity
since i took office, more than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent annually   a number that was unthinkable
nobody would have ever thought it was possible three years ago
a record number of americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working
in the eight years before i took office, over 300,000 working-age people left the workforce
in just three years in my administration, 3
5 million people have joined the workforce
ten million people have been lifted off welfare in less than three years
celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda
this is a blue-collar boom
since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47 percent   three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent
real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded
the american dream is back   bigger, better, and stronger than ever before
no one is benefitting more than america's middle class
we have created 1
2 million manufacturing and construction jobs   a number also unthinkable
after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations   hard to believe when you hear 60,000 factories   america has now gained, in a very short period of time, 12,000 new factories under my administration
and the number is going up rapidly
we'll be beating the 60,000 number that we lost, except these will be bigger, newer, and the latest
years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity
stock markets have soared by more than 50 percent since my election, adding more than $19 trillion to household wealth, and boosting 401(k)s, pensions, and college savings accounts for millions of hardworking families
and these great numbers are many things, and it's despite the fact that the fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly
and even now, as the united states is by far the strongest economic power in the world, it's not even close
it was going to be close, but a lot of good things happened to us, and some not-so-good things happened to certain other places
they're forced to compete, and we compete with nations that are getting negative rates   something very new   meaning, they get paid to borrow money
something that i could get used to very quickly
love that
got to pay back your loan
oh, how much am i getting
nevertheless, we still have the best numbers that we've had in so many different areas
it's a conservative approach, and we have a tremendous upside potential, when all of the trade deals and the massive deregulation starts kicking in   which will be during this year, especially toward the end of the year
those trade deals are starting to kick in already
the regulations are kicking in right now
and i see such tremendous potential for the future
we have not even started, because the numbers we're talking about are massive
the time for skepticism is over
people are flowing back into our country
companies are coming back into our country
many of you, who i know, are coming back in with your plants and your factories
thank you very much
america's newfound prosperity is undeniable, unprecedented, and unmatched anywhere in the world
america achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies, but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the american worker
every decision we make   on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education, and more   is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans
we are determined to create the highest standard of living that anyone can imagine, and right now, that's what we're doing for our workers
the highest in the world
and we're determined to ensure that the working and middle class reap the largest gains
a nation's highest duty is to its own citizens
honoring this truth is the only way to build faith and confidence in the market system
only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures
in the united states, we are building an economy that works for everyone, restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite citizens and powers nations
today, i hold up the american model as an example to the world of a working system of free enterprise that will produce the most benefits for the most people in the 21st century and beyond
a pro-worker, pro-citizen, pro-family agenda demonstrates how a nation can thrive when its communities, its companies, its government, and its people work together for the good of the whole nation
as part of this new vision, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history
we doubled the child tax credit, benefitting 40 million american families and lifting 650,000 single mothers and their 1 million children out of poverty   and out of poverty quickly
we passed the first-ever tax credit for employers who provide paid paternal leave for employees earning $72,000 less annually, and passed paid family leave for government employees as a model for the country
we made childcare much more affordable and reduced or eliminated childcare waitlists all across the nation
our childcare reforms are supporting working parents and ensuring their children have access to high-quality care and education, all of which they very much deserve
we lowered our business tax from the highest in the developed world down to one that's not only competitive, but one of the lower taxes
we created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long-term investments are now taxed at zero, and tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for a hundred years saw nothing
the 35 million americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by more than $22 billion
my administration has also made historic investments in historically black colleges and universities
i saved hcbus
we saved them
they were going out, and we saved them
we're removing roadblocks to success and rewarding businesses that invest in workers, families, and communities
we've also launched the most ambitious campaign in history to reduce job-killing regulations
for every new regulation adopted, we are removing eight old regulations, which will save an average of american households about $3,100 per year
it was going to be, for every one, we do two, but we were able to lift that to eight, and we think that's going to go quite a bit higher
we still have a way to go
today, i urge other nations to follow our example and liberate your citizens from the crushing weight of bureaucracy
with that, you have to run your own countries the way you want
we're also restoring the constitutional rule of law in america, which is essential to our economy, our liberty, and our future
and that's why we've appointed over 190 federal judges   a record   to interpret the law as written
one hundred and ninety federal judges   think of that   and two supreme court judges
as a result of our efforts, investment is pouring into our country
in the first half of 2019, the united states attracted nearly one-quarter of all foreign direct investment in the world   think of that
twenty-five percent of all foreign investment all over the world came into the united states, and that number is increasing rapidly
to every business looking for a place where they are free to invest, build, thrive, innovate, and succeed, there is no better place on earth than the united states
as a central part of our commitment to building an inclusive society, we established the national council for the american worker
we want every citizen, regardless of age or background, to have the cutting-edge skills to compete and succeed in tomorrow's workplace
this includes critical industries like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and 5g
under ivanka's leadership   who is with us today  our pledge to america's workers has become a full-blown national movement with over 400 companies committing to provide new job and training opportunities to already very close to 15 million american students and workers
fifteen million
america is making sweeping changes to place workers and their families at the center of our national agenda
perhaps the most transformative change of all is on trade reform, where we're addressing chronic problems that have been ignored, tolerated, or enabled for decades
our leaders did nothing about what happened to us on trade
before i was elected, china's predatory practices were undermining trade for everyone, but no one did anything about it, except allow it to keep getting worse and worse and worse
under my leadership, america confronted the problem head on
under our new phase one agreement   phase two is starting negotiations very shortly   china has agreed to substantially do things that they would not have done
measures to protect intellectual property
stop forced technology transfers
remove trade barriers in agricultural goods and on agricultural goods, where we were treated so badly
open its financial sector totally   that's done   and maintain a stable currency, all backed by very, very strong enforcement
our relationship with china, right now, has probably never been better
we went through a very rough patch, but it's never, ever been better
my relationship with president xi is an extraordinary one
he's for china
i'm for the u
but other than that, we love each other
additionally, china will spend an additional $200 billion over two years on american services, agriculture, and energy, and manufactured goods
so we'll be taking in an excess of $200 billion
could be closer to $300 billion when it finishes
but these achievements would not have been possible without the implementation of tariffs, which we had to use, and we're using them on others too
and that is why most of our tariffs on china will remain in place during the phase two negotiations
for the most part, the tariffs have been left, and we're being paid billions and billions of dollars a year as a country
as i mentioned earlier, we ended the nafta disaster   one of the worst trade deals ever made
not even close   and replaced it with the incredible new trade deal, the usmca   that's mexico and canada
in the nearly 25 years after nafta, the united states lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, including nearly 1 in 4 vehicle-manufacturing jobs
it was an incentive to leave the country
the nafta agreement exemplified the decades-long failures of the international trading system
the agreement shifted wealth to the hands of a few, promoted massive outsourcing, drove down wages, and shuttered plants and factories by the thousands
the plants would leave our country, make the product, sell it into our country
we ended up with no jobs and no taxes
would buy other countries' product
that doesn't happen anymore
this is the wreckage that i was elected to clean up
it's probably the reason i ran for president, more than any other thing, because i couldn't understand why we were losing all of these jobs to other countries at such a rapid rate
and it got worse and worse, and i think it's probably the primary reason that i ran, but there are other reasons also
and to replace with a new system that puts workers before the special interests
and the special interests will do just fine, but the workers come first
our brand-new usmca is the result of the broadest coalition ever assembled for a trade agreement
manufacturing, agriculture, and labor all strongly endorsed the deal
and, as you know, it just passed in congress overwhelmingly
it shows how to solve the 21st century challenge we all face
protecting intellectual property, expanding digital trade, re-shoring lost jobs, and ensuring rising wages and living standards
the united states has also concluded a great new trade deal with japan   approximately $40 billion   and completely renegotiated our deal with south korea
we're also negotiating many other transactions with many other countries
and we look forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the united kingdom
they have a wonderful new prime minister and wants very much to make a deal, as they say
to protect our security and our economy, we are also boldly embracing american energy independence
the united states is now, by far, the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far
it's not even close
while many european countries struggle with crippling energy costs, the american energy revolution is saving american families $2,500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn't happen, and also, very importantly, prices at the pump
we've been so successful that the united states no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations
with an abundance of american natural gas now available, our european allies no longer have to be vulnerable to unfriendly energy suppliers either
we urge our friends in europe to use america's vast supply and achieve true energy security
with u
companies and researchers leading the way, we are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy, including from traditional fuels, lng, clean coal, next-generation nuclear power, and gas hydrate technologies
at the same time, i'm proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth   and we're going to keep it that way
and we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it's the cleanest it's been in the last 40 years
we're committed to conserving the majesty of god's creation and the natural beauty of our world
today, i'm pleased to announce the united states will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the world economic forum
one trillion trees
and in doing so, we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring, growing, and better managing our trees and our forests
this is not a time for pessimism
this is a time for optimism
fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action
but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse
they are the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune-tellers   and i have them and you have them, and we all have them, and they want to see us do badly, but we don't let that happen
they predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the '70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s
these alarmists always demand the same thing
absolute power to dominate, transform, and control every aspect of our lives
we will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country, or eradicate our liberty
america will always be the proud, strong, and unyielding bastion of freedom
in america, we understand what the pessimists refuse to see
that a growing and vibrant market economy focused on the future lifts the human spirit and excites creativity strong enough to overcome any challenge   any challenge by far
the great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century   from penicillin, to high-yield wheat, to modern transportation, and breakthrough vaccines   have lifted living standards and saved billions of lives around the world
and we're continuing to work on things that you'll be hearing about in the near future that, even today, sitting here right now, you wouldn't believe it's possible that we have found the answers
you'll be hearing about it
but we have found answers to things that people said would not be possible   certainly not in a very short period of time
but the wonders of the last century will pale in comparison to what today's young innovators will achieve because they are doing things that nobody thought even feasible to begin
we continue to embrace technology, not to shun it
when people are free to innovate, millions will live longer, happier, healthier lives
for three years now, america has shown the world that the path to a prosperous future begins with putting workers first, choosing growth, and freeing entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life
for anyone who doubts what is possible in the future, we need only look at the towering achievements of the past
only a few hundred miles from here are some of the great cities of europe   teeming centers of commerce and culture
each of them is full of reminders of what human drive and imagination can achieve
centuries ago, at the time of the renaissance, skilled craftsmen and laborers looked upwards and built the structures that still touch the human heart
to this day, some of the greatest structures in the world have been built hundreds of years ago
in italy, the citizens once started construction on what would be a 140-year project, the duomo of florence
an incredible, incredible place
while the technology did not yet exist to complete their design, city fathers forged ahead anyway, certain that they would figure it out someday
these citizens of florence did not accept limits to their high aspirations and so the great dome was finally built
in france, another century-long project continues to hold such a grip on our hearts and our souls that, even 800 years after its construction, when the cathedral of notre dame was engulfed in flames last year   such a sad sight to watch
unbelievable site, especially for those of us that considered it one of the great, great monuments and representing so many different things   the whole world grieved
through her sanctuary now stands scorched and charred   and a sight that's hard to believe
when you got used to it, to look at it now, hard to believe
but we know that notre dame will be restored   will be restored magnificently
the great bells will once again ring out for all to hear, giving glory to god and filling millions with wonder and awe
the cathedrals of europe teach us to pursue big dreams, daring adventures, and unbridled ambitions
they urge us to consider not only what we build today, but what we will endure long after we are gone
they testify to the power of ordinary people to realize extraordinary achievements when united by a grand and noble purpose
so, together, we must go forward with confidence, determination, and vision
we must not be timid, or meek, or fearful   but instead we must boldly seize the day and embrace the moment
we have so many great leaders in this room   not only business leaders, but leaders of nations   and some are doing such a fantastic job
we work together very closely
we will draw strength from the glories of the past, and we will make greatness our common mission for the future
together, we will make our nations stronger, our countries safer, our culture richer, our people freer, and the world more beautiful than ever before
above all else, we will forever be loyal to our workers, our citizens, and our families   the men and women who are the backbone of our economies, the heart of our communities, and the soul of our countries
let us bring light to their lives one by one and empower them to light up the world
thank you very much
god bless you
god bless your countries
and god bless america
thank you
thank you very much
well, i want to thank you very much
and thank you to our great secretary of agriculture, sonny perdue
thank you, sonny, very much
you've done a fantastic job
sit down, everybody
let's stay for a while
come on
we did it
we did it
remember
they were all saying, you'll never get nafta changed
we were stuck with one of the worst trade deals in history
we'll never do it
we'll never get a deal done with china
i've told everybody, you got to buy a lot of land, and you've got to get much bigger tractors right now
because we did a great deal with china   great for our country
and hopefully, it's great for china, too, because we're going to sell them the greatest product you've ever seen, right
the greatest product you've ever seen
but i am thrilled to be back in this incredible state of texas
we've had a tremendous victory
and from what i understand, those polls are all saying we're way higher than we were in '16
is that correct
that's right, dan
thank you, lieutenant governor
my dan
great
thank you very much
we're doing good
but this is where the people are known for being tough, and strong, and hardworking, loyal, fiercely patriotic   just like america's incredible farmers
my administration is fighting for the american farmer, and has been fighting for the farmer and the rancher every single day
and together, we've achieved something truly stunning
and, really, it was a historic number of victories   not one
we had numerous victories
a lot of them just   it sort of all came together
what good timing
i said, let's see if we can get it done for this event
most presidents don't come
and when they do, they come once
this is my third time in a row, and i promise i'll be here next year, too
we'll be here next year
in fact, a poll just came out   wall street journal
it just came out
look at this
farmer approval of trump hits record, poll shows… 83 percent of the farmers and ranchers approve of the president's job performance
83 percent
but, i want to know, really
who are the 17 percent
who are they
who the hell are the 17 percent
anybody in here from the 17 percent
don't raise your hand
it may be dangerous
that's pretty good, right
but, on wednesday, after two years of hard-fought negotiations, where the farmers and ranchers stood with me all the way   they knew we had to do it
it wasn't done by other administrations
they didn't want to do it because it was nasty
we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china
under this landmark agreement, china will now be purchasing $40- to $50 billion of american agricultural products every single year, tripling our agricultural exports to china
you know, we had a deal
it was done at $20   $20 billion   the most they ever purchased, according to sonny perdue
i said, sonny, we have to help the farmer because they were targeted
and i'm not saying i blame china
you know, they want to win
we want to win
we all want to win, right
we like to win
how is your team doing today, by the way
i don't know
how is it going
are they doing okay
we'll soon find out
i said, this is wonderful thing
i come to… look at this place
it's packed
it's sold out
look at the crowd
it's sold out
and you have a   you have a game with the team, known as texas
but we'll see how it does
let's   this is right now
this is the thing we have to focus on
but, on thursday of this week, we made a really historic   once again, the senate passed   because this is in addition to china   the u
-mexico-canada agreement to replace the catastrophe, the disaster known as nafta
i've been complaining about it for many years
our jobs left
our factories closed
our companies left, opened up
they made product
they sold it into the united states   no tax, no nothing
we have just the opposite right now
it's very painful if they want to do that
it's very hard for them to do that, economically
the usmca, as we call it, will massively boost exports for farmers, ranchers, growers, and agricultural producers from north to south, and from sea to shining sea
it also has tremendous impacts on manufacturers and all of the other things   good for everybody
but we won't bother
we only care about the farmers today, and the ranchers
right
so we don't have to talk about the manufacturers
but it's fantastic for manufacturing and lots of other things
and our manufacturing numbers are fantastic
you see that
remember
manufacturing
phil, you remember
there's no more manufacturing
and then we have almost 600,000 jobs
they said, the last administration, you'd need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing
so i guess we found the magic wand
we found the magic wand
joining us today are a few of your strongest allies in washington who helped make these achievements possible
senators pat roberts and cindy hyde-smith   where are they
please
please
pat and cindy hyde
i'll tell you
these are two people that love the farmer
and pat   i mean, every time i get a call   pat
that meant like, come on
come on, president
let's go, president
but what a great career you've had
what an unbelievable number of election victories you've had
we'd love to keep you for a long time, but i don't think we can talk about him out of it at this point
but, pat, thank you very much
and cindy hyde-smith, you have a done a fantastic job representing everybody, but representing the farmers and ranchers
thank you very much
and, pat, thank you very much
great job
and representatives randy weber, roger williams, and john carter
please stand up
warriors   they're warriors
and also, three friends of mine   texas leaders at the highest level   lieutenant governor dan patrick, attorney general ken paxton, and agriculture commissioner sid miller
please stand up
please stand up
that's great
hi, sid
i remember 2016   the election
and the fake news   these people back here     they were going   they were saying, trump   going to have a hard time winning texas
and we came
we made speeches, sid
remember
we'd have 25-, 30,000 people standing on line
can't get in
and i said, why am i going to have a hard time with texas
and i remember, sid miller   i didn't know sid
but he was big, and he had the big, beautiful cowboy hat on
i love that hat
i wish we could wear them in washington or new york because i would be the biggest buyer of that hat
i just don't know if it would play there, but i'll wear them in texas, i'll tell you
but sid was sitting there with that hat on, and he looked great
and he said, i don't know about you, and i don't know where you're getting this information about a close race in texas, but there's going to be nothing close about this race in texas
trump is going to win this race by so much, you're not going to believe it
that's exactly what happened
so, thank you very much
i didn't know sid
he just said, trump is going to win by a lot
and ever since then, i've liked sid a lot, and you turned out to be right
right, sid
thank you very much
great job
great job
i also want to take a moment to send our love and support to the president of the american farm bureau   a great guy   zippy duvall
sadly, zippy's wonderful wife   a tremendous woman, married for 40 years   bonnie   passed away last night
and we want zippy and his entire family to know we are keeping them in our thoughts and prayers
and he was a very   it was a very special relationship, and i just want to wish the family well
and, zippy, we're with you 100 percent   100 percent
thank you very much
so, i'm truly honored to be addressing the farm bureau's annual convention for my third straight year
my administration understands that if we want to stand up for america, we must stand up for american farmers
so important
incredible people
if we want america to thrive and grow, then we must ensure that america's farms flourish and prosper
and that's what we're doing
you feed our people, you fuel our nation, you sustain our land, you uphold our values, and you preserve our cherished american way of life
we want our products made, grown, and raised right here in the usa   and that's what's happening
i hope you all remember that, before i took office, american agriculture was being crushed by an onslaught of massive taxes
crippling regulations
burdensome federal mandates   you know about that
i released it
i released it all
and horrendous trade deals
and they were horrendous indeed
i actually used to say, who the hell would have negotiated a deal like this
when i ran for president, i vowed to use every power at my disposal to protect american farmers and restore the full strength of american agriculture
i promised that i would always have your back
and unlike the politicians who came before me   they talked a lot
they did nothing for you   i kept my promise
under the previous administration, net farm income plummeted by more than 20 percent
under my administration   and, remember, these trade deals haven't even really kicked in yet
i told china, a couple of months ago, do me a favor
we're going to make a deal
start buying
start buying
and they did
not as much as i wanted, but they did
they wanted to wait until they got the signed agreement
now we have the signed agreement
but they started buying
but it's also japan
it's also other countries
but net farm income has gone up by more than $30 billion dollars –- an increase of nearly 50 percent in just three years
remember that
and the big stuff is yet to come
the big numbers, in my opinion, are yet to come
we are fixing problems and cleaning up messes that others have neglected for decades
they've treated you very unfairly
they've treated you very foolishly
frankly, they've treated you stupidly   stupidly   to put our great farmers in this position
we are winning for our farmers, and we winning like never before
and don't forget
when i ran, i said, we're going to do this stuff
we're going to do it
but it was just words
we're going to do it
everybody said, we're going to do things
but i did it
we got it done
and this is the time
i couldn't say it last year
last year, i said, hey… you know, you were being targeted by china, in all fairness
you were being targeted
they stopped buying, purposely
then i put the big tariffs on
then i gave you a lot of the money, out of the tariffs
we had a lot of money left over, but we gave you   sonny told you   $16 billion, and $12 billion the year before
and that made you do very well
but, you know, the farmers came to me
they said, we don't want anything
we just want a level playing field
and you have now even more than a level playing field
the deal with china will tear down market barriers and pry open vast new markets for american beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, infant formula, animal feed, biotechnology, and much, much more
this is an incredible success for our entire country, and it was your fortitude, your perseverance, and your devotion that made it all possible
and i have to tell you, another benefit, and a very big benefit, is we now perhaps have the best relationship that we've had with china in many, many years
and china respects us now
they didn't respect us
they couldn't believe they were getting away with what they were getting away with
having a good relationship with china is good   and russia, is good
and many other countries, is a good thing
but we don't people taking advantage of us
for years, china stole trade secrets from american agri-businesses, and plundered our intellectual property, illicitly subsidized grain procedures, and installed one barrier after another to block out our farmers and to block out our ranchers
when my administration confronted these abusive and destructive trade practices, china targeted american agriculture for retaliation
they even took ads, saying what a bad person i was
but the farmers   only some of them believe that
and those people have come all the way back, too
to defend our farmers, i authorized $28 billion dollars
and we're getting that money, sonny, to the small farmers also
there were some statements   big farmers   no, we get them to the small farmers
we get them to everybody   big farmers, small farmers
and we have a formula that i think has been working out, sonny, very well
if it's not, call me directly, and i'll call sonny and give him hell, okay
but we're getting it to the small farmers, the big farmers, and everybody
and that's a lot of money
and i am delighted to report that the final installment of all of those billions of dollars of that money will be coming very quickly, sonny, i guess
is that a correct statement
yes
thanks
you never backed down
unless you don't want it, because you're making so much money now
if anybody would like to give it up, please raise your hand
you stayed in the fight
you protected our economy and our security
and, together, we all together   we prevailed
you were always with me
you never even thought of giving up
and we got it done
and there were times when, you know, the   the media was trying to cause trouble
they'd come into iowa
isn't it terrible with the practices and the trade
and the farmers would say, no, the president is doing the right thing
it's tough, but the president is doing the right thing
but then we started doing the big tariffs   taking in literally tens of billions of dollars
and we started giving money back
i went to sonny perdue
i said, sonny, what did china   what was the number that china did last year
he said, sir, they bought $16 billion
i said, oh, that's good
what did they do the year before
sir, they bought $12 billion worth of product
i said, good
so it's $12 billion
we gave you the $12 billion
then, $16 billion
we gave you the $16 billion so you weren't hurt
and now we have a position that i don't think the farmers and ranchers have been in this position maybe ever
i don't think so
and i think it's going to work out good
and i think china is going to go all out to prove that the agreement that was signed is a good agreement
and we have very, very strong stipulations in there
but that it's a   an agreement that is a fair agreement and good for the farmer
i think they're looking to prove that it's going to be great for the farmer
but even bigger and better than we ever thought possible   that's what this agreement is
it's much bigger and much better than i ever thought we'd get
and, frankly, there were times when i didn't think we were going to get anything because i cancelled every meeting   how many times have you seen me cancel with the iran deal
you didn't see kerry cancel ever
he just took one bad point after another bad point, and then he signed a bad agreement, and then we terminated that deal
but that's a little different than the farmer stuff
but you didn't any walking
we walked from this deal a lot
and sometimes, you have to walk from a deal in order to make the right deal
and we walked from this one a lot, didn't we
phil was talking to me, and our great past governor
it's sad to say that, but you have a great new governor
right, phil
but we were talking about it, and he says, you got to do what you got to do
if you can't make the right deal, you got to walk
it's true
so we walked a lot
and we always got called back
let's do it the way you want
on behalf of every american worker and family, thank you for standing strong for america
thank you very much to the farmers and ranchers for standing with me
for saying, the president is right
yes, it's tough right now, but the president is doing the right thing
thank you
more than anything else, it proved to me that farmers love america
and i just want to tell you that america loves our farmers
thank you
under the deal, china has agreed to spend many billions of dollars on american services, energy, and manufactured goods
china has made substantial commitments regarding the protection of american ideas, trade secrets, patents, and trademarks
china has also pledged firm action to confront pirated and counterfeit goods
most important of all, the deal is enforceable   very, very powerfully enforceable
in fact, it was probably the thing that we negotiated the most
and rest assured, we will vigorously enforce its terms
hopefully, we won't have to
hopefully, it'll go just as we anticipate
in a matter of days, we will achieve another tremendous victory for the american agricultural businesses, when i sign the usmca into law
so, we just passed it in the senate, and it was a wonderful vote, and i sign it very soon
it's being prepared now   beautifully prepared
i'm going to europe to talk to world leaders and to talk to business people about coming
everybody wants to come back to america
everybody wants to come back to the united states
we're now where the action is
they're all coming back
and when i come back, we'll have a ceremony, probably in the white house
we also may go to some of the farming communities and we're going to sign the deal
under the usmca, canada will finally provide greater access for american dairy
you know, canada was charging us 287 percent tariffs
nobody knew that
nobody knew that
i knew it
so, you basically couldn't even deal with canada
but those days are gone
our dairy exports are set to increase by more than $300 million dollars per year
poultry exports to canada could jump by nearly 50 percent
exports of eggs to both canada and mexico could skyrocket by as much as 500 percent, and maybe even 1,000 percent
very importantly, canada will finally give fair treatment to american-grown wheat, which is a big deal to you people
what the hell do i know about it
i don't know anything about it
i just know you had a problem with it
i said to a couple of the farmers   i'd have a lot of farmers at the white house
they were incredible
i said, what's the big thing
wheat, sir
tell me about it
and they told me about it
i'm a very quick study
i figured it out quickly
i said, i know nothing about it, but that sounds right to me
so we got it in the contract
the two momentous trade deals we completed last week are just the beginning of a really incredible story
because nobody thought we'd ever get here
they'd say the deal with china would be impossible to make, and getting rid of nafta would be totally impossible
one of the reasons it was totally possible
it was such a bad deal for us   good for the other countries
not good for us
we're achieving what no administration has ever achieved before
and what do i get out it
tell me
i get impeached
that's what i get out of it
by these radical left lunatics, i get impeached
but that's okay, the farmers are sticking with trump
they're sticking with trump
these people
these people
it could have been so much easier
in just      thank you very much
in just the past few months, we persuaded japan to slash tariffs on $7 billion of u
agricultural products
over 90 percent of our agricultural exports to japan will now receive preferential treatment
nobody thought that was possible
and, in many cases, we will be completely duty free   and you've never heard that before
that's a $40 billion deal, by the way
that's in addition to china, and canada, and mexico, and south korea
we secured guaranteed access for american beef to the eu   european union   a deal that will nearly triple our beef exports to europe in the coming years
and, as you know, europe has had tremendous barriers to us doing business with them
all those barriers are coming down
they have to come down
if they don't come down, we're going to have to do things that are very bad for them
no, we've been taken advantage of by everybody
there's nobody that   we   we've been taken advantage of by everybody
europe
who would think europe
europe was, in many ways, more difficult   and is more difficult   than china
nobody would believe that
i was saying to sonny and some of the people before, dealing with europe, in many ways, has been worse and tougher than dealing with china
not fair
we have secured record market access for u
rice in south korea
it was a big one
we won tariff exemptions in ecuador for wheat and soybeans
they were tariffing us out of business
we opened up vietnam for american orange growers
we got brazil to raise its quotas for purchases of our wheat and ethanol
we opened up guatemala and tunisia to american eggs
and in november, we ended china's years-long ban on american poultry
you know that very well   years-long
and part of it was
i asked
i said, you got to do this
they said, but nobody has ever asked before
i said, but i'm asking
thank you very much
nobody ever asked
half of it, nobody asked
if we harvest or herd it in the united states, i want to help you sell it all around the world
to make american agriculture even more competitive, we passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in american history, by far
and to help you keep your family farm, and keep it in the family, we virtually eliminated the deeply unfair estate tax, or death tax
we got rid of it for small farms, ranchers, and small businesses
so, if you love your children, you can now leave your farms and your ranches and your small businesses to your children, and you don't have to pay tax
if you love your children, you don't have to pay the estate tax or the death tax
if you do not love your children, you don't really care about that provision
is there anybody here that does not love their children and does not want to leave their beautiful farm to their children
anybody here
come on, you have guts
i think farmers have a lot of guts
come on
you mean there's not one person that dislikes your children because they're brats   because they're spoiled rotten brats
okay, well, that's a pretty good group of people
well, that's the farmers for you, right
that's the farmers
but think of that
you know, people were wanting to pass along their farm
and they'd pass away, and their children would take it
and then the tax people would come along, and the tax would be monumental
and the income wouldn't be so good, but the value of the farm was a lot
and they'd go out and they'd mortgage the farm to the hilt
and within a short period of time, the banks are foreclosing on the farm, and taking the farm, and putting the farm up for sale
you don't have to worry about that anymore
there's no more estate tax
there's no more death tax on those farms
so, good
that's good
that's really good
that's very important
that was a hard thing to get
that was hard to get by the wonderful democrats that we have to deal with every day
thanks to our pro-american tax cuts, trade reforms, and regulatory reductions, america now has the hottest economy anywhere on earth, and there's no place even close
everybody is coming back
since my election, the united states has gained more than 7 million jobs   un-thought of
if i would have said that on the campaign trail, the fake news would have gone crazy
the unemployment rate is now 3
5 percent   the lowest in over 51 years, half a century
the african american, hispanic american, and asian american unemployment rates have reached the all-time historic lows   lowest in the history of our country
more americans are working today than ever before   almost 160 million
never even been close to that
under the so-called trump economy, the lowest-paid earners are reaping the biggest, fastest, and largest percentage gains
this is a blue-collar boom
everybody is booming, frankly, but it's a blue-collar boom
net worth for the bottom 50 percent of wage earners has grown 15 times more under my administration
think of that
15 times
you know, 15 times more than under the three prior administrations
wages for the bottom 10 percent are rising faster than for the top 10 percent
and that's okay for the rich people
let somebody else enjoy life a little bit, right
does any rich person   of which we probably have a lot in this room   any rich person have a problem with that
please stand up
i don't think we're going to see that person standing
real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded
think of that
highest ever recorded
you know, in the bush administration, for eight years
$450
in the obama administration, for eight years
$975
in the trump administration, for less than three years
almost $10,000, when you include the tax cuts, the energy savings, and the regulation cuts
nobody can believe it
nobody can believe it
think of that   isn't that amazing
$450, $975
and that's been in eight years, eight years
and then you have less than three years   because it was done as of a few months ago   and you have almost $10,000
to power our future, america is boldly embracing energy independence
the united states is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, which means lower prices for farmers and consumers
and you see how the prices are
they're stable to low
and it means america is no longer reliant on foreign nations
isn't that nice
and we are also proudly promoting american ethanol
chuck grassley calls me
joni ernst calls me
deb fischer calls me
they all call   everybody
pat calls me
ethanol
they love ethanol
and i recently approved e-15 to be used all year round, instead of eight months
and that's a big thing for the american farmer
we're providing unprecedented support to ethanol   support like they've never had before
yet, the radical left in washington wants to demolish these gains
and they, frankly, want to destroy your way of life
they are not for the farmer
they are not for our military
they are not for secure borders
they want open borders
they want sanctuary cities
essentially, what they're saying is, we want crime
and they don't want crime, but that's what you get when you have open borders
and, by the way, just so you know, the wall is being built at a very rapid pace
we're over 100 miles now
we think we'll be over 400 miles by the end of next year
and shortly thereafter, we'll have a completed wall
and you probably also   this was a big news story
they saw people   they had to capture them
they couldn't get over the wall
they had to send trucks and ladders and firepeople because they got stuck on the top of the wall
they couldn't get down
loaded up with drugs on their back
so it's very successful
it's going to be very, very successful
it's having a big impact already because we're setting records now   what we're doing, in terms of people coming into our country illegally
we want them to come into our country, by the way
we want them to come in, though, through merit
we want them to come in legally
and we want them to come so they can help the farmer, just so you understand
because i want them to be able to come in to help our farmers
and we're going to give you plenty of help
because without that, it's very difficult
taking their cues from socialists like bernie sanders, or a fake socialist like pocahontas
she's actually worse than a socialist, but she doesn't want to admit it
but the far left, they want to massively raise your taxes, crush your   your businesses with regulations, take away your healthcare, and send bureaucrats to interfere with your property and second guess every decision that you make
well, thank you very much
a couple of things happened today that are very exciting
the usmca passed the senate
it's one of the biggest trade bills ever made
and then, yesterday, as you know, china passed, and that's something that is extraordinary
and it's going to have tremendous far-reaching effects, including our relationship, long term, with china, our farmers and manufacturers and bankers, and everybody
it's jobs
it's jobs like we've never seen before, and that's going to be something very special
and usmca today, which just passed by a very comfortable vote   a very high vote   we are very proud to have that
so we've done two of the biggest trade deals
they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done
and we're honored to have done them in a short period of time
we are gathered in the oval office for the national religious freedom day   something very important and very special, and special to me and the people that are gathered around me
this afternoon, we're proudly announcing historic steps to protect the first amendment right to pray in public schools
so you have the right to pray
and that's a very important and powerful right
there's nothing more important than that, i would say
we're joined by the secretary of education, betsy devos
deputy attorney general jeffrey rosen
and students and advocates from across america
and advocates they were
they've been calling and writing by the thousands
and you're representing that large group of people
in a sacred principle of our republic that government must never stand between the people and god
yet, in public schools around the country, authorities are stopping students and teachers from praying, sharing their faith, or following their religious beliefs
it is totally unacceptable
you see it on the football field
you see it so many times where they're stopped from praying
and we are doing something to stop that
tragically, there is a growing totalitarian impulse on the far-left that seeks to punish, restrict, and even prohibit religious expression
something that, if you go back 10 years or 15 years or 20 years, it was un-thought of that a thing like that could even happen   that anybody would even think of something like that happening
that is why, today, my administration is issuing strong new guidance to protect religious liberty in our public schools
the right of students and teachers to freely exercise their faith will always be protected, including the right to pray
so we call this the right to pray
is that a good idea
good
right
you like that, right
nine federal agencies are also proposing new rules to roll back discriminatory regulations
so we have rules to roll back discriminatory regulations on religious service organizations
and earlier this afternoon, my white house released a new memo to make sure federal funding is never used to violate the first amendment   which is a very big deal
with us today is hannah allen, a high school freshman from texas
hannah, would you tell us what happened at your school with respect to you and prayer
hannah
thank you, darling
right here
well
so what ultimately happened
how was that resolved
and now you're able to do that
good
well, now it's going to be much easier yet
okay
all right
thank you, darling
that was beautiful
thank you very much
we're also joined by marilyn rhames, a former teacher and the founder of teachers who pray
marilyn, if you could, let us know   where is
good
thank you very much
maybe you give us a little bit about what happened
that was really beautifully said
thank you very much
that was beautiful
thanks, marilyn
so, while i'm president, which will be hopefully for five years   and, i don't know, maybe we'll work on, with the media, we'll work on a major extension of that
right
but we will not let anyone push god from the public square
we will uphold religious liberty for all
and i want to thank you all, and god bless you all for being here
it's a great time in our country
we're doing things that nobody thought was possible
i'd like to ask, if i might, secretary devos and deputy attorney general rosen to say a few words about our actions, if you don't mind
please
go ahead, betsy
please
thank you very much
beautiful
thank you, betsy, very much
jeff
right
thank you, jeff
good job
very good job
thank you very much, jeff
paula, would you like to say something
go ahead
thank you very much, paula
that's great
thank you very much
would anybody like to say anything
go ahead
yes, go ahead
go ahead
wow
well, it's not going to be happening anymore
okay
all right
that's a beautiful   it's a beautiful story
well told, because it sets such a good plate out there for people
i mean, you hear a story like that, it's such a shocking   jeff, that's a shocking story, right
you were the only catholic in the school
but they didn't have any idea
it was just   and the teacher did not treat you properly, right
okay
we're changing that
okay
great job
that was beautiful
come here
give me that hand
anybody over here
anybody
sure
good
that's right
that's right
beautiful
thank you very much
that's very nice
thank you very much
please
we greatly appreciate your joining us at this white house event
this is a very important and remarkable occasion
today, we take a momentous step   one that has never been taken before with china   toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade, as we sign phase one of the historic trade deal between the united states and china
together, we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for american workers, farmers, and families
i want to thank president xi, who is watching as we speak   and i'll be going over to china in the not-too-distant future to reciprocate   but i want to thank president xi, a very, very good friend of mine
we've   we're representing different countries
he's representing china
i'm representing the u
but we've developed an incredible relationship
but i want to thank him for his cooperation and partnership throughout this very complex process
our negotiations were tough, honest, open, and respectful   leading us to this really incredible breakthrough
most people thought this could never happen
it should have happened 25 years ago, by the way
but that's okay
a man who also has become a good friend of mine and somebody who's very, very talented and very capable, we're delighted to be joined by vice premier liu he, ambassador tiankai, and many other representatives from the people's republic of china
we are especially proud of the efforts of vice president mike pence, who is with us
and, mike, i'd like to have you say a few words, please
thank you, mike
an incredible job
incredible guy
i also want to give special thanks to our u
trade representative, who's been kept very busy
he's doing a lot of deals
we'll have another big one next week
it should get approved very shortly, and that'll be tremendous, with canada and mexico
but we'll talk about that next week
but robert lighthizer   are we keeping you busy enough
huh
poor guy can't sleep
he tosses and turns
what happened to him
oh, okay
thanks
mike
mike
mike said   that's right, you are all-purpose, come to think
but bob lighthizer is really an outstanding guy
he gets along with people
he's smart, he's sharp
and he understands trade better than anybody
when i first took this, i said, i got to get the best guy
and all signs pointed to robert lighthizer
so thank you very much, bob
thank you very much
i have one question
was this an easier job or a tougher job than you thought
i had a feeling you might say that
also, our great treasury secretary, steven mnuchin, has worked with bob hand in hand
and thank you very much, steve
great job
so this really is a landmark agreement
but along with them, we had the exceptional efforts of jared kushner
where is jared
where is jared
our brilliant jared
great job, jared
he worked hard
he left a beautiful, nice, very prosperous real estate business, and came here
and, i can tell you, that was harder
this is harder than real estate in new york, isn't it, jared
right
but you've done a fantastic job
you don't get people like that
so thank you very much
and, ivanka, nice to have you here
thank you, honey
also somebody that i've heard for 35 years
his voice is just   a great gentleman, a friend of mine, but a great gentleman
we brought him in and he has been outstanding
the only problem is he doesn't like going on television very much
he's a little bit shy about that
larry kudlow
where's larry
where is larry
we had a day where the market went down $1 trillion
think of that
in other words, it was one of those few days, because we've had 141 days where we hit all-time highs
and we just broke   as you know, we just broke the 29,000 mark on the dow, just now, as we were walking in
the market is up substantially today
we have all these business leaders
i'm sure they don't care
but larry kudlow went out into the beautiful lawns of the white house
actually, he was standing in the middle of the rose garden
he had a beautiful scarf waving in the wind
he was everything perfect, right out of greenwich, connecticut
and he started talking
and by the time he finished, i said, you just made a trillion dollars
a trillion
because the market went up like 250 points
i said, larry, what the hell did you say
and it didn't matter
but we were even
we went from being a trillion down to even, and that was pretty good
larry, you've been fantastic
thank you very much
appreciate it
and, by the way, i just see in the audience our great ambassador to china, right
governor
so we had the governor of iowa, and he loves china
and he's the long-   you're the longest-serving governor in the history of our country
like 24 years
and i called him
i said, governor, you have to do me a favor
because i remember one conversation i had with him
i was going in to make a speech, before the election, and he said, sir, please don't say anything bad about china
it's the first time anyone ever said that to me
and i said, who is this guy
he's the governor of iowa
he just said, don't say bad about china
so i had to rip up about half of my speech, right
and i said, why
and he said, well, we do a lot of business
i've been dealing with china for 35 years, with corn and all of the different things
and he told me a story that was amazing
he said, you know, 35 years ago, when i started, i met a man named xi
he wasn't president then
he was a young man
and the governor came back
he told his wife, he said   this is 35 years ago
and it's documented
he said, i just met the future president of china
and nobody thought much about it
and you know what
twenty-eight years later, you turned out to be right
and you have been an incredible ambassador
and they like each other so much
so when it came time to picking the important position of ambassador, i said, haven't you had enough after 24 years being governor of iowa
he said, if you want me to do that
and it's been a great   you've been a great help
thank you very much, ambassador
i appreciate it
done a great job
nobody could have done that job better
a man   i think i can go on the opposite side of the spectrum, perhaps, from the governor
his attitude is a little different
our trade advisor, peter navarro
right, peter
he's a little different
we have all types
we have all types
a deputy chief of staff, chris liddell, who's been with us for a long time, and he's done a fantastic job and had a great business career
commerce secretary   a legend on wall street   wilbur ross
where's wilbur
thank you
wilbur, thank you
a man who knows agriculture as well as anybody in the world
we were looking for an agricultural person, and we wanted to go political, and we were looking for somebody that would fit perfectly
and sonny came in, and it was over
i learned more in that half hour about agriculture than i   joni, right
than i could ever have learned, possibly
sonny perdue has been incredible
and we're taking care of our farmers   that, i can tell you
so, sonny, thank you very much
great job
thank you
thank you, sonny
and a woman   transportation is going very well
she's done an incredible job
we're getting approvals down now from 20 years   21 years to 2 years
and it may get rejected for environmental or other reasons
but we have it, lindsey, down to about two years
a highway which would have taken 19 to 20 years to get approval, we have it down to 2
and we want to get it down to one
and if it doesn't work, we're going to say, you don't build it
but you're not going to wait 22 years to find out you can't build the highway
and she has been fantastic
secretary of transportation elaine chao
thank you, elaine
thank you, elaine
so we have tremendous numbers of people here, and i'm saying, do i introduce them
but i think i sort of should because what the hell
this is a big celebration
and, by the way, some of the congressmen may have a vote, and i don't   it's on the impeachment hoax
so, if you want, you go out and vote
i'd rather have    it's not going to matter, because it's gone very well
but i'd rather have you voting than sitting here, listening to me introduce you, okay
they have a hoax going on over there
let's take care of it
so, if any of you guys want to leave, we will not be   where is kevin mccarthy
the great kevin mccarthy
okay, good
i'm glad
can i be honest
i'm glad
i like it much better that way
and, by   the house folks, 195 to nothing
and we got three democrats, and one of them actually left the democratic party, came over republican
and what a job you've done
so i just want to thank you all
really tough
i love that
so we have some incredible people in the audience, and i'd just like to introduce a few   a very good friend of mine   two very good friends of mine
sheldon adelson, miriam adelson
thank you very much, both, for coming
they've been tremendous supporters of us     and the republican party
and they're great people
a man who always liked me   because he's smart, so smart     the great lou dobbs
you know, at first, he said, he's the best since reagan
then, he got to know me more and more, and he said, he's even better than reagan
then, a few weeks ago, somebody told me   and i watch all the time, but somebody has got a very important show, actually
tremendous audience and very   everybody in this room watches
but lou dobbs, he said, he's the greatest of them all
i said, does that include washington and lincoln
and he said yes
now, i don't know if he was for real, but that's okay
but the great   he is   the great lou dobbs
thank you very much, lou
thank you
great show, lou
and a man who everybody knows   he knows more than probably everybody in this room put together
he's seen it all
and he made a statement to jared
jared came in and said, you know, henry kissinger told me, 'how did the president ever pull this off
' i said, can i quote henry on that
because henry is outstanding
and when henry is impressed with something, then i'm impressed
and, henry, we're impressed with you
thank you very much for being here
thank you, henry
thank you
and, michael pillsbury, thank you very much
and, susan pillsbury, thank you very much
and you've been saying some fantastic things about china and about us
and we have a good partnership
this is going to be something that's going to be very special
we're going to talk about it in a second
a friend of mine, steve schwarzman, is here
steve, i know you have no interest in this deal at all
i'm surprised you're not actually sitting over here on the ledge of the stage as opposed to   but steve has done a great job and very good relationship with china and very good relationship with us
nelson peltz is here, a friend of mine
where's nelson
nelson is around here someplace
hi, nelson
what are you doing sitting all the way back there, nelson
how's general electric doing, nels
he'll straighten it out
you'll straighten it out
he came in nice and late
he didn't get in too early, that's for sure
hank greenberg is here
hank
if they took care of hank, they wouldn't have had the problems that they had
where's hank
hank greenberg
oh, hank
if hank stayed there like he should have, you wouldn't have had the problem that you ended up having with our economy
but it's great to have you, hank
thank you very much
we have some tremendous senators here and some really incredible people
and i want to just say, the ones that are here, if i miss your name, stand up and i will promise to say it, because a lot of people wanted to be here
a senator who has been new to the game, and he took it up so quickly and so easily, and he ran a race that was undoable
the person he ran against was unbeatable
nice woman, heidi, but unbeatable
and then kevin cramer said, i can beat her
and i think he only won by about 12 points, right
and they say he's the only man in north dakota that can win
and i said, we'll do it
and i had him in my office three times and i said, kevin, you got to do it
and i said, he's doing it
and he turned me down
then he came back again   well, this time, i know he's doing it
he calls me back and he said, sir, i'm not going to do it
he said, you know, in all fairness, i'll call you back
but i never give up, do i
so now, instead of being a congressman, he's a senator
and you've been great
and thank you very much
kevin cramer
mike crapo, a friend of mine
these are all warriors
these are   incredible
mike   thank you very much, mike
what a job you do
mike is one of those guys   goes unsung, but behind the scenes, there's nobody sharper, smarter, and we all respect you and love you
every one of these people
thank you very much, mike
appreciate it
steve daines
same thing i can say for my steve
and he's got a hell of a football team
how did they do this year
all right
they going to be back
they won it again
they have a good team
they have a good team
joni ernst
you got ethanol, so you can't be complaining, right
steve      steve, that's good for you too
you know, joni would call me, along with chuck grassley
they'd call as a tandem
you can't beat the two of them
all they want to know about is ethanol
ethanol
but we got it done
deb fischer   same boat, right, deb
you want that ethanol for nebraska
and a friend of mine, lindsey graham
he's become a great friend of mine and he's an outstanding man
he loves our country
he really does love our country
he works like hell
do you do anything other than politics
he's likes golf, too
he likes golf too
much better golfer than people would understand
he likes golf
but he's a great guy
you get it done
he brings people together
chuck grassley
where's chuck
where's chuck
chuck
will you stand up for a second
this guy is the toughest guy
he can say something in a nice manner and everybody is afraid
right
he made comey choke during the hearing
he said, did you leak anything to the press
what
what
what
what
comey choked like a dog, and he was being nice when he said it
chuck is outstanding
unbeatable   between you and the governor, those are two pretty good ones, right
unbeatable under any circumstance
he makes the rounds like virtually every night
i think you still have never missed a vote
have you ever missed a vote
he was   chuck was   huh
ninety-three
he was in my office a month ago, and i thought it was very rude
he said, sir, i'm sorry, i have to leave
why
that was right in the middle of a meeting
i said, why
he said, because i have to vote and i've never missed a vote or some-   i said, how many years
he said, 1993
that's a long time
i said, you know what
go leave
that's a good record to keep
because he's a solid, reliable, unbelievable person, and he's a friend of mine
so thank you very much, chuck
and let them know also about that ethanol, chuck
we brought home the ethanol
man, when you have those two calling   they were not nice about it, jerry moran
i want to tell you   where's jerry
jerry, they were not nice about the ethanol
i want to say that
and jerry, with what he did with   we're working together   very closely together with the vets
and it's incredible what's happened with what we approved on choice
it's made a whole big difference
you don't hear complaints about the va anymore
do you notice
they go out, see a doctor
if they have to wait two months, or if they have to wait two days, they go out and see a doctor
jerry moran, folks
he did a fantastic job
rob portman, great friend of ours from ohio
rob, fantastic job
i just left ohio
they love you
they love you there, and you've done a fantastic job
and you are my friend
rob portman
thanks, rob
pat roberts
a man from kansas, who is going to be leaving us
i cannot believe that you're not running again
you have at least   at least another 12 good, solid years in the senate if you wanted them
you have to do it
you're sure, right
okay
he's made that decision
but, pat, thank you very much
and this is very important to pat and to mike rounds, because what's happened here, if you look, it's so much about everything you stand for, especially the farmers
and the farmers are going to be so happy
where is mike rounds
mike
mike
stand up, mike
he's another one
he was brutal to me
he would call
i got to get this done
you got to get it done
right
thank you very much, mike
fantastic job
and dan sullivan, from the great state of alaska
and i stop there every time i can, right
and i won by a lot
they like me in alaska, right
but they like you too, dan
and thank you very much
kevin mccarthy, as you know, left for the hoax
well, we have to do that, otherwise it becomes a more serious hoax
and mark meadows is a friend of mine, right from the beginning
thank you, mark, very much
special guy
special friend
great wife, too
his wife actually supported me long before him, but he thinks i don't know that
she went on women for trump, when it wasn't so fashionable
like, on the worst day of my life, she was doing women for trump tours with 50 women on buses all over the great state of north carolina
she's fantastic
vern buchanan
thank you very much
thank you, vern
great job you've done
mike conaway
thanks, mike
thank you, mike
by the way, kristi, thank you for being here
i didn't know you were going to be here
thank you
stand up
we're going to do a big fireworks display, right
mount rushmore
we're going over   i think i'm going to try and be there on july 4th
so, the governor called
she ran a great race, a tough race
that was a tough competitor you had, right
a big star
and   but she was a bigger star, it turned out, lindsey
but she said, do you think we can get fireworks back at mount rushmore
i said, why
they haven't been there for   like for 20 years
i said, why
environmental reasons
i said, you mean you can't have fireworks because of the environment
yeah, environmental reasons
i said, what can burn
it's stone
you know, it's stone
it's granite
so nobody knew why
they just said, environmental reasons
so i called up our people
and within about 15 minutes, we got it approved, and you're going to have your first big fireworks display at mount rushmore, and i'll try and get out there if i can
okay
right
that'll be great
thank you very much for being here
thanks, kristi

michael mccaul
you did a phenomenal job three, four days ago, mike, with your speech on the floor
that was incredible
very inspiring
patrick mchenry
he's a   number one, he's a great guy
and number two, he's got the best name in politics
if i had that name, i would have won 20 years ago
patrick mchenry
a man who's got such courage   honestly, he deserves a medal
he'll probably get one
we still have to win to get medals though, right
we can't give medals if we don't win
but this guy has never lost in his life
he is so tough and so smart
devin nunes
thank you
stand up, devin
everybody knows him
what they put him through     what these phony people, what these dirty cops and all of the others put you through   and, man, you survived it better than ever, and everyone respects you

so, thank you, devin, very much
great job
adrian smith
thank you, adrian
thank you very much
and don't feel   again, you guys are all set
i've introduced you   not much more for you, but you know
but you're going to hear some great things about china, and you're going to hear some also great things now because we have a who's who of the world of business with us today
david abney, of ups
david
where are you, david
you can stand up, if anybody wants to
if you don't want it   you know, if your company is not doing well, you may not want to stand up
but ups is doing very well
there will be a couple that will just sort of slink back into their chair
they'll pretend they're not here
thank you, david
great job you've done
darius adamczyk, of honeywell
a great company
thank you very much
great equipment you make
i have a lot of it
i use a lot of it, and the country uses a lot of it
ajay banga, of mastercard
thank, ajay
fantastic job
josh bolten, business roundtable
thank you, josh
great job
david calhoun
he's got a very easy company to run
he just took over boeing
where's david
david
where's david
well, thank you very much and i'm thrilled to be back in wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago
you remember that very big night
remember that
they said donald trump has won the state of wisconsin
and since then, we've produced everything we said and more and more
before it was talk
i said i'm going to do this, we're going to take care of your trade
what we've done with china now on wednesday we sign
that's tomorrow
what we've done with the usmca
what we've done with japan, $40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers
south korea, oh, you got to love trump
you got to love trump, and you're a great green bay packers are playing san francisco this week
good luck
so, do we have any green bay packers fans here today
that's wonderful and you have a great quarterback, who's a good guy, good guy
as we begin the year, our economy is booming, wages are rising, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, and america is the envy of the entire world
and then our opponents say, we're not going to win
let's impeach president trump
let's impeach him
got the greatest economy in our history
our military has been totally rebuilt
let's impeach him
but we've created 7 million jobs since the election, including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs
nobody thought that was possible and we will soon be replacing the nafta catastrophe
one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world, frankly
with the incredible usmca, canada, mexico, a giant victory for wisconsin workers, farmers, and dairy producers, a tremendous victory
and we may get that all taken care of this week or next week
it just needs one more vote and we'll get that out of the republican senate
the republican senate will be great
tomorrow, we'll also be signing our phase 1 trade deal with china, massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of wisconsin
so, after years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the united states military to a point that it has never been before, and it is now more advanced, more lethal and more powerful than ever
and last year, our great american warriors, because that's what they are and they love it
i got to tell you
i know some   they love it, right
they love doing that
they wouldn't trade places with me under any circumstance
they wouldn't trade places with all of our great wisconsin politicians
they want to be a military warrior and we don't want them for that
we want them doing what they are doing, but our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of isis
the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed
and i will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago, isis was all over the place
now the caliphate is 100% destroyed
remember when i wanted to leave when it was at 98%
i said let some of the other countries finish it off
we're going home, right
they all said, oh no, sir
please, finish it
so, we finished it off
it's 100%
a few days ago, we took bold and decisive action to defend american lives and deliver american justice
at my direction, the united states military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's no
1 terrorist, no
1 terrorist
you know who that is
qasem soleimani, no
1 terrorist in the world
soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of americans and was actively planning new attacks, but we stopped them cold
and frankly, they already started the attack, as you saw in baghdad, on our very large embassy in baghdad
that was already started and i said to our generals get there
we don't want to have another benghazi, on my watch, on any watch
they said, sir, we'll be there tomorrow
i said, no, you got to be there right now
get them over there now, now
they have thousands of soldiers, they were soldiers if you take a look at that crowd
that was not protesters, they were soldiers and they were surrounding our embassy in baghdad
and all of a sudden, they see these beautiful, very expensive, i will tell you, brand new apache helicopters roaming over the top
and then they see our great military
you saw them in the plane, right
some of them were getting out of their pajamas
they were, i said don't worry about that
we won't put that on, but they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane, right
and it was a beautiful sight, and these guys were better than tom cruise, at his best
all right
so tomorrow with the fake news, here's your headline, here's your headline
you know, we have thousands of people outside wanting to get in
they can't because you people got here first, but so here's your headline tomorrow, protesters disturb the rally, one protester, a very weak voice
you know a few people wouldn't go crazy every time you see something, you'd go right through it
nobody would even know she was there
now she's gone home to mom, where she will be in big trouble because i guarantee you that mom voted for trump
and in 10 years from now, when i run yet again, she'll be voting for trump too
i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding
we drive them crazy, we drive them crazy
they say, you know, he's not leaving, don't you
he's never leaving
they say he's going to win, he's never going to leave
you know these people, it's called trump derangement syndrome, it really is
they are   they are so good
you know what they don't know is that for any reason, after five years we do leave, which we will because i believe in that stuff, right
but you know what's going to happen to their industry
they're all going to die and fall down
it's going to be very boring out there, very boring
that's why i say at some point, every single one of them will be endorsing donald trump
but crazy bernie sanders and the washington democrats, by the way, bernie is searching
bernie, bernie is searching, bernie
but the democrats are outraged that we killed this terrorist monster, even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death
that's true
hey, speaking of protesters, have you seen what's happened
in iran, the protesters are on our side first time ever, right
they're on our side
in fact, they put this big american flag on the street and the iranians, thousands and thousands of iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it
every one of them went around that flag
they like trump
they like you
i'm just your representative, but they like us
they like us
they haven't seen anything like that in a long time
they want to   did you see it
they went around the flag
they didn't want to touch it
they love america, they love our country
that's called progress
that's called progress
but the democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster
you know, many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms or without legs and without   were done by soleimani
that's what he loved
he loved the roadside bomb
that's what he loved
thousands and thousands and thousands in iraq and afghanistan, roadside bombs
he was the king of the roadside bombs
great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch, ok
and the democrat should be outraged by soleimani's evil crimes, not the decision to end his wretched life
they're saying, well, he was a general
he was this, he was that
you know what, number one, he wasn't supposed to be there
he was a designated terrorist by president obama, who didn't do anything about it as usual, as usual
they don't do anything
they designate and they don't do anything about it
he should have been killed 20 years ago
now, here's the story with the democrats
if i didn't kill him, and let's say, we lost three, four, five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed, they would have said trump should have taken him out
anything we do they go the opposite
so we kill him and that was precision
some people thought it went much too fast, went too fast
so, we kill him and they say what a horrible   if we didn't kill him they'd say what a horrible thing, right
you know with the wall, we're building a wall
you know that, right
and by the way, they think they caught me and they'd never catch us because, you know, mexico's paying for the wall
you know that
you'll see that
it's all worked out
mexico spent   it's driving them crazy
now they say ok, he's building the wall, but mexico didn't pay and mexico will pay
and here's the thing, here's the thing, you'll see that it'll come out
we'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch
the people are going to watch because nobody's watching
you know, they haven't   they haven't been doing great on the debates
i have to tell you, but we are building this wall, we're over 100 miles right now
we're going to be expanding the length
we have a lot of natural   well, you have 1,978 miles
you need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great
we're going to now get it up
we have all the financing
you think it's easy getting financing
when people put   i can get anything from them
i can get whatever i want in terms of money, except for a wall, and i made one big mistake
i should have said to them we will not build the wall, we don't want the wall, they would have insisted that we build it
we would have had all the money we wanted
i made a mistake
i made a big mistake
now, we're building a wall
it's going up and it's going up rapidly and very soon, we'll be building about a mile a day, and we should be up to over 400 miles by next year, the end of next year, and shortly thereafter, it'll be finished
and it's already having a tremendous impact on people, not being able to come into our country
bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country, nor do they want to, i think
according to elizabeth pocahontas warren,  who has somewhat less indian blood in her than i do, and i have none
remember
oh, we hit it hard, but i hit her too early
but now, it doesn't matter
she's not going anywhere, but bernie said, according to her bernie said this
i don't believe that he said this because, you know, i don't know him
i don't particularly like him
he's a nasty guy, but i don't believe he said it
it's not his deal
you have to know what people say
she said, right
that bernie said it strongly that a woman can't win for president
a woman can win for president
fortunately, it is   that could happen, that could happen
who knows
but she said that bernie said a woman can't win
i don't believe that bernie said that
i really don't
so you know just   bernie, it's not the kind of thing he'd say
if you want to keep america safe, just vote republican
we're doing so well
we're doing so well
now, this was the   i   leave him   leave him alone
let security just take care of it
you all right
get him out of here
good
good job, security
good job
do we love law enforcement
do we love them
and is there ever, ever a better place to be than a trump rally on some night during some week
you know the truth is, we have a great time, but you know what, more importantly, we get things done
we get everything done, but even president obama's own former national security adviser, a highly respected general named jim jones, praised our action to take out soleimani and said it was absolutely correct, and it was the absolute right thing to do
i'm sure   i'm sure they like him very much
he sounds like my kind of guy
so jim, if they're giving you a hard time, come on over to the republican party, really
no, he's a respected guy
he said we did the right thing
everyone knows
they're saying was the attack imminent
was it imminent
does the fact that he's killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands, that doesn't matter
was the attack imminent
i think they're going to start a new investigation
was the attack on this   and by the way, he was in a country he wasn't allowed to be in
you know, we don't mention that because he was designated and he wasn't allowed to be there and he was there with the head of hezbollah and they were talking about, like, hillary clinton
they were talking about weddings and working out, right
soleimani and the head of hezbollah, they were talking about weddings, working out or bill clinton in the back of the airplane with the attorney general
where they may have made her an offer that you're going to go to the supreme court or they may have said you're going to stay attorney general
but help, help, they may have said that
do you think they would have said that
no, nothing like that, but remember, they talked about golf and grandchildren, right
45 minutes
you know, i like golf and i love my grandchildren
i don't think i can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that i don't even know, 45
i have a beautiful grandchild
he's really beautiful, he's so great
ok, what else am i going to say, right
then
i talk   let's talk one or two, how's tiger doing
how's this one, how's that one
that's another five minutes, right
what am i going to do with the other 35 minutes
maybe, i'm going to talk about supreme court appointments, etc
well, we're doing very well
but at this very moment, the good people of iraq are taking to the streets in numbers like nobody's seen before, and they're really protesting the repressive regime and demanding a better future
you know, they're great people
they're great   the great people of iran, they're great people
they get it
and they're tired of watching their leaders plunder iran to stoke violence and death and war
and you know, iran's caused these problems for 40 years, just so you understand
reagan had it, iran contract
carter had it, 52 hostages, how about that
destroyed his presidency
he was pretty well destroyed before that   but it didn't help
actually, probably got reagan elected, if you think about it, right
but, no, carter had it, 52 hostages
reagan had iran contract
obama had just, you know, he was like begging them for everything, but obama gave them $150 billion, $1
8 billion in cash
he got zero
he got zero out of it
he got zero
i'd love to have that money back
it's a lot of money, but i've warned the ayatollah and the government of iran that they must not harm, hurt or kill any protesters
the whole world is watching, it's watching
they've killed thousands of protesters
we support the iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom
it's incredible what's going on over there
it really is, but we're watching them and we're watching very closely and we were ready
you know that night when the attack was made on us
the attack was made on us
remember this, they killed an american
they killed other people just before that
and so, we did what we did, right
and they said it's our turn now
i said you better be careful when you say it's our turn because we had designated targets that you wouldn't   it would have taken them 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible
that's true, that's true
and we saw those missiles launch and they were big and they were fast and they were accurate
four of them went bad, they fell way short, but twelve of them had, and i said, man they are quick
they knew immediately what they were and they saw those missiles hit
i said how bad is it
it hit a base and an hour later or so, we get a callback
i said how many killed
nobody, sir
i said how many hurt
they said nobody, sir
and i said they just saved themselves $1 trillion and a lot of lives
it's true, $1 trillion, not $1 billion, $1 trillion
so, they did a very smart thing and we're not looking for regime change
they've tried that with libya
they go, hillary clinton, let's get rid of   let's get rid of libya
let's get rid of gaddafi
let's get rid of gaddafi
how's that working out, right
let's get rid of gaddafi, that was a hillary deal
then, you had benghazi and see benghazi, they didn't respond, they didn't respond
and then, we had iraq
should be
they went into iraq
the geniuses go into iraq
iraq didn't knock down the world trade center, just in case anybody had any question and this guy did kill
he was not a sweetheart
he was a bad guy in every way, but he did kill terrorists, right
and it became harvard university for terrorists, right
but they did go after him, but he didn't knock down the world trade center
so, it got a lot of bad thinking, but we're doing a good job
we're getting the hell out
we're moving and we did something in syria
we were guarding their border
at one point, we had thousands of people, the syrian border between turkey and syria
it's been there for a thousand years
they've been fighting for many, many years under different names
i said i'm getting our soldiers out of there
i did
i took them out, and you know what i did with the soldiers
no, they don't tell you the true story because they're a bunch of corrupt people back there
it's true
i told turkey, you got to defend your own border
we're not going to defend your border and we get along with turkey, we get along
but they've been there for   and by the way, i call it a safe zone
that is the most dangerous safe zone in the world, ok
i'm looking at the audience, there is about three of you that want to be in that zone, ok
and you're very tough people, but this is the most danger   i call it   i call it a safe zone
someday it may be a safe zone, but i took our soldiers out because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here and they were going to fight
i said if they're going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years, for centuries
let them fight, but we're getting the hell out of there, ok
but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story, but the fake news doesn't tell you the right story
because what i did is i took our soldiers, and you know what i did
i moved them to the oil area and we now control the oil
so, they said trump stayed in syria
trump stayed
so people said to me, why are you staying in syria
because i kept the oil, which frankly, we should have done in iraq, ok, a long time ago
you have no idea, the things and the decisions i've seen
so they say trump stayed, i didn't pull out
i did pull out
we have the oil really secure
we'll see what happens with it, but we can help our friends the kurds because that's where they got their wealth
and then ultimately, it was with isis, it was with   but right now, it's with the united states military, and we also got rid of remnants of isis
while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, democrats in congress are wasting america's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that have been going on, by the way, from the day i came down the escalator with our future first lady
somebody said to me recently, president, president, it was a friend of mine
he used to always call me, donald
hey donald, how are you doing
let's go out, ok, good
now he calls me president
i tell you this   they always call me president
president, president, tell me what's happening
what's going on
how's it all going
you're doing such a great job
i said do me a favor call me donald
i can't
now when they say   you know what that means, right
that means respect for the office of president, and you know what
we're going to keep it that way
we're going to keep it that way
we're going to keep it that way
but that's why this november, we're going back and we're going to win the house
republicans are going to win the house because i don't know if you know it, the impeachment hoax
it's a total hoax
a part   this is base   just think of this
this is based on a perfect phone call
did anybody read the transcript
it's a perfect call
in fact, if you go back and look at lyndon johnson, all of them
take a little   you know lyndon johnson was sort of a tough guy
can you imagine his phone calls
he's probably looking down or looking up and he's probably   and he's probably saying these people have gone crazy
that's the nicest call i've ever   in fact, somebody said i never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call
but this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate with the president of ukraine said there was no pressure on us, didn't even know what they were talking about
the foreign minister said they want to impeach, impeach the president of the united states over a perfect phone call
it's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country, ever
but we're going to go back and because of it, in wisconsin, i don't know if you seen it
independent voters and voters, i think of all   of all of the voters, including democrats moving over
we just got 195 to nothing, the republicans in the house, which was a fix
we've got a hundred   you know, nancy pelosi says it must be non-partisan
it must   and she said it has to be clear cut
well, number one never happened, no problem
number two, look at the vote
three democrats voted with us
so i guess you could say, i guess you could say it was a non-partisan vote because they voted with us, ok
but we're going back and we're going to hold the senate and we're going to keep the white house
but we're going to win back the house
we're going to win back the house
and i'm thrilled tonight, a man who's become a great friend of mine
he's a warrior, senator ron johnson is here
come up, ron
what a good guy
congressman bryan steil, jim sensenbrenner, glenn grothman
glenn, come up, come up
mike gallagher, wisconsin house speaker robin vos, wisconsin state senate president, roger roth, state senate president
wisconsin's state senate majority leader, scott fitzgerald
a friend of mine, a world champion, freak
he climbs   would you believe it
is sean here
where's sean
where's sean
get up here
i love champions
he would climb that sucker
he was the best in the world, right here from wisconsin, right
congressman sean duffy
you miss him, but you know he signed with cnn
they paid him a lot of money and they don't put him on
why
because i'm pro-trump, you think that's fair, right
he's pro-trump
so, what they've done is pay the money to silence him because he has a very important voice
i like that kind of a job
i think he's ok
he gets his check, they refused to put him on
he says good things about trump
we don't want you on, that's cnn
that's how fake right there
turn the camera off
and a good friend of all of ours, a kenosha native, reince priebus
reince, come up
thank you, man
thank you, reince
this is a great group of republican people, but more importantly, it's a great group of winners
they have been so great, so   they worked so hard and they just want to thank you all for being here tonight
thank you, ron, a great guy
thanks to strong republican leadership like ron, like all of them that you just saw, america is winning again, america is respected again, and america is thriving again like never before
we're doing great
we're the envy of the world
and under my administration, we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country
and in your great state, wisconsin   do you ever notice with biden, he's always going on the wrong name
and in your great state of iowa, iowa
it's iowa, right
no, it's wisconsin
oh, i meant wisconsin
oh, i didn't know i was in wisconsin
that's fine
how many times has he done that
by the way, lots of times he said
it's great to be in the state of ohio
no, sir, you're in, you're in florida, many times
the sad part about that, sleepy joe is right
do you know the sad part about that
when you do that, you can't really recover
you can be winston churchill, make the finest remainder of remarks, but you get killed and he does it every time
and the fake news, they give him a total pass and that's ok, it's all right
it's going to happen to all of us someday
does anybody get that yet
in wisconsin, the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history
how's that for a sound bite
how do you beat that sound bite, right
so now, the people of wisconsin say, well, let's see, the state set a record, the most successful it's ever been
by the way, that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named scott walker
ron johnson, all those guys, because this didn't happen so quickly, but think
so, how do you beat that
you have the most successful lowest unemployment rate you've ever had, and then, they say somebody is going to come and say we'll do a better job, really, going to do a better job
the lowest in history by far, your number one economic numbers by far
oh, let's put somebody else in as president
i don't think so, right
but here's one that i love the most, african-american, hispanic-american, asian-american unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country
and here's another one, african-american youth, you know, the way it was so high, it was so horrible
youth unemployment has reached an all-time low in recorded history
african-american poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also
and by the way, just out of curiosity, how are your 401(k)s doing
are they good
the only question, are you at 70, 80, 90, 97
he goes, higher
what are you at
what's yours
100%, not bad
i know who he's voting for but think of this, because this is what it's about
is that   you know, these companies, these big public companies, they're owned by the people, they're owned by everybody, rich people and they're owned by everybody
thank you, laura
well, i don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in baghdad
you saw that happening
you saw with all of the men, very few women, circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get and they were close to getting in, and i called out the military
they said we'll have it there tomorrow
i said, nope, you'll have it there today
we're not going to have another benghazi on our hands
and we did a really amazing job
i get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything, and that's ok
in the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things
but i think you would have had another benghazi had we not acted quickly
that could have been stopped, and this was stopped
and we had our apaches going there, the great helicopters, and they were dropping flares all over the place, and a lot of things were happening
they had acted real fast and everybody disappeared
but
i can reveal that i believe it would have been four embassies
and i think that probably baghdad already started
they were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force
we came in with very powerful force and drove them out
that ended almost immediately
but baghdad certainly would've been the lead
but i think it would've been four embassies that had been military bases   could've been a lot of other things too, but it was imminent
and then all of a sudden he was gone
yes, he is a great supporter
he's a friend of mine
he called me just a little while ago and he said i just wanted to get some more information
and he was   look, i have also had calls from some of the senators
some of the congressmen said it was the single best briefing
one person said they have been there for 10 years
it's the single best briefing they've ever had
one said 20 years, the single best military briefing they've ever had
i understand what mike had, mike wanted certain things said and we just couldn't say and we could probably say maybe individually to him
and he's certainly a trustworthy person
i am worried about it, certainly
i am worried about it
can you imagine
here we are, split-second timing, executed   like nobody's seen in many, many years   on soleimani
can you imagine they want us to call out and speak to crooked corrupt politician adam schiff
oh, adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time
we have a shot at him right now
could we meet so that we can get your approval, adam schiff
and he'd say, well, let's do it in a couple of days
oh, ok, let's wait a couple   it doesn't work that way, number one
number two, they leak
anything we give will be leaked immediately
you'll see breaking news, we're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something
and by the way, i'm not somebody that wants to attack
i probably could've attacked 5 times, 10 times having to do with iran
i've been very guarded because i don't want to do that
but we may have to do something
we have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint
but hopefully it won't be necessary
we have tremendous sanctions
they're doing very poorly
they have riots all over their country
and they can straighten it out easy but it's up to them
whatever they want to do
yes
she hates israel
she hates jewish people
and you just have to take a look at her rhetoric
it's incredible what's happened to the democrats in congress
they used to be supportive of israel
today they are supportive of her and tlaib
that's another real winner, tlaib, and aoc who knows nothing
aoc knows nothing
poor student, poor everything and then she comes and she talks about the green new deal and all these poor fools
say, oh, isn't it wonderful
isn't it wonderful
but as i said last night in ohio, i don't like talking about the green new deal
it's too early
i want to save it for about two weeks before because they may change their mind
i don't see it happening
we are there for a very, very strong reason
they cannot have nuclear weapons
the iran nuclear deal signed by president obama gave them $150 billion, and that's when the real terror started
they took that money and they used it all over the place
you look at yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening, including syria, they were using   i want to say they gave $1
8 billion in cash   $1
7 billion, $1
8 billion in cash
green cash, beautiful, green cash
you almost say where do they   how do they have the power to do this
plane loads of cash   and instead of iran saying thank you very much
that's really nice
let's go and get along
let's do well
let's do deals together
let's build buildings in iran   they said death to america and they said it when they were signing
when kerry signed   and by the way, kerry violated the logan act
well, no
he totally violated
this man totally violated the logan act with his conversations, ok
but when kerry was out there and making the deal, and they have people screaming, death to america
death to america, i say, who signs a deal while they're screaming death to america
this was
if you look at the middle east right now, it's much tamer than it was when i got in
when i got in, it was just all over the place
number one, we got rid of the caliphate   the isis caliphate
we have tens of thousands of isis prisoners
we've killed most of their fighters
we've gotten rid of isis
now, they come back and we take care of it
other people should take care of it
other countries should take care of it
europe did take them back
yes
so when i came in, as you know, nato was virtually a dead organization
it had no money
nobody was paying except us
practically nobody was paying
if you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a roller coaster down
now, and secretary stoltenberg, i think he's terrific
in my first year, i raised $130 billion from them, not from us, and now he just announced $530 billion all because of me
he's my biggest salesman, my greatest salesman, secretary stoltenberg
but i said to him, look, you're there for russia and europe, ok
by the way, nato's much more for europe than it is for us, and yet we pay
we're protecting them   we're protecting
well, they build and office building for $3 billion
they do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before i got here, but i raised a lot of money
we can use nato in other locations
we can use nato as an example in the middle east, and that's what we should do
and frankly, it's more palatable to countries in the middle east if an international force comes in rather than just the united states
and from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it
why are we always paying
we pay for everything
one thing, i moved my troops out of syria   on the border between turkey and syria
that turned out to be such a successful move, laura
look what happened
now they protect their own   they've been fighting over that border for 1,000 years
why should we do it
and then they say he left troops in syria
you know what i did
i left troops to take the oil
i took the oil
the only troops i have are taking the oil
they're protecting the oil
i took over
well, maybe we will
maybe we won't
i don't know
maybe we should take it, but we have the oil
right now, the united states has the oil
so they say he left troops in syria
i got rid of all of them other than we're protecting the oil
we have the oil
yes
well, it's not   it's fake news
they just made it up
it's fake news
i used to think leakers
they just make it up
they're all very dishonest, most of them are really just   i mean, 80 percent are dishonest, and i mean really dishonest
they made that story up
you notice the way they
well they don't   no, not at all
by the way, absolutely not at all
we have tremendous support
look, in the house we are 196 to nothing, and we got three democrats
so therefore it was bipartisan, i guess you can say
we got   nothing, they had nothing
we didn't lose one republican vote, as you know, that's very unusual
in the senate, i think i have the same, if not more support
i don't have to do that
i would never compromise what we're doing with iran and potential war, and all of the things that   where we're doing so well
you know what i want in the middle east
i don't people having nuclear weapons because they'll use them
i don't want people having nuclear weapons
that's my biggest thing
you know how bad the iran deal was
the iran deal, i did a great thing getting out of the iran deal
they gave them 150   they gave them the 1
8 billion, forget that
you couldn't do inspections at the most important locations
and you know another big thing
they have the right to do ballistic missiles
we couldn't go into areas and, look, we'd have to give massive notices
so if they were doing something, they could clean them up
it was ridiculous
but most importantly, it expires
this is a short-term agreement
and now, once it expired, they have an absolute, clear, unstopped path to have nuclear weapons, unstopped
in a very short period of time, the deal that president obama made with john kerry, who may be the worst negotiator i've ever seen, that deal expires
and you know what
once it expires, you can't do what i did, i mean, because they have a deal that says, once it expires, they can do what they want to do
you cannot let iran have a nuclear weapon, that's what i'm doing
well, a couple of people started that and they got hit real fast by a lot of different people, not me
i think it's just low life   look, he's not going anywhere, he was a lousy mayor of a place that is not doing well, and indiana is doing unbelievably well
indiana, the state had the best year they've ever had, thank you very much
but that city was badly run
if you look at what's going on
he's going nowhere, and she's another beauty
i mean, take a look at her past
check out her past, please
i don't
i'm ok
i'm ok with it
by the way, listen
listen just so you understand
that's what they say
i don't
i'm ok with it
by the way
that's what they say publicly
they don't say that privately
because if we leave, that means they're not going to be able to
i'm not so bad with it
when i heard that, i said   i have it down to 5,000 troops
we had many, many troops there in iraq
and we're there only in the training
we train them
but if they want us to leave   but they speak different publicly than they do privately
we're sending more to saudi arabia and saudi arabia's paying us for it
we're doing something that nobody's ever done
i said to saudi arabia   we have a very good relationship with saudi arabia
i said listen, you're a very rich country
you want more troops, i'm going to send them to you but you've got to pay us
they're paying us
they've already deposited $1 billion in the bank
we are going to help them but these rich countries have to pay for it
south korea gave us $500 million
they've never gave us   they gave us $500 million
i said you got to help us along
we have 32,000 soldiers in south korea protecting it from north korea
you've got to pay
and they gave us $500 million
i mean you saw that breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff
i'm not sure anybody knows it
it might be sort of saying you have some   i mean, that's good stuff
but they're a wealthy country
they build all your television sets
they took that away from us
they build the ships
they've built a lot of things
i said look, we're protecting you, you got to pay
they paid us $500 million
they're going to pay us a lot more
sure
you heard that from me
absolutely
i said we built one of the world's most expensive airport facilities anywhere in the world
i mean i wish we had it in new york
i wish we had it in washington
we build runways that are 15,000 feet long
at laguardia they're 7,000 feet long
in fact, i think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel
nobody ever built runways like this
ok, it's way over built but that's ok
but we have billions of dollars into that
i said if we leave you got to pay us
if we leave, you have to pay us by embassies
you have to pay us for the money we put in
good morning, everyone
today, we're taking another historic step in our campaign to slash job-killing regulations and improve the quality of life for all of our citizens
in the past, many america's   of america's most critical infrastructure projects have been tied up and bogged down by an outrageously slow and burdensome federal approval process
and i've been talking about it for a long time   where it takes many, many years to get something built   get something built   done in any way
the builders are not happy
nobody is happy
it takes 20 years
it takes 30 years
it take numbers that nobody would even believe
these endless delays waste money, keep projects from breaking ground, and deny jobs to our nation's incredible workers
from day one, my administration has made fixing this regulatory nightmare a top priority
and we want to build new roads, bridges, tunnels, highways bigger, better, faster, and we want to build them at less cost
that is why, for the first time in over 40 years, today we are issuing a proposed new rule under the national environmental policy act to completely overhaul the dysfunctional bureaucratic system that has created these massive obstructions
now, we're going to have very strong regulation, but it's going to go very quickly
and if it doesn't pass, it's going to not pass quickly
it doesn't have to take 10 years or much longer than that
these proposed reforms will reduce traffic in our cities, connect our rural communities, and get americans where they need to go more quickly and more safely
we're pleased to be joined by secretary david bernhardt, secretary elaine chao, administrator andrew wheeler, and council on environmental quality chairwoman mary neumayr
they've done a fantastic job on this
also with us are representatives of the american workers from across the country, including president of the north america's building trades unions, sean mcgarvey
president of the national cattlemen's beef association, jennifer houston
president of the american trucking associations, chris spear
and many other leaders of labor and industry
america is a nation of builders
it took four years to build the golden gate bridge, five years to build the hoover dam, and less than one year   can you believe that
to build the empire state building
yet today, it can take more than 10 years just to get a permit to build a simple road   just a very simple road
and usually, you're not even able to get the permit
it's unusual when you get it
it's big government at its absolute worst, and other countries look at us and they can't believe it
for example, in north carolina, it took 25 years to begin construction of the marc basnight bridge
in alaska, improvements on a 15-mile stretch of sterling highway   the only road connecting local communities to the rest of the state, and a very dangerous area   it's been delayed for over 15 years, but we're getting it started
in washington state, it took two decades to finish environmental reviews for the runway at the seattle-tacoma international airport
think of that
it takes decades
the united states will not be able to compete and prosper in the 21st century if we continue to allow a broken and outdated bureaucratic system hold us back from building what we need
the roads, the airports, the schools, everything
right now, it takes over seven years, and oftentimes much longer   and seven years is like record time   to complete approvals for a simple highway   the simplest of them
with today's proposed reforms, we will reduce that number by more than 70 percent
we'll cut the federal permitting timeline for major projects down to two years
and ideally, we're going to try and get even less than that
so you'll be   instead of 21, 22, 25, 8, 9, 12, 15   we're going to get it down to 2 years and maybe less, with strong regulation, especially environmental and safety regulation
but we'll get it down to a very low number
and we're going to do it fast
we're doing it with a rule change that just is being signed
in the past, those seeking infrastructure permits have had to go to numerous federal departments all over   numerous
and numerous means many, many
sometimes you get the same exact change, but you had to get them from different departments
so you would go to these federal departments and agencies requesting approval from countless governmental bureaucrats, each of whom was empowered to hold up the process and leave urgently needed projects in limbo, and for the most part they wouldn't get built
if they did get built, it would take so many years and cost many times more
but our new one federal decision policy   it's called one federal decision   requires agencies to work closely together to promptly deliver one decision
yes
the entire process will be completed
the entire federal government approval process will be done
we're also cutting red tape by allowing federal departments to increase the use of documentation prepared by state, tribal, and local governments
this is just common sense and there's no need to do all of the duplicate work
there's so much duplication
you'd go for a permit
you'd have to go for another permit
they were all   they would turn out to be all the same permits
you're just going to different agencies to get the same approval
at the same time, we're maintaining america's world-class standards of environmental protection
we have some of the cleanest air and cleanest water on earth
and for our country, the air is, right now, cleaner than it's been in 40 years
i guess you go before that, there was a lot less activity
so we're competing   i would imagine, 200 years ago, it was great
five hundred years ago, before we got here, it must have been really nice, right
but in the last 40 years, it's the cleanest right now
by streamlining infrastructure approvals, we'll further expand america's unprecedented economic boom
and that's what we have
we have an economic boom
we've created 7 million jobs, including over 700,000 construction jobs
unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years
after years of stagnation, real wages have increased nearly 10 percent for low-income workers   the biggest beneficiaries
our regulation cuts are giving the average american household an extra $3,000 per year
and if you look at the tax cuts and all of the other cuts, it's close to $10,000 a year   with all of the cuts that we're getting
and that's for an average median-income family   $10,000
you know, i've talked about past administrations   the one was $475, and the other one was $975   the last two, $975
and we're $10,000, and the number is actually higher that   than that, if you include certain regulations that we got cut
so that's an amazing thing, and that's one of the reasons consumers are doing so well and leading us so strongly in this boom that we're in
but this is just the beginning
we'll not stop until our nation's gleaming new infrastructure has made america the envy of the world again
it used to be the envy of the world, and now we're like a third-world country
it's really sad
you get approval   they even get financing for jobs, and then they can't build them for 15 years, and then it ends up costing five times more than it was supposed to cost
so i'd now   now like to ask chairwoman mary neumayr to say a few words
and we're going to have another couple of speakers, and then we'll take some questions
go ahead
thank you
thank you
come on over here, mary
thank you very much
i appreciate it
thank you
thanks, mary
thanks a lot
and if i could, secretary chao
secretary chao
thank you
please
thank you, elaine
thank you
thank you, elaine
i want to also thank elaine for doing a great job
she's doing a fantastic job
secretary bernhardt, please
wow
big statement
please, andrew wheeler   where is andrew
come on, andrew
great job
thank you
sean
please
sean mcgarvey
thank you very much
would you like to say something
thank you very much
thank you very much
and for the cattlemen and cattlewomen, we're signing, as you know, a very big deal, among many other things, with china
probably january 15th
and we just signed a $40 billion deal with japan
that's already kicked in
you see that
we did south korea
we have others that we've done and some that we're doing
we have tremendous trade deals being made
houston
i appreciate iand they're actually good deals for our country instead of bad deals for our country
so it's been good
i'm going to ohio in a little while
we have crowds of people that for, two and a half, three days, have been standing out in the cold
i don't know how they do it
they're strong people
but they've been out there, and it's pretty much zero degrees
and it's a great state
and we have a tremendous crowd, so i look forward to that
i'll be leaving in a little while
but we'll take a few questions
please
yeah
well, phase one is a big, big number
it's a big percentage of the deal
some would say half, some would say a little less, or a little more than half
but it's a tremendous percentage
it's pretty much all for the farmers   also, bankers
we also have regulations for a lot of different   a lot of things are covered that people are going to be very surprised to see, but it's a big chunk of it
and we'll start right away negotiating phase two
it'll take a little time
i think i might want to wait to finish it until after the election, because by doing that i think we can actually make a little bit better deal   maybe a lot better deal
but phase one was   is a phenomenal deal
could be up to $50 billion in farm product
so that's something that   the most they ever did was $16 billion
so they go from $16 billion to up to $50 billion
so that's numerous times more than they were buying in the past
it's going to have a huge impact
and i see farm prices are going way up
i see corn is just   had some big increases over the last little while
cattle has been doing really well
and the farmers liked me anyway
that's what i like about the farmers
but you know what i did do   and you know this better than anybody   i got   i was able   they were targeted by china
you know   look, china is negotiating
i don't blame them
but they were targeted
they say, you know, the farmers like trump so we'll target the farmers
and they did
and the first year was $12 billion, and i took $12 billion and i asked sonny perdue, secretary of agriculture, what do you think, sonny
he said, it's $12 billion
and i think that would've caused tremendous consternation
and they were hit for $12 billion, and i took $12 billion out of the tariffs
we had tens of billions of dollars left over
i gave it to the farmers
the next year it was $16 billion
i took $16 billion out of the tariffs
i gave it to the farmers
so the farmers did pretty well, and now they're doing great
and the prices are going up very substantially, and china is kicking in
china has already started to buy
japan   the deal is done
they have been buying
it's a $40 billion deal
but the big question i have is whether or not the farmers will be able to supply that much
because it's much more than   it's the biggest contract ever signed
so i think it'll be great for the farmers, but also great for regulatory, great for banks
you know that
great for finance companies
really, a lot
then we're going to covering the opening of china and various other things in phase two
well, i'm going to leave it to the senate, but i'd like to hear the whistleblower
i'd like to hear shifty schiff
i'd like to hear hunter biden and joe biden
you know
how does hunter biden, with no experience whatsoever   would anybody up   sean, would you like the hunter biden job
he has no experience, making no money, and then all of a sudden, see, he's making millions and millions of dollars
you'd take that
would you leave the union for that
i think so
i know so, but i'm not going to tell
no, no i'd like to hear from hunter biden
i'd like to hear from   he's a corrupt politician, adam schiff
he's corrupt
he gave a sentence
you know, he never knew i was going to release the transcript
he gave a sentence that he made up
he made it up
and it was not the   it was not what was said in the conversation
that's why i released the transcript
got approval from ukraine
we released the exact transcript, and it turned out to be totally different
these are corrupt politicians
the whole thing is a hoax
but i would like to hear hunter biden, joe biden, adam shifty schiff, and some others   the informer that never showed up
you know, once i released the transcript, you know what happened
the informer   he never showed up
and the second whistleblower   jon, whatever happened to the second whistleblower
the second whistleblower disappeared
there probably was none or maybe we know who the second whistleblower was
maybe we do
but he never showed up
all of a sudden, they don't talk, because they were really unexpectedly met with the actual conversation, the exact conversation
so yeah, if we do that, i would like to have those people, plus others, testify
because it's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the united states government
this has gone on since the day i came down the escalator
this isn't just here
this isn't just the ukraine hoax
this is the witch hunt
this is the whole thing with russia that turned out to be a total fabricated plot
the ones who are guilty are the democrats, the dnc, and all of the dirty cops that were involved that we caught
yeah
so here's what happened on that
i had calls from numerous senators and numerous congressmen and women, saying it was the greatest presentation they've ever had
mike and rand paul disagreed because they want information that, honestly, i think is very hard to get
it's okay if the military wants to give it, but they didn't want to give it
and it really had to do with sources and information that we had that really should remain at a very high level
could we individually maybe give one or two of them some information
possibly, if we can do that
i get along great with mike lee
i've never seen him like that
but other people have called and they've said it was the best presentation they've ever seen
and let me tell you what was the best, forget about presentation
the result
we killed a man who killed many, many americans and many, many people   thousands and thousands of people
and when i go over to walter reed and i meet these young, incredible folks   mostly, it just seems mostly men, but also women   where their legs are gone, their arms are gone
in some cases, both the legs and the arms are gone, and the face and the body is badly damaged
and frankly, five years ago, they couldn't have lived
and today, they can live because of the wonders of medicine and the wonders of walter reed and the people that, over there   what   the job they do, the medical doctors
but i will say this
we caught a total monster, and we took him out
and that should have happened a long time ago
thank you very much, vice president mike pence
great job you're doing, and hello toledo
we love toledo
you remember i was here a lot
you remember 2016, what a year that was, right
and 2020 is going to be even better, no doubt
but i'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of ohio
and as we begin the new year, our economy is booming, wages are soaring, workers are thriving, and america's future has never ever looked brighter, never
with the envy of every country in the world, we've created 7 million brand new jobs since our election, and we will soon be replacing the disaster known as nafta, with the incredible brand new usmca
the historic victory for ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, but really, a great victory for the united states
it's an incredible agreement
you remember, i came and i'd talked about it
i'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are
we did a brand new one with korea
so now, we have south korea
we just finished a big one, $40 billion with japan
on january 15th, we're signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, $40 to $50 billion to our farmers
that's   our farmers will take it in
i keep saying, go buy larger tractors
go buy larger tractors
i said this, no way
i don't know if you know the story
my people wanted $20 billion of purchase, right
$20 billion, $20 billion, that's a lot of money
it's a lot of corn, $20 billion, and i said, make it $50 billion
china's very big and they said, ok
they said, sure the farmers can't produce that much
i said, let the farmers tell me that
tell them to go out, remember
and buy a bigger what
tractor
buy a bigger tractor
the old producer
so, $40 billion to $50 billion of agricultural product and the manufacturers and the car companies, and we've brought a lot of car companies into ohio, you know that
a lot of them coming in, a lot of them have already been brought in
they're coming in from japan
they're coming in from all over the world
this is where they want to be
they want to be in the united states
that's where the action is
they're all coming back
i used to go around talking about how everyone's leaving
they were all leaving
a lot of you are victims of that leaving
these companies would leave
they'd go to mexico
they'd go to canada
they'd close up, they'd buy from china
now, they're all coming back, new ones, old ones, they're all coming back, and many are coming right here to ohio
and just in case you didn't know it, ohio just had the best year, economically, in the history of your state
that's not bad, that's not bad, and this year's going to be even better and maybe much better
but weeks ago, i signed the largest ever investment in the united states military, $738 billion, and we created the sixth branch of the united states armed forces, the space force, and everybody's excited about that
after years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the united states military
some of it's still coming in
we have everything
we've got new planes, we've got new rockets, missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, $2
5 trillion in new investments
our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before
and if you remember three years ago, when i took over, we were depleted, our military was totally depleted
and by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with choice, choice with choice, that was a big thing
you know, i used to go around and the va was a terrible situation
people would wait weeks   he's right, he said, yes, it was right
you don't hear too much about that anymore
do you notice
choice and accountability
do you know what accountability is
for 44 years, they tried to get accountability
that's somebody bad, works for the va, you couldn't fire them, you couldn't fire them
they could be sadistic
they could be thieves
they could be whatever they were
you couldn't get rid of them
we got accountability approved, and now we say, you're fired, get out
we get somebody and that's good
44 years, and maybe most importantly of all, is choice
va veterans choice
so now, you wait in line and a lot of times you'd be waiting in line for four or five or six weeks, you couldn't see a doctor
now you have to wait
you go out to a private doctor, you get yourself taken care of, we pay the bill
what a difference it's made
what a difference it's made
you know, when i was a little bit newer to this game     that's ok
that's ok
they got it
they got it
they go home to mommy, going home to mommy
they're going home to mommy
it's a beautiful sight
thank you, security
do we love law enforcement, by the way
so with the va, i used to go around say why don't they do that
why don't these people   why don't they go to a private doctor to work something out
and i thought it was a brilliant plan
i said i'm telling you
i am such a smart guy
i said this is the most brilliant thing ever and i went back to my people and i said, you know, i have an idea
if veterans are sick, they can't get the kind of service they need or they need a certain kind of a doctor
i have an idea
it's such a great idea
you're going to go out private
you're going to pick up a doctor
you're going to get yourself fixed up
we're going to pay the bill, right
and you know what happened
and i said how, how brilliant is that
they say, sir, we've been working on that for 48 years, but we've never been able to get it approved
i was very, very disillusioned
but you know what i'm good at
getting things approved and we got it approved
so, we signed that 11 months ago and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health
people would wait online for weeks and some people weren't very sick, and then, end up being terminally ill
they couldn't get to see a doctor
now they go out, they get a doctor, we take care of them
we take care of our vets
so, we're using this great power, not to pursue conflict, but to really preserve   and i mean, in the truest sense of the word, preserve peace
we have this tremendous military and you know what that is
that is really a great fighting force, but i hope we never have to use it
i really do
you saw an example
you saw an example of that a couple of days ago
so, we seek friends, not enemies
but if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril
we've never had   we've never had a military
what we have now, we've never had anything like it
you know, we were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50-, 60-year old planes
you've heard this story
the grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them
those are all gone now, folks
those are all gone
in october of last year, u
special operations forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the blood-thirsty founder and leader of isis
the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and the entire isis caliphate is destroyed, and his terrorist empire, and he was indeed a monster, has been totally demolished
we killed thousands and thousands of isis warriors fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up, where they should be
nobody has ever done what we've done in three years
and i'll say this, when we took it over, it was a mess
we did it in a short period of time, but when we took it over, it was not good
and last week, the united states once again took the bold and decisive action to save american lives and deliver american justice, and you know what i'm talking about
for years, these sadistic mass murderer, qasem soleimani, planned and executed attacks against american targets, killing and wounding thousands of u
service members, and many, many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of other people
as the leader of iran's terrorist quds force, soleimani spread death, destruction, and mayhem across the middle east and far beyond
he ordered the violent assault on the american embassy in baghdad, and you saw   this was the anti-benghazi
we got there very quickly
we got there very quickly
this is the exact opposite
we did it exactly the opposite of benghazi, where they got there so late
all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from days before
it's all they saw
we got there very early
we saw what was happening
i saw what was happening
i said what's that all about
and that was going to be another benghazi had they broken through the final panels of glass
they were breaking it, breaking it
had they gotten through, we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages
that wasn't going to happen and i called up our great generals
i said, get them over there now
and one of our leaders, one of our really admired people said, sir, we'll have them there tomorrow
i said, no, get in the planes right now
have them there immediately and they got there immediately
fortunately
but he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four american service members, badly wounded, and killed an american citizen that was just before we happened to hit him
soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in baghdad, but we stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold
so at my direction, the united states military eliminated qasem soleimani and ended his rampage through, not only that part of the world but much bigger parts of the world
he was all over
he was a bad guy
he was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror
he's dead
and yet now, i see the radical left democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist
and you know instead, they should be outraged by soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long
you know, he was the king of the roadside bomb
do you know what the roadside bomb
and then, they got bigger and he'd send them over to afghanistan and iraq
and when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs or without an arm, and with so much damage, it's most likely that he caused that damage, because that's what he liked
he loved planting the roadside bomb
so now, he's gone and that's a good thing
bernie sanders, crazy bernie  has condemned the u
military strike on soleimani, the world's top terrorist, think of it, the world's top terrorist, and we're having people like nancy pelosi
it's a real genius
do you believe that one
nancy, nancy, nervous nancy, but here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military, whoever was in his way
and we have bernie and nancy pelosi, we have them all
they're all trying to say, how dare you take him out that way
you should get permission from congress
you should come in and tell us what you want to do
you should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news, that's back there and we can leak it
that's a lot of   that's a lot of corruption back there, folks
no, no, but think, seriously
so they want me   so you know, these are split-second decisions
you have to make a decision
so, they don't want me to make that decision
they want me to call up, maybe go over there
let me go over to congress
come on over to the white house, let's talk about it
when can you make it
well, i won't be able to make it today, sir, how about let's say, a couple of days
oh, sure, come on over
now, we got a call
we heard where he was, we knew the way he was getting there, and we had to make a decision
we didn't have time to call up nancy, who is not operating with a full deck
now, they want us to call
can you imagine calling crooked adam schiff
he's so crooked
he's so crooked
shifty schiff, say, gee adam, how are you doing
listen, we have the world's no
1 terrorist, killed thousands and thousands of people
we'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution
would you be willing to meet
well, i won't be able to make it this week
well, you know, he's traveling fast
we got to get lined up, adam, you little pencil neck, nine inches
he buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it's loose
now, come on adam, we got to meet faster, adam
we got him lined up
we got to take this guy out, we're not going to have another shot at a baby ever again
but, but i can't make it now because i'm trying to impeach trump
i'm trying to impeach   even though he did nothing wrong
by the way, did you see
i did nothing wrong
they don't even know what the hell is going on
in fact, it's so weak
she doesn't want to put in the articles, it's so weak
they're, so pathetic
they're so pathetic
so, they want us to call them
now, schiff is a big leaker
you know, he leaks to crazy cnn, see, with a little red light on
not too many people are watching cnn, but he leaks
so, he'll say it, you know, off the record, i got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway of my cellphone
off the record, they've got the no
1 terrorist in the world, soleimani, and they're going to get him
they're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes
please don't tell anybody i told you, but so we have   we have breaking news, president trump within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking a terrorist, general soleimani
he's going to do it and it should be happening about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17
then, we get back to the battlefield
how do you do, fellas
i don't know, sir
he disappeared
i don't know what happened to him
they want us to   they want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media
you got to say, though, that's a lot of media, right
that's the way the academy awards used to look when it was successful
then, they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful
i love it
i love it, actually
oh, they have some bad ones here tonight
they have some really bad ones, some real sick ones
then, one good one, by the way, one good one
they have one good one, but some bad ones, very, very dishonest people, and we have some great ones too
you know, we have some great journalists, great reporters, but you've got a tremendous number of dishonest media people, like, i have never seen in my life before
they write things that they know are wrong
they write   if you watched for the last three years, think of it, and then, they get pulitzer prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong
how do you do that
they get pulitzer prizes for being wrong
the pulitzer prize doesn't mean a thing, doesn't mean a thing
i mean, i'm going to tell you about the nobel peace prize
i'll tell you about that
i made a deal
i saved a country, and i just heard that the head of that country is now getting the nobel peace prize for saving the country
i said, what   did i have something to do with it
yeah, but you know that's the way it is
as long as we know, that's all that matters, ok
i saved a big war, saved a couple of them, but under my administration, we will never make excuses for america's enemies
we will never hesitate in defending american lives, and we will never stop working to defeat radical islamic terrorism, never
and nobody's done it like we've done it
and it's we, it's we, it's not me
it's we, it's a whole movement
there has, by the way, never been a movement like this
you know outside, i don't know what this place holds, like, 10,000 - 11,000 people, right
outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in
there's never been a movement like this
there's never been a movement like this
and i'll tell you, maybe, i'm wrong, but this is bigger than it was in 2016 because because in 2016, i said what we're going to do
but now, i've completed more promises than i've made
i mean, i've actually completed more than i've made, right
like, as an example, many of you are here   look at all those beautiful red hats, keep america great, that's good
but i never talked about   did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about space force
we never talked about it
we did space force, but did we ever speak about it
no, there were many things that we've done that we never spoke about, right
right to try
you know about right to try, right
they've been trying to get it for 44 years, right to try
that's people that are very sick, terminally ill, and they can't get medicine that possibly works and very well
we have the greatest labs, the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest scientists in the world with the greatest medicines in the world
if they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work, but is going to take another six years   i brought those times way back, by the way, way down, but they would travel to asia, they would travel to europe, they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick
i said wait a minute, they're going to die
they're going to die
well, sir, we can't take the liability
i said then, we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability, taking all liability away from the country, away from the insurance companies, away from the healthcare companies, away from the doctors, and with the great help of a lot of incredible republicans and we had some democrats help us, we passed right to try, and you have to see how this has worked
some people are, being   many, people are being saved
and you know, the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick because they didn't want it on their charts
i said i understand that
then we won't include that
we'll have a separate list over here
they said, oh, would you do that
i said, yeah, i'll do that, right
i'll do that, but i didn't talk about right to try
i never said i was going to get that done or we got it done
that was a tough one to get done
sounds simple
it was tough
there's nothing easy in this country
you know, they said to me, a friend of mine, the other day, who is the toughest country to deal with, president
he used to call me donald
i've known this guy for a long time
i like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that
i just don't want to tell you how long, it's too long
and i say, call me, donald, you've always called me donald
i can't
he calls me, mr
president, i've known this guy forever
he used to call me, hey don, let's go out to dinner
you know, before he'd go, hey, let's go out to dinner
now, he goes, mr
president, sir, how are you, right
how are you
but what we've done, and he said, he called me   he said what you've done, he's never seen anything like it
so many people are saying that
we are all together doing something, not only in terms of the election, not only in terms of what we're doing right now
don't forget, it's a long way to the election
you know, we have what, 10 months
that's a long way
this is my first stop of the year
first major stop of the year
this is it and we start, by the way, let's do one of those polls right now
do you mind
but is there anything more fun than a trump rally
here we are
is there anything more   ready
so, we have the greatest phrase of all time, make america great again, and in all due respect, i'll never end   i'm a little superstitious
i'll never end it, make america great again
but i see all those hats, i see all those hats, changing it a little bit, but make america great again
and i said, you know today, we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country
so, your 401ks are at records, your stocks are great, but what it really means to me is jobs, more importantly, than anything else
we have the best jobs, the best everything, right
but we just hit   so, i can't really say, make america great again
our military is rebuilt, $2
5 trillion, our military is rebuilt, we're doing great numbers, economically, our country is the strongest it's ever been
you have factories moving back into ohio
you never saw anything like it, right
you had your best year
so, when i say, make america great again, what that sort of means is, like, we didn't get there, but we did get there
so now, i have a new theme, it's called keep america great
keep america, right
now, i'm a very loyal person and i am concerned about changing the theme because make america great again because i think it was the greatest political campaign in history
i mean, crooked hillary spent    three or four times more money than us, right
so, crooked hillary, wait, crooked   you should lock her up, i'll tell you
crooked hillary spent three or four times more
so, i want to be a little bit
you know, i have to say that was a great campaign and i don't want to change it
i don't want to have this incredible 2016, then go with something, and if something ever happened, oh, this country will go to hell
oh, i hate to see   you know the stocks, i'm talking about records
you'll have records this way, you're going to have records, get used to it
because if that happened, you will see things happen that aren't good
but i have to now say, do i want to change the greatest theme in political history
make america great again with keep america great, right
so, so, let's take a little applause, right
we'll go make america great again, you'd clap if you want that
then we would go, keep america great, you'd clap if you like that, ok, are you ready
first, make america great again
ready
keep america great
so, you know that   i call that a free poll   that's better than a poll
do you ever see these crazy polls that come out
we're doing great in the polls, by the way
remember i used to come out and talk about the polls
we'll start doing that very soon
we're doing great in the polls, but this is like a free poll
somebody else would go out, they have all this money that they raised and they give somebody $1 million, and they'll ask 200 people that question
and then, they'll say, well, make america great again is better
but i will tell you, i haven't heard one thing with that was true
with all of these, i would have, i would have said instinctively, make america great again, could not be beaten
i've probably done this ten times
i have never had it win, it's keep america great, and that's what we're doing, but we're going to use both
we're going to use both
we're going to use both because there's no way that i'm going to jettison make america great, right
there's no way
we're going to use both, but this hat is a hot seller
we're selling that hat like nobody's ever sold the hat before, i will say
oh, it's great, good
keep america great
so, we're going to use both, but keep america great
that's probably going to be the dominant theme
for eight years, the obama administration enabled and emboldened  the iranian regime
they gave iran $150 billion, including $1
7 billion in hard cold cash
can you imagine
no, no, can you imagine $1
7 billion, $1
8 billion in cash
so, the foolish iran nuclear deal financed iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout, that's what it did
and by the way, it expires so soon
they can have nuclear weapons
they're not, as i said before, they will not have nuclear weapons
by subsidizing iran's malign conduct, the last administration was leading the world down the path of war
we are restoring our world to the path of peace, peace through strength, peace through strength, and our country is doing great, and i think, something is going to happen that's got to be good
you know, we've sanctioned the hell out of iran and we just put more yesterday
they hit us with 16 missiles, and i said, how many
we were ready to go, we were ready to go
i said how many, how many died
how many were wounded
sir, none
none
pretty good warning system, none
how many were hurt
how were hurt
none, sir
so, we didn't do anything
we were ready
we were ready, not that i wanted to, but we were ready, you have no idea
a lot of people got very lucky
we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great republican leaders, a man who has helped me right from the beginning, a very special guy, representative bill johnson, bill
where is bill
thank you, bill
thank you, bill
great job, great job and his fellow friends, jim jordan,
we have a lot of your congressmen, right now in congress, they said, sir, should we come with you
i said, no, stay back and vote
they're voting on some pretty important stuff, right
but we were able to get bill
we thank you, bill, very much, great job, great warrior
thank you, bill
ohio lieutenant governor, jon husted
thank you, jon
thank you, jon
thank you, jon
great job
state treasurer, robert sprague
thank you, robert, and you have a lot more money in the bank right now, robert, as treasurer, right, than you ever did
ohio supreme court justice, judy french
thank you, judy
great job
state senate president, a man highly respected, larry obhof
thank you, larry
and a woman who really has become a great friend of mine
she took over this party
we fought like hell
we had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party, but they'd never had a chance against jane timken, jane
and the man who is in charge of my campaign in ohio, i had a choice of five people
i said i like this guy's name
i don't know why his name is bob paduchik
why do i like his name
and i said bob, how are we doing
he said you're going to win big, sir
because you know, you keep hearing, you cannot win unless you win the great state of ohio, that's these guys, and once i was leading ohio by a lot in the poll, they never said that anymore
it's terrible
they were saying it when they thought i wasn't going to win, but we were ahead right from the beginning
but bob was   incredibly did a fantastic job and bob, i'd call him up
i'd say, bob, we don't have the governor, we don't have the head of the republican party, you know, it's a minor problem, you're running as a republican, and he punked out on us, right, this guy
we don't have any
he said, sir, you have the people
i said, well, what happens   he was  i said so bob, let me ask you just out of curiosity, i don't have these people, the leaders are not with us
is that good or bad
he said, sir, it's great
you just went up three points
would you believe this by not having it
and he said, don't worry, sir, you're going to win, and we won by a lot
and now, i understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible
but bob was fantastic
thank you, bob
and thanks to republican leadership work, can you believe this
i have a 95% approval rating
can you believe this
and do you know who second is
we do, we do, we do
do you know who second is
ronald reagan at 87%, ronald reagan
and then, one of these characters back there, they put me in a contest with the late great abraham lincoln, right
so, who do you like better, trump or abraham lincoln
i said abraham lincoln,  so i said, who do you like better
they say they did a poll on this
i think i remember the numbers
all i know is, we won against abraham, honest abe
we won 53 to 47
do you believe that, abraham lincoln
i went back to the first lady, i said first lady, i just beat abraham lincoln in a poll
i don't know if they had polls back there, but abraham lincoln
i always say i can be more presidential than any candidate that ever ran than any president, other than maybe, abraham lincoln when he's wearing his hat
but i like abe lincoln, but we're doing well
we have a lot of support
do you know why
because our country is doing so well, our country is doing so well
and when we went out, we started and we went right to the top of the polls
it wasn't like these folks today
they are 2%, 3%, but they're claiming
we went right to the top from day one
we never missed center stage in the debates
remember those great debates
we actually got high ratings
they don't get very good ratings anymore
they're like, it's like death, watching, i should watch
you know, i'm supposed to watch
it's like my job
try and watch, watch the competition, but it's like watching death
those debates are boring
they're boring
you got to sit through those things for two or three hours
you got to really be committed to the country to do that
i mean, you have some real beauties
do you see where pocahontas is slipping badly
and bernie, bernie has gone up
he's surging, bernie's, crazy bernie, he's surging, and biden doesn't know the difference between iran and iraq
he's gotten it wrong around four times
he goes when we took our shot at iraq
no, no, no, they all say no, no, they're screaming
it's iran, iran
ah, what, what
and his son, right
where's hunter, where's hunter
no, i went to one of them
i said, we have to have where's hunter as a witness
they said, what do you mean where's hunter
i said that's his first name
i have now made his first name where's, where's hunter
here's a guy made no money, got thrown out of the military forces
i think the navy, got thrown out, had no job, had no nothing, so, he went from that to making millions of dollars a year, as soon as, sleepy joe became vice president, right
he made millions of dollars a year
would anybody in this room do that for millions of   i would
we all would
he made millions and millions of dollars a year
ukraine took care of him
how about china
he walked out with $1
5 billion to manage, and he never did it before
he didn't know anything about oil and gas
he was making a fortune
so, where's hunter
where the hell are you hunter
but i'll tell you, i sort of hope, it's joe because he will hear where's hunter every single debate, nine times a debate
where's hunter
and then, you have buttigieg, buttigieg, boot, edge, edge
i, i can't   nobody, nobody can pronounce
nobody has any idea how the hell to say his name
so, what they do is they call him, mayor pete
you know, like mayor pete
here comes mayor pete, doesn't do a very good job
alfred e
neuman, you're right, howdy doody
some people say, howdy doody, howdy doody
the problem is a lot of people don't remember alfred e
neuman, don't say that, you look much younger than that i must say
so, you have mayor pete
i mean give me a break
can you believe mayor pete
this is going to be the president of the united states
this is going to be   how would he be against negotiating against president xi of china
and we just made one hell of a deal
you're going to see the numbers very soon, you know
one hell of a deal
they didn't like those tariffs
thanks to republican leadership, america is winning again and america, most importantly, is respected again, respected like never before
and you know for years, nato has taken advantage of the united states
we protect europe from russia and the numbers have been going down for many, many years, 15 years, 18 years
the numbers is like a roller coaster down and i went over, and i said folks, you got to pay your bills, you're delinquent, you know, you're delinquent
and then, they don't like me
they say we like obama better
they should like obama better
obama would go in and say, thank you very much for coming
i appreciate it
bye-bye
i'm going back to washington
i'm going back
i'll be violating the carbon footprint
i'm going to hawaii to play golf
i drive to play a round of golf and the course i own doesn't even cost them anything
he flies to hawaii, nobody cares
if i drive 20 minutes, it's like donald trump is playing golf today
he violates the carbon footprint, but, but just think of it, think of it, think of where we've come
think of where we've come
a great congressman from tennessee, they have   it's a great state
they have early voting, very early voting, probably the earliest, and he said i don't know
i just left
i just left tennessee
this was in november
this was the election 2016
he said i just left this incredible state of mine
i love that state
sir, we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before because they never were inspired to vote, and these are people that never voted, and they had had so in trump
they have pins on trump, trump, trump, and trump
they have the bans on, you know, like a miss universe
it says, trump-pence and they've got buttons all over it
they've got shirts, saying trump and trump-pence
i never saw anything like it
if every state is like tennessee, sir, i hate to tell you, you're going to have one hell of a victory and that's what happened, right
that's happened and you did it
you did it and i think we're going to have bigger numbers, even bigger numbers because i'll tell you what
we're a long way from the election
i think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time
i really do
you know, elizabeth warren sadly referred to, she of great indian heritage
remember, i used to say, i have more indian blood in me than she has and i have none
i turned out to be right, but you look at what she's doing, you look at what she's saying, the lies, the deceit, the fraud, you see it all
we are going to do so great
it's got to be something that's going to be special
it's going to be for the record books
the evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors, ministers, preachers, and they just called today
five of the most respected people and they said things that were incredible
they said, there's never been anything like this in the church that they can read
some of them have been doing it for 30, 40 years
they said we have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this president and for this presidency, all of us like we have right now
and the great franklin graham, billy graham's son, franklin graham, a fantastic man
he said two weeks ago, my father, billy graham voted for donald trump
he   nobody ever
no, no, no, he never said that before
billy graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say, he voted   franklin graham said billy graham, may be the greatest of all, maybe the greatest of all time
he said my father, billy graham, who is very old at the time and in trouble, he was in trouble, he was not well
he voted for donald trump
what a great tribute that was to me
what a great tribute, great family
unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years, african-american, hispanic-american, and asian-american unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever, ever, ever recorded
wages are rising fast, they're going up very fast, and the biggest percentage increase makes me happy, are for blue-collar workers, 40 million
think of this, 40 million american families are now benefiting from the republican child-tax credit, each receiving an average of over $2,200 a year
now america lost
this is hard to believe because if you think how could it possibly be true, but this is what happened
probably, it's the reason, number one reason i'm running, america lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000
you wouldn't believe that's possible, but i know it's true because i've said it 50 times and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me
no, it's true
well thank you, rush, very much
well this should have been done for the last 15 to 20 years
him in particular
he was there a real military leader
he's a terrorist
he was designated a terrorist by president obama and then obama did nothing about it except give them $150 billion and even more incredibly $1
8 billion in cash
you hear me talking about that all the time and you talk about it all the time
he gave me all this money
he never wanted to do anything about it
president bush should have taken him out
he is responsible for the ieds
that was the roadside bombs and bombs that blow up all over the place and then the sister, which is the big one, the big version that actually knocked out tanks and kills everybody within   within earshot
a really horrible weapon
he's responsible for all those incredible young people over at walter reed, where they do such a great job, by the way
and when they lose their arms and their legs, oh no, he gave so much of that technology, much of that stuff was made in iran, and he should have been taken out a long time ago and we had a shot at it and we took him out and we're a lot safer now because of it
now we'll see what happens, we'll see what the responsive is, if any, but you've seen what i said our response will be
our country is a lot safer, rush
i don't think they had a purpose
i don't think they knew what was happening
why does it give them $150 billion much of it going back into terror and you look at what's happening
when i   they tried to do with appeasement and i can tell you the logan act, if there was ever an act that should have been used, they should look at the obama administration and john kerry, the logan act, because what he was doing with iran and the relationship that they built up and the things that he said i would certainly love to see that be looked at because i think john kerry was, personally, i think he was advising them
i think that the obama administration was   was just letting them get away with murder in the true sense murder, and you know right after they made the deal it wasn't like they were respected
they treated the united states worse than ever before
in fact, i said at least give him a little respect because they treated   they got worse they actually got more hostile
they took 150 billion and they took the 1
8 billion in cash and they got worse
and if you remember right before the payment was made
they took 10 sailors and they humiliated those sailors and they humiliated our country with the sailors down on their knees
and the other reason they released them was they wanted their first payment
it was just before the payment if they had taken them after they got the money they would have never released them
they'd be there now
well they wouldn't be there now with me but they would be there for a long period of time
but you remember the 10 sailors that were
fifteen feet across that line, probably they weren't they don't even know if they were in iranian waters but they said they were slightly in iranian waters so they humiliated them
but they released them because the money was due the following day
and they said, well we don't want to
hey, why should they turn down 150 billion over the 10 sailors
but they humiliated those sailors and our country
right
right
well that's right
and one of the things that changed
i know you talk about it
if you go back 10 years or eight years or maybe even five years, israel was the king of the congress, right
our congress protected israel and fought for israel
now you look at the way the democrats in congress are treating, where you have aoc and you have tlaib and you have omar and they are actually, you know, anti-semitic they are totally against israel to things that they've said you go back to the past and you look at the things that they've said about israel and jewish people
it's incredible
ten years ago that would have been unaccepted it would have been   it would have been   nobody could have even believed it
i still can't believe it
you know i'm a little bit old fashioned, right, in that sense because i've grown up and there was always great protection and reverence for israel and now it's the opposite
in the democrats, it's almost it's almost a negative
they're going out and what they do for tlaib and what they do for omar, representative omar, minnesota, and aoc, i think it's incredible the way they talk about israel
it just was unthinkable to do that 10 years ago and sooner
well you know politics has changed a lot over the last couple of years
for instance, i want low taxes, they want to raise your taxes
how do you think that works
i couldn't win as a politician
i don't think abe lincoln could win as a politician
borders, they want open borders
when you see the people that we're sending back and we're capturing now at record levels, these are, in many cases, they're murderers and they're people that drug dealers and it's incredible
they want open borders
that means all of these people are going to be pouring in
and of course good ones will come in too but you have tremendous numbers of really bad people including murderers and rapists and others
they want open borders
they want sanctuary cities
they don't want a strong military based on everything
i mean, we have to fight like crazy to get the strong military
and we have to give up things that we wouldn't give up if we had the house, as an example, if we were able to have enough
you know we've always needed their vote because it was always very close
in fact, the first two years we had a very tiny majority
so we always needed their votes
but when you see they want higher taxes, right
they want   they want much more regulation
you know cut regulations more than any president in history by far
even though they were there for four and eight years and in one case more than that, we've got the all-time record, that was probably as important or more important as the tax cuts, the biggest, including ronald reagan, the biggest tax cut we've ever had and we're actually taking in more revenue now than we did when we had the higher taxes because the economy's doing so well
but you know when you see them with open borders, rush, you say   and sanctuary cities and all of these other things you say, where are they coming from
well israel is sort of the same
i put that in that same category
they're   they're as far as i'm concerned they're anti-israel, totally anti-israel
it's amazing
like as an example take   take the wall
they were always for the wall and then i wanted it and they went against it
in fact, i said if i had it to do again i would have come out totally against the wall and i would have gotten their votes
all i had to do is come out against the wall
i am opposed to building the wall and we would have gotten all the votes we needed
now it's almost like they'll try and do whatever is the opposite
i think they've lost their minds
you want to know the truth
i really do
it's a terrible thing to say
nobody's ever seen anything like it
like even the impeachment hoax, you take a look at that and they have nothing
they have nothing
with one of the biggest investigations in history they found nothing, the mueller report, they found absolutely   think of it
they spent $45 million, two years to hoax
they spent all of that time, all of that money, had brilliant people that happened to be, you know, very, very   they were crazed
they were crazed
i mean, these people were dying to find something on trump
they found nothing
i think there's very few people that you've ever met who could have had that
they had so many investigators, they were calling people that i haven't seen in years and they got nothing
think of that
nothing
very few people, and by the way, i'm sure they looked at my taxes
they looked at everything you had to look at
they looked at everything and $45 million and much more than that in the true sense
you know, in the real sense, it was much more than that, and they had 18
i used to call them 13 angry democrats but they increased it to 18 angry democrats
that's smart
and very smart, many were tied up with clinton
they were involved with clinton but these people couldn't find any
they found nothing
even i was very impressed with how clean i am, rush
well i think what they're trying to do is affect the election illegally but that's what they're trying to do
but the reason that i said it because they're   they are a joke
they are not crimes
there is nothing there
they found nothing
we went through two years of a muller report
you know that better than anybody
nobody covered it better
and we went through to you
yeah
it's so sad for our country
i mean, think of it, we're fighting with iran
we're fighting with all of these different places and in many cases doing great, making trade deals and doing so good, our country is doing so good
but i have to spend and my team has to spend time on this stuff
they found nothing
just think of that for two years
and   and unlimited budget, unlimited talent and they found nothing
and they come up with two   two articles that aren't even a crime
they created a situation that was false, that was fraudulent, and then they investigated the false-fraudulent situation and they found nothing
it's hard to believe the whole thing's are to blame
and now on top of it they come up with two articles and they put it before
now, what happened is she doesn't want to get a vote because, how could anybody possibly, it's totally partisan
you know this was not what they had in mind as they call them the founders, right
they keep saying the founders, founders
but the founders didn't have this in mind
you understand
it's like i've never heard the word founders so much in my life
yeah
you know we got a hundred, i guess, 196 or 197 to nothing with the republican party, plus we have three democrat votes, and one person actually left the democratic   the democrat party over it and joined the republican party as you know
never
it's never   i   they say maybe never
and one thing i gave the democrats credit for, they've always been very vicious and that's not necessarily a good thing
but what is a good thing is they always stuck together
and here, the republicans stuck together even better than the democrats
so we had like 196 or 197 to nothing
it's unheard of
you know that because they're always   always break it off and i don't know
and this is really for 70 years, 80 years
you know for some reason it's in the dna
they just don't seem
and in this case they have been so good
and i think they said it will be the same way because the senate knows it's a hoax
everybody knows it's a hoax
well, i just think it's a party of common sense
you know i view it   somebody said, are you conserve   , well, i'm conservative
but i think it's common sense
it was   like what we did this   this two days ago with this horrible terrorists
he was a terrorist
you know they don't want to call him a terrorist
now the democrats are trying to make him sound like it was this wonderful human being
well, when you read the new york times, you read the washington post, that are totally fake newspapers by the way, that would have both been out of business except i won
i wonder what happens and hopefully in five years, right, hopefully in five years
but i wonder what happens to those newspapers
who knows
but they do well now
although if you look at the unfunded liability, probably, they don't do so well
but you look at what they write
it's so fake, it's so phony and now they're trying to build him just like they did al-baghdadi
al-baghdadi was the number one terrorist in the world
we got him
they wrote very little about it, relatively speaking
that story disappeared very quickly, as you know
but they tried to build him up into a   into a relatively wonderful man
he was a total bad guy
now he founded isis
he was doing it again
he was trying to do it again
you know i wiped out isis by our   during our administration we wiped out the entire caliphate 100% of the caliphate and we wiped him out
and, you know, got little credit but our our people know that we did it, rush, because if people like you and sean hannity and mark levin and so many others
your friends at fox and friends in the morning are so good
you know, people are getting it, they really get it because of social media and my twitter, without twitter, i think, we'd be   we'd be lost
we wouldn't be able to get the truth out
well i wish i didn't have to do it
i wish we had legitimate newspaper and legitimate media
we don't
i mean, it's much of it is   is really, i call it corrupt, it's the corrupt media
and you know it's very internal
you understand this better than anybody
if they do a story in me, i immediately know if it's false or not false so i don't mind a bad story of if it's right
but i know
a person reading the story doesn't know that it's false
so i'm able to tell them through social media
i don't even call it twitter
i call it social media because it goes to everything, you know, goes to facebook, it goes to instagram and we have hundreds of millions of people
you know we have a tremendous amount of people just on one side
i'm up to i guess close to 70 million people
i just had dinner   i had dinner with mark zuckerberg the other day and he said , i'd like to congratulate you
in front of a large group of people so i'm not that   but he said, i'd like to congratulate you
you're no
1 on facebook
and, you know, it's it's incredible
and that's
i did
you have semi-breaking news, i guess a couple of people might have reported it but they're not like you
so i just got a list to tsl power 50, the no
1 show on radio
there's a guy named rush limbaugh
did you ever hear of him
rush limbaugh, no
have you
and this is the 50 most influential and most listened-to streaming talk shows in the country
rush limbaugh, no
so i hope you saw that but now we've just made your interview
but your viewers have to know that, your listeners have to know that
great job
i love 'em
i love 'em
thank you
well, thank you very much, rush
thank you for everything and congratulations on your incredible success
i really   it's so important for this country what you do
thank you very much, rush
well, thank you very much, everyone
king salman of saudi arabia, he just called to express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed and wounded in the attack that took place just recently, just this morning, in pensacola, florida
the king said that the saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter and that this person, in no way, shape, or form represents the feelings of the saudi people who love the american people so much
so that was just given to me by the king of saudi arabia
and i can tell you, it's a horrible thing that took place
and we're getting to the bottom of it
all of the investigators are there now, and they're studying it very closely
and a terrible thing
and our condolences go to the families and to everybody involved, including the wounded
we have some badly wounded people also
and we have to extend our condolences to them, and we'll be working with them all very closely
so i just wanted to let you know that was from king salman
and today, we're here to talk to some of the very hardworking citizens who are benefitting from our historic record-setting campaign to eliminate job-killing regulations
i will tell you, the market is up 325 points today on great job numbers
the numbers have been phenomenal, actually
some people said   so spot on, so good   that they've actually never seen anything like it
and it's a long way from when people were rooting for a recession because they thought they could maybe win an election
but we don't root for a recession
we root for success
and we're having tremendous success
i want to thank vice president mike pence, who's here, right here   mike, thank you   as well as secretary gene scalia, secretary elaine chao, acting omb director russ vought, and acting administrator chris pilkerton
thank you all very much for being here
appreciate it
appreciate it very much
it's been an incredible period of time, economically, for our country
probably the best ever
and we have the best unemployment numbers in over 54 years
we have the best numbers for african americans
this came out today
again, african american, hispanic, asian american   the best numbers we've ever had
numbers for women are at a record number
we think that it will probably   if it keeps going like this   very shortly be totally historic
but they're at numbers that nobody ever believed possible
nobody would have believed it
frankly, in the campaign, i would have never said it, but i felt we were going to do very well
that's despite the fact that we're paying interest to people that have their money in the bank and other countries are not
so they have a great competitive advantage, and yet we're, by far, far and away, the most successful economy anywhere in the world
we're doing better than any other economy in the world
and, you know, we've created many trillions of dollars of wealth since the election
other countries have lost many trillions of dollars
we're, by far, the largest economy in the world, and that was going to change
for many years, they were saying that was going to change, we were going to go to number two during this presidency
that was years ago
and i guess that   the wrong president got elected from the standpoint that there are a lot of people very unhappy about it
so they wish   they certainly think it was the wrong president
they would have rather had somebody else because they're not number one
we're number one
and we're so far ahead that people can't even believe it
so we've had tremendous success
we've had it together
this has been a great group of cabinet members
and the people in the administration have done a really good job
it was just reported that we added another 266,000 jobs in november and we've also had very favorable numbers outside of the 266 , including some of the past numbers have been corrected in a very positive way also
so we have 266,000 jobs, plus we've created 7 million jobs, since my election
unemployment is at the lowest rate, as i told you, in many years
and in many ways, i think we can probably, very soon, say historically
a record 158 million americans are now working
that's the largest number in the history of our country
we've never had 158 million people working
and we should be breaking the 160 million magic mark fairly soon
the stock market today, as you know, it's up 325
we've hit another record high
i believe that's 128 times   something like that   that we've broken the record, the all-time record for stock market highs
and think of that
about 128 times, and we've been here for less than three years
so it's   and that, i can tell you, is a record
5 million americans have been lifted out of poverty
african american, hispanic america, asian american poverties   poverty levels, in the positive sense, have hit record lows
that's something that nobody thought was going to be possible in a short period of time either
so they've all hit record lows
our regulatory reform efforts are delivering prosperity to forgotten men, women, and children of america
we are seeing a middle-class boom led by blue-collar jobs
and that's one of the things that's so great
the blue-collar workers   great workers of our country   they're really benefitting tremendously from what we've done with the tax cuts and all of the other things that we've done
and very big, i think, is the regulation cuts
because even before we were able to get the tax cuts so successfully from congress, we started cutting regulations immediately, and that had a big impact
and that's why we went up so much between the election victory
so you'd say, really, from november 9th, the day after the election, up until january 20th, the inauguration, the stock markets and jobs went   literally, went through the roof
and if the election were lost, it would have gone right through the floor
it would have been a disaster
the soaring stock market is boosting pensions, 401(k)s, and college savings accounts at record levels
we've added $10 trillion in value to the economy, helping the small businesses that create two out of three new jobs
nearly every single state has seen record numbers
almost every state   i can tell you, every state i've been to in the last three months is having the best year they've ever had
and that's because of the federal policy
and they're very thankful
the governors are very thankful
the senators are very thankful
they're all very thankful
so things have happened that nobody thought would be possible
but, literally, every state i go to is setting a record for their state   individual states
and one of the states had just reported, and it's because of our actions, not because of their actions, this i can tell you   because their actions are very negative
california is doing much better than anyone anticipated because of what we've done at the federal level
so, i'm very happy about that
next year, we will continue our bold deregulatory campaign
we'll remove costly burdens to make cars safer and more affordable
i don't know if you know what's going on
we're in a dispute with california
california, in order to save a tiny amount of fuel, of which we have plenty   and we have numbers that nobody would have believed possible
we're the largest energy producer now in the world, and we're an exporter of energy for the first in our history, really
but we can make cars much less expensive, much better, much stronger, and about the same, from an environmental standpoint
very close
but then, when you realize that many old cars will be taken off the road because they don't want to get rid of them because they don't want to buy the new cars because, frankly, they don't work very well
that little   like this
you take that
sometimes, it's about that much gasoline
it's a difference between $3,500, extra computers put on the engines, and all of the other things that you have to do
but the cars are much safer
our cars are much safer
they're much cheaper
they're much better
and the reason they're safer is because they can be heavier because, right now, the cars are made out of papier-mâché
and ours are actually   we allow steel content
and so people are getting very excited about it
we have some good support with the auto companies
the only ones that don't support are the car companies that want to be politically correct
but we'll end up in some litigation with california
but just remember
our cars are safer   and they are much safer, by the way   and they're better
they operate better
and, in every way, we think it's going to be terrific
and we have a lot of support from the car industry
and you're talking about a saving of $3,500 on average, per car
that's a tremendous saving
and one of the other things, from an environmental standpoint, many of the old gas guzzlers are   that are spewing out bad things are going to be coming off the road
cars that are 10 years old and older, people will be going to the new cars because the pricing is better
and the net result of what happens environmentally is a very positive result because a lot of old cars are going to come off the road
and they won't come off the road with the california standard, but they'll come off the road with our standard
so you have a better car for less money, and it will be safer
we'll end the regulatory assault on franchise small businesses, which a lot of the people around the table want to do, because they're very, very strongly affected
we'll provide greater financial freedom and flexibility for u
truckers
the trucking industry has gotten   right, elaine
out of control
you might want to say a few words about that in a minute
but it's gotten out of control
and we're doing other things
the lightbulb
they got rid of the lightbulb that people got used to
the new bulb is many times more expensive
and i hate to say it, it doesn't make you look as good
of course, being a vain person, that's very important to me
it's like a   it gives you an orange look
i don't want an orange look
has anyone noticed that
so we'll have to change those bulbs in at least a couple of rooms where i am in the white house
but we're going back to the   it's a double standard
we have a standard of the new bulbs, and we have the old bulbs
and they're already making the old bulbs
many people were complaining that the new bulbs were much, much more expensive
many times, in some cases, more expensive
and the other thing, they're considered a hazardous waste that, because it's largely a gas technology, when the bulb is disposed of, you're supposed to bring it to a hazardous waste site
i said, how many people do that
no-   nobody does it
and, you know, that's a bad thing
so you probably heard about it
you probably read about it
and you'll be able to buy lightbulbs that actually are better lighting, in the opinion of many   and, i tell you, in my opinion   and for a lot less money
and so we're doing that
but you'll also be able   if you want, you can buy the other bulbs also
and i'll tell you, even the bulb companies are very happy about that
but together, we're defending the american workers
we're using common sense
we have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on   in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it   and you don't get any water
you turn on the faucet
you don't get any water
they take a shower and water comes dripping out
it's dripping out   very quietly dripping out
people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once
they end up using more water
so, epa is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion
you go into a new building or a new house or a new home, and they have standards, oh, you don't get water
you can't wash your hands, practically, there's so little water comes out of the faucet
and the end result is you leave the faucet on and it takes you much longer to wash your hands
you end up using the same amount of water
so we're looking at, very seriously, at opening up the standard
and there may be some areas where we'll go the other route   desert areas
but for the most part, you have many states where they have so much water that it comes down   it's called rain      that they don't know   they don't know what to do with it
so we're going to be opening up that, i believe
and we're looking at changing the standards very soon
and that's a little bit like the lightbulb, where you get a bulb that's better for much less money
we go back   but you have the other alternative
and you'll keep the other alternative with sinks and showers, et cetera, too
but that's been a big problem
so a lot   a lot of the things we do are based on common sense
somebody said, is that a conservative, is it a liberal thing
is it   what is it
what are we doing
i said, it's a commonsense thing
in so many   so many of the things that we do, it's based on common sense, like the car
the car will end up with that net tremendous saving, environmentally, when you think of all the cars, the old cars, that will come off the road
you'll end up with a very   a better car
and you'll end up   environmentally, it will be ultimately much better
so, with that, i'd like to introduce mike pence, our great vice president
and, mike, you might want to saw a few words and, very importantly, go around the table with a couple other people you want to introduce
good
yeah
please
yes
yeah, go ahead
right
now, did you write those regulations down
did you think they're   i assume you think they're unnecessary
because some regulation is needed
do you know the ones that barb is talking about
is that right
and if we can do it, you do it
okay
good
thank you, barb, very much
thank you
thank you, ryan
good job you're doing
i've heard some good things
great
thank you very much
great
that's right
sure
it's too much
i agree
that's great
yeah, thank you very much
good job
good job you're doing
you know, we have a lot of things that we're working on
one of them is   to build a road can take 22 years to get approvals
and we've got it way down now
we had   we have roads where they've been going for many, many   they've been going for decades
elaine knows this better than anybody
and at the end of 20 years
right
at the end of 20 years, you're literally   you go for a vote, and you get turned down
so they've been trying to get an approval for 20 years, and then they get turned down, like 3-2 or something
and we've got that process down to four and a half years
it's going to be   i think it's going to be two years
we're going to try and get it down to almost one year
that doesn't mean a road or a highway doesn't get approved
but if they don't get approved, it goes quickly, so they get rejected quickly
but they also, mostly, will get approved quickly
and elaine is doing a fantastic job in bringing that down
we've had so many   so many examples of roads that took 17, 18, 19 years to get approved
and by the time they get approved, they cost 50 times more and they have to do all sorts of turns to get out of certain areas, from an environmental standpoint, instead of being a straight and much safer road
so we've been able to do that
and i think those people in the steel industry have been greatly helped by the tariffs, because the tariffs made the steel industry   it's incredible what's happening   the money that is being spent on steel today
i don't think we would have had a steel industry
if i   if i didn't get elected, you wouldn't have a steel industry, because, ultimately, every steel mill was closing
they were dumping steel at a level that nobody has ever seen before
and they were dumping it in order to, really, destroy our steel industry so that we had to buy from them
and now the steel industry   if you look at what's going on, the industry is doing incredibly well
they're building a lot of extensions
they're building brand-new plants where they never   you know this, russell   they never built a new plant
i mean, they hadn't built one in years, and now they're building new plants all over the country
they're expanding existing plants all over the country
and the steel industry is doing great
and it will start doing even better with what we're doing
so it's been very exciting, especially since the economy is now even stronger than at the beginning
and i think what i'd like to do is ask larry kudlow   the great larry kudlow   to say a few words
the numbers came out today   the job numbers and
well, thank you very much
it's a great honor to be with secretary general stoltenberg of nato
this is our first meeting, meaning my first meeting of this trip
but we've met many times
i think he's doing a fantastic job
i'm a big fan
his contract was extended
i was very happy about that
but you really are   you're doing a fantastic job
we appreciate it
i think the secretary general will tell you that, through some work and some negotiation, we've increased the budget of countries other than the usa, because we're paying far more than anybody else, and far more even as a percentage of gdp
but we've increased the numbers that other countries are paying, by $130 billion
it was going down for close to 20 years
if you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up
and that was going on for a long time
you wouldn't have had a nato if you kept going that way
and now we've really increased it incredibly well, and i'm happy to have helped
but the secretary has been looking to do that for a long time
and, i can tell you, he's very happy about it
and, just generally, we're going to have a very big couple of days
i believe we're going to have a tremendous couple of days, but very big, very important
we have tremendous spirit, as it pertains to nato, i would say   except, perhaps, for one country
and we'll be talking to that one country
we'll see how it works out
and, actually, the one country has a couple of points, but those points are very devastating to nato
but we'll find out about that during the next two days
and, with that, i'd like to introduce the secretary general
say a few words
please
i loved your statement that we're able to change when the world is changing
and you do have to do that
your original mission was somewhat different than it is now
today, the world is a lot different than it was back then
but that's a very profound statement, and it's a statement that everybody has to understand
it's very   to me, it's very important
okay
thank you very much, everybody
yes
i have no thoughts on it
it's going to be a very important election for this great country
but i have no thoughts on it
i will be meeting with him, yes
i don't know
i have the schedule over here
i have   i have many meetings
i have meetings set up with lots of different countries
who said that
i know
and then, turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead, which was interesting
now, nato serves a great purpose
it got to be unfair for the united states because the united states was paying a disproportionate amount
and i heard that president macron said nato is brain dead
i think that's very insulting to a lot of different forces, including the man that does a very good job in running nato
no, it has a great purpose, especially with the fact that nato is becoming much more flexible, in terms of what it looks at
but i was very surprised
i'd like to ask you
what did you think
he made a statement about nato being brain dead
what did you think
it's a tough statement, though, when you make a statement like that
that is a very   a very, very nasty statement to, essentially, 28   including them   28 countries
i think that   you know, you have a very high unemployment rate in france
france is not doing well, economically, at all
they're starting to tax other people's products, so therefore, we go and tax them
that's just taking place right now, on technology, and we're doing their wines and everything else
and it's   it's a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in france
you look at what's happened with the yellow vests, or you look at what's going on during certain parts of their season
they've had a very rough year
and you just can't go around making statements like that about nato
it's very disrespectful
well, i just don't know
yeah, i just don't know
i haven't seen it
i purposefully stay out of it
we have a great attorney general
he's a very fair man
he's a great gentleman
he didn't need this job
he took this job because he wanted to do something great for the country
as you know, he was a very successful man
picked a great company to work   when he left, as you know, he picked a great company to work for
but this is a successful man
didn't need the job
he's doing a great job
i have not seen the report
perhaps he's read the report
i think he was quoted incorrectly
i do believe that, because i'm hearing their   the report is very powerful
but i'm hearing that by lots of different things   not from inside information
it's really from outside information
i think all we have to do is wait
isn't it going to be released on monday   monday or so
i think we have to read it and we have to see it
but i hear there's a lot of devastating things in that report
but we'll see what happens
look, we have a few days to wait
we've been all waiting a long time
i do think the big report to wait for is going to be the durham report
that's the one that people are really waiting for
and he's highly respected
and we're   and he's worked very hard
and he's worked long hours, i can tell you, and gone all over world
so we'll see
but the durham report is the report people are really looking forward to
but this is a very important report
the ig report is a very important report
if what i read is correct   i read it in your newspaper   if what i read is correct, that would be a little disappointing
but it was just one asset   one aspect of the report
we'll see what happens
we'll see it
it's coming out in a few days
i hear it's devastating, but we'll soon find out
yes
well, i think the secretary general has done a good job in bringing nato together
you know, it's been unfair because the united states is paying 4 percent, and some people could say 4
3 percent, of the largest gdp there is in the world, by far, because we've brought it to a level that nobody thought even possible
so we're paying 4 to 4
3 percent, when germany is paying 1 to 1
2 percent   at max, 1
2 percent   of a much smaller gdp
that's not fair
and it's   look, it's not   it's not fair also when you have the european union   many of these are the same countries   but you have the european union treating the united states very, very unfairly on trade
the deficit, for many, many years   for decades   but the deficit, for many, many years, has been astronomical with the united states and europe   in their favor
and i'm changing that, and i'm changing it fairly rapidly
but it's not   it's not right to be taken advantage of on nato, and also, then, to be taken advantage of on trade
and that's what happens
and we can't let that happen
so, we're talking to the european union, and we're talking to various countries about nato
but we're talking to the european union about trade
and they have to shape up
otherwise, things are going to get very tough
i would say   i would say that nobody needs nato more than france
if you just look back over the last long period of time, nobody needs nato more than france
and, frankly, the one that benefits, really, the least is the united states
we benefit the least
we're helping europe
europe unites and they go against a common foe
that may or may not be a foe
can't tell you that
but there are other foes out there also
but i think nobody needs it more than france
and that's why i think that when france makes a statement like they made about nato, that's a very dangerous statement for them to make
well, look, i'm not in love with those companies   facebook and google and all of them, twitter   although i guess i do pretty well with twitter, on the other side
but i'm not necessarily in love with those companies
but they're our companies
they're american companies
i want to tax those companies
they're not going to be taxed by france
so france is going to put a tax on them
it was totally out of the blue
he just had the idea
emmanuel had an idea
let's tax those companies
well, they're american companies
i'm not going to let people take advantage of american companies
because if anyone is going to take advantage of the american companies, it's going to us
it's not going to be france
and so we're taxing   as you know, we're taxing their wines and everything else
and we have a very, very big tax to put on them
plus, we have a tax going on on airbus, and that'll be a good thing for boeing
but we're only going to do that if it's necessary
as you know, we won   in the world trade organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars
we never used to win before me, because, before me, the united states was a sucker for all of these different organizations
and now they realize   the world trade organization realizes that my attitude on them
if they don't treat us fairly, well, i'll tell you someday what will happen
and we've been winning a lot of cases at the world trade organization
we virtually   very rarely did we ever win a case
they took advantage of the united states
so that's where it is
we won seven and a half billion dollars
and if france puts a tax on our companies   again, these are companies that are against   you know, they were against me, if i read the papers correctly
i don't know why they were against me, but they were against me
they're supposed to be very powerful
and yet, i won
so maybe they're not so powerful
but they're american companies
i don't want france taxing american companies
if they're going to be taxed, it's going to be the united states will tax them
okay
because i don't want to complicate it
i can   look, i've won a lot of elections for a lot of people
if you look, just over the last few months
two elections in north carolina i won
i helped the governor of kentucky
i mean, the press doesn't write it, but they went up, supposedly, 17, 18, 19 points because of my   he lost by just a little bit
but i lifted him 19 points
in louisiana, i got them into a runoff
and after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor   john bel edwards
good guy
popular governor
he almost won
he lost by less than a point
but with the exception of those two races, where i had a huge impact because i raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance   with the exception of those two, i've won virtually every race that i've participated in
but this is a different country
and, you know, i say often
in germany, they like obama
the reason they like obama is because obama gave the ship away
he allowed them to take everything
he gave them things that i wouldn't do
and i love germany
i love this country
i love a lot of countries
but i'm representing the u
so they may not like me because i'm representing us
and i represent us strong
president obama did not represent us strong
he gave everything away, and he shouldn't have done that
and that's why we're still paying a price for what he did
so i'll stay out of the election
you know that i was a fan of brexit
i called it the day before
i was opening up turnberry the day before brexit
you were there
many of you were there
i mean, i recognize that many of you were there
and they asked me whether or not brexit would happen
i said yes, and everybody smiled and they laughed
and i said, yes, it's going to happen, in my opinion
it was just my opinion
the next day, they had the election, and i was right
but i stay out of it
i think boris is very capable, and i think he'll do a good job
say it
i think it's fine
i've always had a good relationship with emmanuel
and sometimes he'll say things that he shouldn't say
and i disagree with some of his policies with respect to france, but he's got to do what he's got to do
and sometimes i think he does things that are counterproductive for his own country
say it
i can work with anybody
i'm a very easy person to work with, you know
you wouldn't believe it
look at this gentleman
when i came in, i was angry at nato
and now i've raised $130 billion
and, by the way, you're talking annually
you know, you're talking about a tremendous amount of money
you're talking about
you're talking about numbers that are astronomical
and yet, you still have many delinquent   you know, i call them delinquent when they're not paid up in full
and then, i asked the other question
when they don't pay up in full, what happens to the past year
so let's say germany is at 1 percent and they stay at 1 percent and another 1
well, does that mean it disappears over the last five years or if they haven't paid
you know, nobody has ever asked that question
it's not a bad question for you to be asking
because, you know, it's not like, oh, gee
let's start a brand-new year
a lot of countries haven't paid
and you could make the case that they haven't paid
they're, really, delinquent for 25, 30 years
and then you add all that up, and nato is a very rich system
you know that, right
so, you know, they haven't chosen to go that way
but when germany is at 1 to 1
2 percent, and when they don't pay up to the 2   and, let me tell you, the 2 is a very low number
you know, it really should be 4
it shouldn't be 2
it should be 4
but that's the way it is
yeah
please
i don't think so
you know, i know most of the leaders
i get along with them
it's a hoax
the impeachment thing is a hoax
it's turned out to be a hoax
it's done for purely political gain
they're going to see whether or not they can do something in 2020, because otherwise they're going to lose
it's turning out   and you see it better than anybody
i read something in your paper the other day that it's having a reverse effect, which some people thought it might have
i didn't know
but i can tell you, the districts where i won, and then they had an election in between mine   but they had an election and other people got in
democrats got in   those districts are leaning very big toward me
now, i wasn't in the race in 2018
so it's not really the same thing
and a lot of my voters say they're not going to vote unless trump is actually in the race
but it's really having a tremendous impact on   and a lot of democrats, i hear, are very upset
they just got back from their district, and i hear they're very upset
the impeachment witch hunt   it's really just a continuation of the hoax that's been taking place for the last three years
and i think you know that
well, i would say this
i think it's very unpatriotic of the democrats to put on a performance where they do that
i do
i think it   i think it's a bad thing for our country
impeachment wasn't supposed to be used that way
all you have to do is read the transcripts
you'll see there was absolutely nothing done wrong
they had legal scholars looking at the transcripts the other day, and they say, these are absolutely perfect
trump is right when he uses the word
those concept   those calls that we made   two of them   were absolutely perfect calls
and i think it's a very bad thing for our country
does it cast a cloud
well, if it does, then the democrats have done a very great disservice to the country, which they have
they've wasted a lot of time
we're trying to get prescription drugs reduced very substantially
we could do it easily
they don't have any time to do anything
i call them the do nothing democrats
they are hurting our country very badly
i may
i may
i have a very good relationship
i may
i   you know, it could be   i don't know   i don't know if it's on the schedule
but if it isn't, i would
well, i'd have to ask the other countries
i mean, i have my own views, but i wouldn't say it here
good relationship with turkey
we left their border
we've been on their border long enough
they're doing just fine on their border
we kept the oil
i kept the oil
the only people we have over there now   we have a few that   a small group that are fighting the remnants of isis because they've popped up again and we put them down
we've defeated the isis caliphate
nobody thought we could do that so quickly
i did it very quickly
when i came in, it was virtually 100 percent
and i knocked it down to 0
i knocked it down to 0
but it pops up every once in a while
so we have a very small group there
and we're   and we're doing it with others, in all fairness
but, importantly, we kept the oil
and the oil is what fueled isis
that's what fueled them
that's what they   that's what gave them the economic strength to do what they did
and, of course, we killed al-baghdadi
and we also killed his second
so that was very important, because he was trying to re-form isis
say it
no, not at all
i have nothing to do with it
never ever thought about it, honestly
we have enough   look, we are going to have a great healthcare system
we're doing great healthcare work
we've got things really running well
and if we get   if we get elected   if we take the house, keep the senate, keep the white house   we'll have phenomenal healthcare
but right now, we've made it very good
and we have 180 million people on plans that they absolutely love   private plans that they absolutely love
but in this country   no, they have to work that out for themselves
we have absolutely   i don't even know where that rumor started
we have absolutely nothing to do with it, and we wouldn't want to
if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it
unacceptable
i did nothing wrong
i heard about it
now they want to go to censure because they have no case for impeachment, so they want to go to censure
i don't want them to go to censure
i did nothing   i don't mind be censured if you do something wrong
i did nothing wrong
i had a great conversation, very respectful conversation with the president   a good person, by the way   with the president of ukraine
it was flawless
people have analyzed it from 15 different ways
it was flawless
you know, there were many people on that line, including the secretary of state
and one person   two people had a complaint
and you take a look at those two people, and you tell me
but many people   and i know there were many people on the line
i mean, there's always a lot of people when you speak to a head of state
not only our people, they had people also
many people, probably
no, i wouldn't be happy with that at all
that's   to me, it's unacceptable
i did nothing wrong
you don't censure somebody when they did nothing wrong
they're in search of a crime   that's what they are
they're what you call an investigation in search of a crime
there was no   not only wasn't there a crime
it's not even a word that should be used
i had a very, very good conversation with the head of ukraine
and, by the way, yesterday, he came out again and reaffirmed again that we had a very, very respectful, good conversation   that president trump did nothing wrong
well, thank you very much
that was great
and we just had a nice thanksgiving dinner
i thought i was going to be having it someplace else, and senator barrasso is a great friend of mine, and he said, that'll be great if we did it
i said, you come with me, john
and he came with me
john, thank you very much
great friend of ours
he's a great senator and a great man
and i want to thank general milley
special warrior
he's a special warrior
and i want to congratulate you also because i just saw some numbers that are incredible
isis   you're wiping them out left and right
there's almost nothing left in this area
you're not going to be lonely
and al-qaeda, the same thing
and tremendous progress
and, you know, we have a very special friend of ours that's here
we had a meeting a little while ago
i said, would you like to come over and say hello to the troops
and he said, that would be such an honor
and i think what i'll do is, before i start, i'll bring up the president of afghanistan
president ghani is here
so please, mr
president, we'd love to have you say something
thank you
fantastic
thank you very much
well, thank you very much, mr
president
fifty-two, compared to thousands
and we're doing a tremendous job
and, as you know, a big part of that job is isis   certainly the biggest   and al qaeda
and we   we've got them down to very low numbers
we'll have that totally taken care of in a very short period of time
and we'll see what happens
the taliban wants to make a deal
we'll see if they want to make a deal
it's got to be a real deal, but we'll see
but they want to make a deal
and they only want to make a deal because you're doing a great job
that's the only reason they want to make a deal
so i want to thank you, and i want to thank the afghan soldiers for really   i've spoken to a lot of you today, and you say they're really fighting hard
i was very impressed with that, actually
so i want to thank you
and, general milley, again, to be at bagram airfield, i've heard to much about it
it's an incredible place
this is some   some airfield, some fortress
i want to thank all of the afghanistanian troops
we have a lot of them here, actually
we have a number of them standing around, saying hello and waving
and we appreciate it
and i also say to you, just at ease
let's just enjoy ourselves for a couple of minutes
i'm going to introduce a few people
but there's nowhere i'd rather celebrate this thanksgiving than right here with the toughest, strongest, best, and bravest warriors on the face of the earth
you are indeed that
you know, when i took office   if you can believe it, almost three years ago   we were very depleted
our military was depleted, in terms of equipment
you see, right
they were all shaking their heads
that's right
we have all those brand-new planes and brand-new helicopters and brand-new ships being built now
brand-new, incredible submarines
probably the most powerful submarines   probably the most powerful weapon in the world, is what we're building, in the form of submarines
nobody's   nothing is even close
but we have things that nobody has seen, nobody has heard about
and we'll keep it that way
but we've spent $2
5 trillion   very close to that number
and very shortly, it will be at $2
5 trillion
and while i don't love that   you know, what that does to my budget, because i'm a budget person   we don't have a strong military budget, it don't matter much do they, huh
i can  have to worry about budgets
so, with what's going on in the world today   very important
5 trillion
and nobody beats our great army, navy, air force, coast guard, marines
and we think, soon, we're going to be adding a thing called space   you know about that, right
space
we're going to have space covered very well
we're covering it now, but we have to cover it to a much greater extent
and you'll be hearing about that in the coming days and weeks
i've just come from serving thanksgiving dinner to some of you   i recognize already, some of you in the audience
and   with general milley and the folks
and we had a good time
i then got down   i sat down
i had a gorgeous piece of turkey
and i was all set to go, and i had some of the mashed potatoes and i had a bite of mashed potatoes
and i never got to the turkey, because general milley said, come on over, sir
let's take some pictures
i never got to my turkey
it's the first time in thanksgiving that i've never had anything called turkey
but that's okay
but it looked awfully good, i have to tell you that
i should have started with that, instead of the mashed potatoes
i made a mistake
but i hope everyone enjoyed the fantastic meal
it certainly did look good
and hopefully everyone can get some well-deserved rest this holiday
your family   they're home, and they love you so much
we flew 8,331 miles to be here tonight for one simple reason
to tell you, in person, that this thanksgiving is a special thanksgiving
we're doing so well
our country is the strongest, economically, it's ever been
we have never done so well
we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world
so it's nice to know that you're fighting for something that is doing well, as opposed to something that was not doing well just a number of years ago
our stock market has reached the highest level ever in the history of the exchanges   all three, if you look
all three
it's incredible
it's incredible, what's happening
it just broke a record
i think it's close to 130 days
so we're less than three years, and 130 times we've broken the all-time record
and to me, that doesn't mean an all-time record
it means something different
it means jobs
it means 401(k)s
people come up to me with their 401(k)s, they say, sir, you've made me look like a genius
thank you very much
you know, they're up 78 percent
they feel good
so i would just want to say that we thank god for your health and all of the things that you've done
you are very special people
and you don't even know how much the people of our country love and respect you
and they do
it's why i'm here
i'm just bringing the message
the courageous american warriors in afghanistan and across the region are leading the fight to vanquish america's enemies and defeat forces of radical islamic terrorism
i would say it so often during the campaign
that's what we're doing
together, we're making tremendous progress
just a few weeks ago, as you know, and as president ghani mentioned, u
special forces brought the world's number-one, most wanted terrorist to justice
when the president said more important than osama bin laden, i would say that, look, you know   different, in a way
he was an organizer
al-baghdadi was an organizer
he was the founder of isis
he was the father, if you want to call him that, of isis
i think he wasn't so happy, three weeks ago, when he saw those incredible 67 men, in that case, just come pouring down onto where he was staying
and that didn't work out too good
and we have a new national hero
you know who that is, right
conan
conan is a new   is our new great hero
that was some-   and conan was at the white house the other day
you might have seen it
and it was something
but the animal known as al-baghdadi   the founder, the leader of isis, the man that was trying to reinstitute isis, because we've defeated   we have 100 percent of the isis caliphate in syria is now ours   he is dead
his second is dead
his third   we have the sights on the third
i think the third doesn't want the job
the third is saying, you know what
maybe i'll go work in a store, or something
but baghdadi was a savage and soulless monster who raped, tortured, and slaughtered the innocent, including many, many americans
when you saw those folks   those great people in the orange jumpsuits, oftentimes standing on a beach with a thug behind him and a big knife   that was all al-baghdadi
but he's gone
the american warriors hunted him down, they executed a masterful raid, and they punched his ticket to hell
that's what happened
shortly after we got baghdadi, we focused on some other elements in the area
and we also started leaving the area, because it's secure
but we didn't leave it totally
we kept the oil
makes sense, right
i've been saying for a long time, keep the oil
hate to say it
i used to say it with a place called iraq, too
keep the oil
they didn't listen to me
i was a civilian
they didn't listen
now they have to listen
but we kept the oil
and we kept it and we can help the kurds
we can help our partners
we can have it developed
it's where they got their wealth
that's where they got their money
we kept it
so, we'll go back in when we have to, as it arises
but 100 percent
we have thousands of prisoners
we'd like europe to take those prisoners
they have not stepped up to the plate at all
many come from france
many come from germany
they come from different countries in europe
they have not stepped up to the plate
that's not good
we have to talk to them, john, because they should be taking those people back and trying them
and if we didn't do it, they'd go back to france and they'd go back to germany and to uk, and to all of   all of the places where they came
that's where they want to go back
and they should take them
weeks ago, we also announced that the forces are coming back
they're coming back home
we're reducing over here, but because of technology and all of things that we have, we're able to reduce, in afghanistan   very substantially, actually reduce   and do even more devastating attacks on the enemy
so, that's part of the $2
5 trillion that we have coming
finest equipment in the world
we build the greatest equipment anywhere in the world, by far
and we're selling that equipment now to many, many countries that are our allies
the enemies, we decide usually not to do it
history has said, don't sell the good equipment to the enemy
our message to the bloodthirsty terrorists is clear
you will not escape your wretched fate, because the long reach and the really awesome power of the united states military is unstoppable
we have the most powerful military in the world, by far
there's nobody close
and we're going to keep it that way
we're going to keep it that way
this evening, as millions of families sit down at their dinner tables back home, they'll be saying a prayer for the men and women serving our nation in afghanistan and deployed all around the globe   great men and women, all around the globe
many are coming home
our citizens know that you're standing guard, killing terrorists, crushing our enemies, and keeping america safe   really safe
but you're also keeping it strong, and proud, and mighty, and free
and i'm here today to just really say, happy thanksgiving
but also, thank you very much
great job
thank you very much
we appreciate it
appreciate it
very much appreciate it
as president, i have no higher honor than to serve as commander-in-chief of the united states military   the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world
this evening, i also want to express the profound and heartfelt gratitude of the entire american nation for our amazing military families, because they really do make you what you are, when you think of it
anybody here disagree with that
raise your hand, please
nobody has the courage to raise your hand
you have a lot of courage, but not that kind of courage, right
no, but it's true
the families   they make you great
the extraordinary commitment and the sacrifice of your loved ones make it possible for all of our families to live in safety and to live in peace
i especially want to recognize several of the incredible patriots with us tonight
these are great fighters, great warriors, great people, great men and women
you've already met chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
it was my honor to appoint him
i had no doubt, from the day i met him   i met him very early on
and i said, i like that man
he's a tough cookie and he's smart
you know, he went to princeton
i said, i don't know
i didn't know he was an academic
and he went to columbia
i'm not sure
was that a good thing or a bad
i don't know
did i like it or not
i was, sort of   but that's pretty good
that means he's an academic
that means he's a smart cookie
and he is a smart   and he's a tough one
general mark milley
thank you, general
he's an academic
i can't believe it
he's a great gentleman
commander of the resolute support and u
forces afghanistan, general scotty miller
he's done an incredible job
thank you, scotty
thank you, scotty
incredible job
and i hope the word gets out
and i hope the press, which is right back here   they traveled with us   i hope they're able to get the word out as to what scotty and all of the folks have done, with respect to isis and with respect to al qaeda
he said, they don't want to fight us, sir
they don't want to fight us
but, you know, what   what we've done over the last 12 months   6 months and 12 months, but over the last 12 months   has been incredible
and i hope that the media is able to tell our families, tell our friends, tell our citizens, tell the people of the united states the success that we've had, because people don't read about that
they don't read about it
commander of bagram airfield, brigadier general brian wolford
thank you, brian

also with us are national security advisor robert o'brien   doing a great job
ambassador john bass
and i introduced already one of the great, great patriots of our country, john barrasso of wyoming
great state
wyoming
thank you, john
with the help and the devotion everyone has given here tonight, america is winning again
we are winning like we have not won in a long time
and you know what
we're respected like we haven't been respected in a long time
america is winning again, and america is respected again and respected at the highest level
we're investing so much money in our military, and we're not going to stop until it's totally rebuilt and complete
along with a record investment in our military, we've also got your largest pay raise in over 10 years
and i'm very pleased to report that, starting january 1st, you will be receiving another 3
1 percent pay raise
and if anybody doesn't want it
if anybody doesn't want it, just sign up at the door and we'll take it away
okay
make it a contribution
here in the region, we're boldly confronting america's adversaries and pursing a foreign policy focused squarely on our national interests
less than three years ago, isis controlled the vast reaches of territory in iraq and syria
today, the u
armed forces and our allies have totally obliterated isis and its caliphate
and, you know, i was going to leave
we were down to 98 percent
and i have to say this
when i came in   again, less than three years ago   it was a mess
they were all over the place
and i was about set   we'll leave now
we were at 97, 98 percent
and i got a lot of   a lot of bite-back from people that, frankly, would have been very happy to leave if it was anybody else but me
they said, why don't you finish the job
these are people that would have loved   but, you know what
i said, maybe they're right
and we finished the job
we did it very, very quickly, and very surgically
so that job is finished
we liberated more than 3 million civilians from that brutal reign
i've also taken action to confront the corrupt and terror-supporting dictatorship in iran
and, in afghanistan, our warfighters continue to serve heroically to stamp out terrorism and to eviscerate the enemies of civilization
because that's what, really, they are
they're enemies of civilization
right here, at bagram, you are logistical hub for all forces in afghanistan
you are absolutely essential to victory
from this base, the unrivaled aviators of the u
air force deliver unmatched firepower across the region
when our enemies hear the sound of your jets   those brand-new, beautiful jets   they hear the sound of those jets
we don't put too many environmental controls on those jets
because if it takes away 4 percent of what we need, we want the 4 percent
do you agree with that, everybody
is everybody
and we're all environment, but we're not heavy into environmental controls, and even pollution controls, on our aircraft when it's a fighting jet
we don't want to have any excuses
but when our enemies hear the sound of those screaming engines through the valleys, their terrorist blood runs cold because they know that their demise is near
in particular, i want to thank outstanding airmen from the 455th air expeditionary wing, who deliver righteous american thunder anywhere, anyplace, anytime
raise your hands
let me see
great
great job
helps to have new equipment, doesn't it
does it help a little bit
you got nice, new equipment
thanks as well to the skilled professionals of the expeditionary medical group     who run the most capable trauma hospital in afghanistan
craig joint theater hospital
thank you very much
great job you do
nobody
i'll tell you what, there's a little phrase that i hear
nobody dies today
they live to fight another day
you've done a fantastic job
and i'm told that, not long ago, a critically injured soldier was brought here in need of multiple blood transfusions
within 15 minutes, more than 100 members of bagram   the community, the base   showed up to give their blood
that says everything you need to know about the men and women who serve here
thank you very much
it was incredible
they needed it fast, and they got it
they got it
every day, the fierce soldiers of the u
army are carrying out harrowing missions across this land
the army marches bravely into danger, traverses perilous terrain, and pumps stunning firepower straight into the face of evil
in particular, i want to thank the men and women of the 10th combat aviation brigade, who operate rotary   oh, i know what rotary is, right
rotary wing aircraft across afghanistan, and fly magnificent apaches like the one right next to me
that is magnificent
and i was just at the   at dover, because you had a terrible accident a week ago of two of your incredible people
and i greeted them as they came in on a very big plane
and i greeted their families
i heard they were fantastic people
so thank you very much for that
i know a lot of you asked about them
their families are doing fine, but that was a rough night for them, i will tell you
it's a rough night for me
it's a rough night for everybody
thanks also to the 1st armor division's resolute support sustainment brigade for supplying our forces
the brigade is incredible   so respected by everybody   keeping our military in top fighting shape
you are iron soldiers, they say
iron soldiers
do you think so
yeah
right
i think so
and among those in rssb are two sisters
master sergeant eliana gallardo and captain carla gallardo
and i don't know   where are you
where are you two sisters
where are they
they're here someplace
come here
come
have you ever spoken publicly
give it a sho-
she said, yes
that's pretty good
please, say something please
thank you both
thank you
thank you
thank you very much
thank you both very much
i know that senator barrasso is very proud of the fact that wyoming's national guard is here at bagram
oh, you get them, huh
where are they
come here
come here
say a few words
these people are all action, no talk
but i just want to thank you for being here
and the alpha battery second of the 300th field artillery battalion, thank you very much
your first lieutenant ira werger and first sergeant michael clancy   i want to thank you very much for doing such a great job in leading the unit
let me also recognize the terrific service members from area support group afghanistan
jtf parwan
task force cobalt
our theater reaction force   fury
task force griffin
task force hellhound eod
where are you
task force loyalty
i like them
i like them there
task force hiki no
hiki no
where are you, hiki no
that's great
that's great
warfighters, keep up the great work
really, keep up the great work
that's fantastic
and we're glad we could mention most of you
i know we left somebody out
did we leave anybody out
i agree
who else
together, we're all very proud of the part the most feared and lethal fighting force ever assembled has played toward peace
america's military dominates the sky
nobody can dominate the sky like we do
we have the new f-35s coming out   stealth, and even super-stealth
it's hard for the enemy because there's one problem they have
you can't see the planes
it's always tough to fight a plane when you can't see it
but america's military dominates the sky
you dominate the sea
you dominate the land
you dominate space
you will not be deterred, and you will never, ever be defeated
the united states never seeks war
we seek peace wherever peace can be found
we want peace
we do want peace
i want peace more than anybody
you know, they said, when i was elected, oh, we'll be in a war in the first day
right
remember that
but when we do, and if we do   and i hope we never do   we will win
we're going to fight to win
we only fight to win
we only fight to win
but if we are forced, we will avenge the enemy with overwhelming power, and we will win like   the old days, we won
then we went where we sort of played for ties
but we don't play for ties anymore
we don't do the tie thing anymore
is that okay with you folks
is that all right
victory on the battlefield will always belong to you, the american warrior
in the long run, of course, the future of afghanistan and nations across this region will not be decided on the battlefield
ultimately, there will be   need to be a political solution, and we're working with the president and we're working with a lot of people right now on a political solution decided by the people of the region themselves
but rest assured that my administration will always be committed to annihilating terrorists wherever they appear, because we don't want them in our country
we're going to tell them, get the hell out
and we're doing it all the time
get them out
and we will continue to work tirelessly for the day when we can bring each and every one of you home and safe to your family
and that day is coming   coming very soon
in the 18 years since the attacks of september 11th, thousands of american patriots have left their everyday lives and cherished loved ones, put on their uniforms, and flown here to afghanistan
some of our brave warriors have made the ultimate sacrifice
we honor their memory today, and we will always honor their memory
like all of them, each of you came to do your duty
you came to defend american liberty
you came because our nation needed you, and they needed you right here
the men and women of our military are totally loyal to our country
and every day i am president, america will always be totally loyal to you
i just want to finish by saying that, with your courage, we will continue to pursue america's enemies to ends of the earth
greatest in the world
we will chase them down
we will get the terrorists
we will break their will
we will not give them rest   no break and no way out
they won't have a chance
as long as america's soldiers, sailors, airmen, coast guardsmen, and marines are on the mission, our nation's adversaries do not have even a small hope of victory
together, we will preserve our freedom, we will protect our homeland, and we will always defend and honor our great american flag
i want to thank you, bagram air base
this is a special place   a place that everybody talks about in our country
what you've done here and what you've built here is powerful
and i just want to say
next year, we'll be having thanksgiving together   it may be back in the united states   because you've done so much work here, and you've done it well
god bless you
god bless our great country
god bless everybody in this room
be safe
i will see you very soon
we will be back
we'll be back
and we are coming back as a country like nobody has ever seen
when i'm greeted   and i'm often greeted   by leaders of the world, they start off by saying two things
congratulations on what you've done with your country, from an economic standpoint
we've never seen anything like it
and, sir, congratulations on rebuilding your military
and that's what we've done
god bless you all
thank you very much
thank you
well, he did indeed and he used it well, a little bit different time, we have a little   few more options, bill
a few more options today, which i like and social media has been very dominant, and it's certainly been a very good thing for me because the press is so dishonest, just unbelievable
so, with social media, i can go around the corrupt media
well, i was mentioned just   very unimportantly, and as you know, joe biden's son became rich, as soon as, joe biden became vice president, and in my way of thinking, that's totally corrupt
and the press, this is what i talk about, the media, they don't want to cover it
every republican is shaking their head
they can't believe it
i have the highest rating ever in the history of the republican party, 95% approval
ronald reagan was at 87%, he was second
they see what i'm saying
joe biden, it was   it's criminal what they've done, and frankly, that they get away with it is amazing
the son who was   who didn't have a job, who got thrown out of the navy, who was really down and out, all of a sudden, is making millions and millions and millions of dollars working with ukraine
he had no knowledge of energy
he was working with an energy company, as you know, has no knowledge of energy, and they were paying him, i guess many people say, $168,000 a month, it varies, but we know it's very high, millions of dollars
then he goes to china, picks up $1
5 billion for a fund, which is tens of millions of dollars a year in fees and other things
and now, other countries are coming to light
it's a payoff
it's absolutely a payoff
no, the call was a perfect call
i had your friend, mark levin go do a whole show on it
i had gregg jarrett
i didn't have   they did it
i just happened to see it
i had gregg jarrett analyze it
there was nothing said wrong
it was a very, very nice call
but we have to look for corruption, bill, we have to look for corruption
i mean, we're sending them tremendous amounts of money
we don't want to be sending it for corrupt purposes
and the other thing that bothers me is why isn't france and germany, and you know, nato, you could say, why aren't these other countries and institutions, why aren't they paying some of the money
why is it always this sucker, united states
and that's probably millions all the time
well, it's a false narrative and it's shocking, except that they're corrupt
the media is a part of the democrat party, essentially, and the media is very corrupt
not all of it, i know some great journalists and some good, honorable folks
but generally speaking, you read these stories in the new york times or the washington post, it has nothing to do with those hearings, and you see what's happening with the polls, way down, the concept of impeaching the president are way down
they've taken a dive since the hearings, and the hearings were rigged
adam schiff wouldn't give us lawyers
he wouldn't give us witnesses
we can't talk to the whistleblower, who is a fake whistleblower
we have to talk to adam schiff
why did adam schiff make up what i said
he went before congress and read a statement about what i said, but it wasn't what i said
he made it up, 100% made it up
no, he wasn't mocking me, bill
bill, he wasn't mocking me
he was trying to get them to believe i said what he made up and it was horrible what he said
that's why i released the transcript
well, you have to ask that to rudy
but rudy, i don't, i don't even know
i know he was going to go to ukraine, and i think, he canceled a trip
but, you know, rudy has other clients other than me
i'm one person
no, but   but you have to understand, rudy is a great corruption fighter
he's one of the greatest in the last 50 years
he was the greatest mayor in the history of the city of new york, by far, much better than bloomberg
i mean, bloomberg when he took it over, the crime was in great shape
i mean, rudy did a great job as mayor
and you know, when you think, i mean, he has to look, i mean, he felt, he felt personally insulted by what happened during my campaign because there were a lot of bad things happening, and you know that better than anybody else
a lot of really bad things were happening during my campaign
in a way, it's a miracle that i won because with all of those horrible things with the media against, with the dishonesty, the tremendous dishonesty
then you hear about google and facebook and twitter, everybody against, and we won
and really, i guess, you could say it was a landslide in the electoral college, and it's a pretty big victory
yeah
no, i didn't direct him but he's a warrior, rudy's a warrior
rudy went, he possibly saw something
but you have to understand, rudy has other people that he represents
he has
i think he's done work in ukraine for years
you know, i've just absolutely done a lot of   he's done a lot of work in ukraine over the years, and i think, i mean that's what i heard
and i might have even read that someplace, but he's a good man and he's an honorable guy, and he's a great crime fighter, corruption fighter
probably the best in 50 years and when he saw it, when he saw what, you know, he was very much involved in this fake, phony mueller report that took two years, and he saw what happened and he was aggrieved by it, as was i and as was everybody else who was involved
it was a disgrace
well, i knew i did nothing wrong, just like hillary clinton the other day said that tulsi gabbard and that jill stein, the green party, that they're agents of russia
well, that's the same thing they said about me and it was just as fake
now, i know, i don't know those two people, but i know they have nothing to do with russia, ok
but with me, it took me two years to get out of that
it's a disgrace
now, well, i hope i didn't show emotion because i don't like to show too much emotion, i will be honest
we went through two years of a witch hunt like nobody's ever gone through
and i won and there was no collusion whatsoever, and there were thousands of subpoenas and hundreds of interviews, and you know, you say who knows what they're going to say
people could lie
people could, who knows what's going to happen and it came out, no collusion
after all of that work, it came out, no collusion
and there were a few people, there were a few people
nobody apologized
no, they don't apologize
they're bad people
nope, not one person said it and mueller didn't say it
his bunch of 13 angry democrats never said it
it went to 18, by the way, as you know
but they never said it
the washington post never apologized to me for false reporting for years
the new york times didn't apologize
nobody apologized
cnn, i mean, cnn, they had
yeah, i know, but nobody apologized, it's a very good   well, i hadn't thought of it that way
i guess, they're so bad and so evil, i never expected to have an apology
no, we've done a lot of work together
well, i got along with john, i always did but he was having a little difficulty with some of the other folks
and it was time, it was not a big deal, i didn't think and i've always liked him
he's a tough guy
he's, you know, has a tough attitude on the world and i do too, frankly
maybe i would be a little bit, a little bit longer in terms of to accepting, i could wait a little bit longer, and maybe, i'm more severe than he is
i mean, it's you know, but john, i've always liked him
i've always gotten along and he's had a couple of people in there, one in particular who i really liked, who worked very closely with him, and you know, we very much are of the same thing
other than sometimes, he'd want to go a little bit faster and do it faster than me
he's a warrior in the sense that he wants to take care of things when this country isn't respected
different, really differences with not me as much as one or two other people that are important, you know, that have positions that are very important
but i would say
well, whoever, that you'd have to ask them
you could ask john
but i actually
i had a very good relationship with john, actually
well, he's a hawk, no doubt about it
he's a hawk, there's no doubt and you're not going to change that
i wouldn't want to change that
i viewed john, as you know, very much of an advantage because i'll make that final decision, but you know, bringing john in, the other side views it, and they say, wow, he's tough
so, no, my relationship with john was a very good relationship, actually
they're much tougher negotiators with me than they were with, where's hunter
meaning, biden
i call him where's hunter because he disappears, and then, just takes all the money that he ripped off and disappears
do you ever notice, one of the most incredible things is during the debates, it's such a big subject
i'll tell you one thing, if he gets the nomination, that's going to dominate my debates
it's going to dominate
i will make sure it dominates because what he did is corrupt
but do you ever notice that not one democrat, you know, they'll debate each other, they want to win
they never mention that and i watched anderson cooper during one of the debates, and he brought it up almost like he was embarrassed to even bring up the subject
because they're corrupt
they're corrupt
it's a corrupt establishment
you look at espn and you look at what they've done, if i do something great, for instance, al baghdadi, i took that   we killed al baghdadi
i'm sorry, cnn
espn is pretty bad, too, by the way, if you want to know the truth
that's why they're down the dog   that's why they're down the tubes
i mean, you look at what's happened to espn, it's like a different deal, but they're pretty bad, too
in fact, maybe just as bad
but that's why they're down
but do you ever notice the academy awards used to be the greatest thing
that's way down because they were hitting trump and they were hitting millions of millions of our people and they turned off
they turned off
now it's not even doing well
the academy awards was the biggest thing outside of the super bowl
now, it's like a regular show because they were hitting our people and our people don't need to, they don't want to take it
they don't want to take it
but, no, cnn, if you look at cnn, the way they   i mean, it's just story after story
hopefully, i'll be   hopefully, we'll be talking for five more years, ok
but when i do leave, at some point, you know, a lot of them think i'll never leave
i mean, this character, bill maher, said he'll never leave
don't you know he's going to win
but he's never going to leave, no matter what, he'll never leave
don't you know that
and i used to think he was kidding
he's actually serious
he really believes that, but let's say, i'm there, hopefully, for five years, we'll win and we'll do good
look, the economy just hit a new record, as we're speaking, just hit a brand new record, greatest economy in the history of our country
the stock market just hit a new record, it's up a lot today, and that's great because you know, i view it as not that way, i view it as jobs
every time i see that going up, i know it's jobs
did you ever hear
i mean, of course, you did, but it's the economy is stupid
i guess that was clinton or somebody
it's all about the economy
well, i have the greatest economy in the history of politics
all right
nobody's ever had an economy like i do
i hope it stays this way but i have the greatest   nobody gives me any credit for that
nobody says, well, he can't be beaten because the economy so strong
if i were a democrat, and if i had this economy, and if hillary got in, by the way, the economy would be, it would have crashed, it would have crashed
but if i were a democrat with this economy, it wouldn't even be a contest
they'd all be talking about, he can't be beaten, the economy is too good
very famous line, you know, it's the economy, stupid
it's all about the economy
so, i have the strongest economy in the history of politics
nobody's ever
because of me, it's now a vibrant paper for a little while, but after i'm gone, hopefully, that'll be a long time, but because we still have a lot of work to do
but after i'm gone, bill, it goes out of business
i'm not, i'm not interested in that, but that's ok
go ahead
you know i'm interested in   i'm interested in one thing
i'm interested in what i'm doing now, to make the country, it's really about to make america great again
now, it's getting to be, keep america great
that being
right
me, i'm holding it up
wow
wow
man, this is a big place
thank you very much and thank you to vice president mike pence, who's doing a fantastic job, and thank you to the great state of florida
thank you
thank you
so, less than one year from now, i will join voters across the sunshine state, my home
as we head to the polls and together, we will win back the house, we will hold the senate, and we will keep that beautiful, beautiful white house
we will keep it
we will keep it
you know he just had another stock rocket
you saw that, right
the stock market just hit another all-time in history high, meaning, 401(k)s and jobs
everybody's getting rich, and i'm working my ass off, that i think, i do
before you leave the arena, make sure that you register to vote
we can't take any chances
we're doing great in florida
as you know, you have a great governor, we're very happy with ron
he's doing a fantastic job, but make sure you register to vote
as we gather together for thanksgiving, you know, some people want to change the name thanksgiving
they don't want to use the term thanksgiving, and that was true also with christmas, but now, everybody's using christmas again, remember, i said that
but now, we're going to have to do a little work on thanksgiving, people have different ideas why it shouldn't be called thanksgiving
but everybody in this room i know, loves the name thanksgiving and we're not changing it
but americans have so much to be thankful for, the economy is booming, wages are rising, crime is falling, poverty is plummeting, confidence is soaring, and america is stronger than ever before
it's true
we've created 6
7 million new jobs, including 600,000 jobs right here in the great state of florida
we're protecting american workers, taking care of our amazing veterans, by the way, you know, the veterans for years and years and years, i was like you, i was a civilian
i love my life, my life was so much simpler
it was so nice and soft and easy
you build a building and you have fun, but i always see, you turn on the news, you read in the paper about our veterans being mistreated
they were doing such a poor job
you don't hear that anymore do you
you don't hear it anymore
our veterans, for the first time, are taken care of to a level that has never happened in our country before, and maybe, most importantly, right now is the world the way it is
we are rebuilding the awesome power of the united states, military, $2
5 trillion and everything is made right here in the usa
that's good
we make the greatest equipment in the world
and a few weeks ago, u
s special forces brought the world's no
1 terrorist to justice
the bloodthirsty savage known as al baghdadi is dead, finally
and just this week, i stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state, and you know what i'm talking about
i had so many people say, sir, i don't think you should do that
people have to be able to fight
these are great warriors
they can't think, gee, whiz, if i make a mistake, do i go for it
you do that
i mean, you know, if they were doing   they wanted to put him in jail for 25 years
one young man was in jail for seven years, he had 16 more years to go, and i want to tell you when you look at what they did to that man, you would have been very proud at what we ended up doing
he came out
he hugged his parents, it was a beautiful, a beautiful thing
we gave him a party because we're going to take care of our warriors, and i will always stick up for our great fighters
people can sit there and air-conditioned offices and complain, but you know what, it doesn't matter to me whatsoever, they're out of that field and they're doing a job for us like nobody else anywhere in the world can do
and the fact is, america is winning again and america is respected again
but while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists and taking care of our borders, really setting records now, you see what's going on, and the wall is happening
it's getting built rapidly and that's a real wall
the radical-left democrats are trying to rip our nation apart
first, it was the russia hoax, total hoax
it was a failed overthrow attempt and the biggest fraud in the history of our country, and then, you look at the mueller deal
do you remember that mess
they had nothing, two years, they spent $45 million, and the real cost is many times that number
and now, the same maniacs are pushing the deranged impeachment
and think of this, impeachment, impeachment  a witch hunt the same as before, and they're pushing that impeachment, witch hunt, and a lot of bad things happening to them because do you see what's happening in the polls
everybody said that's really bullshit, true
everybody
now, the fake news back there, they're going to say, the president came, they will never talk about the crowd
you know, one of the democrats yesterday had a rally, two people showed up, two people
they give us no credit
if somebody has a rally like a thousand people, they'll say so-and-so had a rally, it was packed, they had a thousand people
if we have a rally with 50,000 people, they don't talk about it, and i don't know much about this stadium
but i can tell you, it's big and you go outside, and there are a lot of people outside that can't get in, right
but the lies of the democrats are being exposed, their schemes are unraveling, their crimes, and that's what it is, crimes
did you ever hear this guy corrupt politician schiff
he made up my statement to the ukrainian president
he made it up
these are crooked people, but their crimes are being revealed and their sinister plans are failing at a level that nobody thought, even me, possible
the radical democrats are trying to overturn the last election because they know that they cannot win the next election
it's very simple
you know when i started this
you know when i started this
i said we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we're going to do   it didn't mean anything
you know it's just like another guy trying to get elected
you know they're all trying so hard, but it's tough
it's not easy
it's not
you know when a guy goes out and they want to get people and nobody shows, it's true
it's not easy, but when i started this, no, no they haven't
that's normal
this is not normal
do you think this is normal
can i be honest in front of those fakers back there, some of the most corrupt people in the world
i will tell you in front of these guys, and they're fake, and they're corrupt, but i will tell you this in front of the media
let me just say, this has never happened before
we go out, we never have an empty seat, and all i say is, let's go to florida
just get me the biggest arena
it doesn't matter where
let's go to wisconsin
let's go to michigan
let's go to pennsylvania, north carolina, south carolina, let's go anywhere, michigan, michigan
and all i say is, it doesn't matter, just get me the biggest arena, and we get these massive arenas like this one, and they're packed
and we put big screens outside so people can see, and it happens because there's something happening in our country, like has never ever been seen before
in the twisted world view of the washington, very sick democrats, it was totally fine when crooked hillary clinton ran her outrageous pay-for-play schemes out of the state department
and then, she deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a subpoena from congress that was standard play
but when i have a perfect phone call, i use that   it's a perfect call
there was a woman today being interviewed, they were talking to women who voted for trump and they were trying to find   no, no, no, they were trying to find
it's one of those crazy networks
you know the ones i'm talking about and they couldn't find the right guy
so, they got these 10 women and they were all for trump, but they wanted to say, i voted for trump or i won't do it again
they all said, they said, so, who's voting for trump
ten hands, right
no, no, it's incredible what's happening, it's incredible
they actually said   and i shouldn't say this because they'll bring it up, but we have the greatest base in the history of politics
that's my opinion, ok
you're the smartest
they don't like to say that about you
hey, i went to great colleges
you went to great schools or colleges, you people are successful as hell
they like to try and demean, always best, well, this and that
let me tell you, we're winning, you're smarter, you're better-looking, you're sharper, and they call themselves elite
but if they're elite, then, we're the super-elite
it's true
it's true
they talk about these people that are elite, that you know, that are running
i mean, have you been watching these debates
what's elite about that
what's the elite, there's nothing elite, but we're doing great
we're going to have a tremendous victory, but when i have a perfect call, think of it, 33 what they get away with, and don't forget, i came to washington having been there for a very, very few times in my life
so i say, look at this, and i'm riding down pennsylvania avenue, and i pass a hotel that i built, beautiful, and i said to the first lady, who is doing a fantastic job
true, true
so, i think i might have been in washington 17 times in my life, and i'm riding down, and i look at the first lady and i say, melania, do you believe it
i'm president, look, can you believe it
and i never saw so many motorcycles and i never saw so many police cars and we're going so fast in the opposite direction
it's not supposed to go that way, and i say this is cool
we can get used to this
this is ok
but i was thinking to myself when i said that
i said look, so, i get elected and i beat the bush dynasty, ok
i get elected and i beat, and again, with no experience, i didn't have experience
i have tremendous world experience, but i didn't have political experience
so, i get elected and we beat the clinton dynasty, right
and then, we beat barack-hussein obama, and whatever the hell dynasty that is
so, we have 24 years of people putting people into office
so, we have tens of thousands of people and some are very nice, but i get stuck with a lot of people that i don't want, tens of thousands
and i'll tell you we're getting it right
we have a great cabinet, we're doing things that no president has ever done before, and you've got to be very, very happy
you've got to be very, very happy because we have done more already
and hopefully, we have   i'll say this to drive them crazy
hopefully, we have at least another five years to go, at least
because you know they think, you know, he's not leaving, he's not
now, we have five years and we're going to make it a great five years
but you know what
we have done really, we have done much more than i promised
if you look at the tax cuts, if you look at the military, if you look at the va, if you look at, right to try, right to try, how good is that
right to try, things that for years and years and years they've been trying to get passed
but when i have a perfect phone call with all of the horrible things that they've done with the president of ukraine, they tried to claim that it's an impeachable offense, and one of the women said this morning, excuse me
i'm voting for trump
i happen to read the transcript of his phone call and he did absolutely nothing wrong, and i'm voting   can you imagine
they take this perfect call and they want to impeach your president
and you know what, here's the good news
we have more support in the republican party, kevin mccarthy, meadows, i'm going to introduce a couple of them
jim jordan, great champion wrestler
we've got a couple of them here
i'm going to save that
steve scalise who's been incredible, so many
elise, how's elise doing, right, new star
no, no, it's incredible
devin nunes, how good is he, devin
and so many more, i don't want to get into it, but i tell you what, a lot of stars are being made, and i was just told backstage, our poll numbers are through the roof because people don't like watching this scam
they don't like watching it
they don't like watching it
they've got a sick puppy, shifty schiff
and they don't like seeing what's happening and a lot of democrats are saying, one of them was in today in detroit
i believe and she's like a d, democrat 30, that means, in other words, that's not one that we're going to work too hard to get, but you never know what happens, right
and she came out and said, essentially, hey, i'm not here to impeach the president
but what they're really saying is they don't like the position they're in and they're going to like it less and less, and we're going to take it right up to november 3rd, 2020
we're going to take back the house
we're going to take it back
so, the president of ukraine declared that there was no pressure put on me
now, he's the only one that matters
there was no pressure
he said it all different ways, there was no pressure
they don't even know what they're talking about
it's a scam
it's a hoax
the ukrainian foreign minister stated, and i quote, ambassador sondland did not tell us, and certainly, did not tell me about a connection between the assistance and the investigation, he's never told them
i have never had a direct link between investigations and security assistance
ok, what that means, do you know what it means
it means we did zero, we did nothing wrong nothing
we did nothing wrong
a great senator from wisconsin, ron johnson, a supporter of us from day one, he's a great guy of ukraine
he said who met privately with   and he met with president zelensky, and he said at no time during that meeting was there any mention by the president
you know what i'm talking about, right
at no time was there any mention or anything that we're feeling, that they were feeling any pressure in return for military aid
it's the craziest thing
they took this   look, here's what happened
they were devastated by what happened with this mueller witch hunt deal, and then, mueller testified
how did he do what he testified to
how did he do
it wasn't too good but they were devastated
they say this is a disaster
now, they say, give us anything, we'll impeach him
let him go to the refrigerator and pick an orange
we'll go to   from florida, yeah, pick an orange from florida
we're going to impeach him
we'll impeach him, but during the time period and issue, the u
government officials held many meetings with ukraine and never once never did ukraine or the officials say anything that was wrong
then, all of a sudden, i'm hearing about a phone call, and then fortunately, they had transcribers
hey, how about if i didn't   with these lowlifes to talk, how about, if we didn't have a transcript
so, all i'm saying, i don't want to go into it too long, but all i'm saying is that, it's a terrible hoax
last week, sondland testified that i told him quote
what do you want from ukraine
i said i want nothing
there's a quote
i want no quid pro quo
i want nothing, tell president zelensky to do the right thing, to do what he ran on, that's what he said, ok
and everybody knows, everybody knows
a lot of people heard shifty make up a story where he actually made up what i said, but these are the facts
the case closed, game over, turn off the television
as soon as he said that, it was like, turn off the television
so, we're going to keep going
i've had republicans come up to me, sir
can we keep this sucker going a little bit longer
we've never seen anything like it with the polls
i said, let's get it over with, but you know what, we're stuck with dealing with very very sick and corrupt people
that's what it is
the failed washington establishment is trying to stop me because i'm fighting for you and because we're winning
it's very simple
they're attacking me because i'm exposing a rigged system that enriched itself at your expense, and i'm restoring government of, by, and for the people
and if you want to see what corruption looks like, then take a look, no further than slow, sleepy joe
i don't know what's going on with joe
when sleepy joe was in charge of ukraine policy, his son, i call him where is he
where's hunter
where is he
what happened to hunter
where's hunter
his son received millions and millions of dollars from a ukrainian energy company without a great   you know the reputation of that company, despite knowing absolutely nothing about energy
what business are you in, sir
the mailbox business
oh, bail bond, well, that's   do you know hunter biden
do you know sleepy joe
bail bond, whoa
so, did you ever work on energy before
you know more about energy, he said, no, then, hunter, you know much more
despite being thrown out of the navy for lots of different reasons, we won't even go into it
he made no money, zero, nothing, and then, all of a sudden, his father becomes vice president, and he's making millions and millions, and then, he goes to china, where, by the way, we're getting very close to a very good deal, and if we don't make it that's fine, but we're getting very close
obviously, hunter is dealing with different people that i'm dealing with in china because after 10 minutes, he walked away for his fund with $1
5 billion
i will tell you, i said to everybody, these are different people that i'm dealing with in china
they got much softer
that was what his father was vice president, and now, they're finding other countries
likewise, i will tell you something, the fake news doesn't want to bring it up
they protect everybody
the democrats, the democrats on stage don't bring it up
do you notice
they never bring it up, but if you should make it, it'll be brought up for about 75% of the time that we're debating because nobody ever got away with a scam like that, all right, nobody
but day after day, we're exposing the depravity, dishonesty, and sickness of the corrupt washington establishment, and let me tell you, they're rough, they're dirty players
they come at you from every side, they're coming at me from new york, they're coming at me from new jersey, they're coming at me from every democratic state like nobody's ever seen
rush limbaugh said, and sean hannity that he doesn't know a man or woman in the world that could take the crap that president trump is taking
and i understand it
i understand it
and at the same time, be a great president because nobody in the first three years of a presidency has done what we've done
nobody   nobody, that's very important
but with your help, we're going to complete the mission and we are draining the swamp indeed
on election day 2020, the crazy democrats are going down in a landslide and that landslide is going to start right here in the great state of florida
thank you
so, here's something that you just read about, right
we like these updated stories, don't we
don't we like these   something that happened a few days ago
we talk, who else does this
most people they took and they read, and you know, everybody falls asleep, nobody comes
i say, darling, how was he
about somebody else, hopefully, it was so boring
it was so boring, and you know, i always say being presidential is so easy, ladies and gentlemen
thank you
but it's so easy
doing what i do is tough
i said i like it
if you don't like it, if you don't love what you're doing, forget it
it's not going to work
i do, i do like it, and what we're doing together, has never been done before, never been done
but i like telling these life stories that happened a little while ago
they don't have to put them in speeches that you read stuff and people fall asleep
but on saturday, you saw what happened
the white house physician called me and said, sir, you're home today
if i want it, meaning me, i could do some of the physical
you know in january we go for the physical
i never took physicals before, now, every year of us to take a physical, but it's important
it's good, right
it's good
because january is a very busy month for you, sir
i said you're right
so, what do you want to do
i said ok, let's go
so, we went to walter reed medical center, fantastic place, incredible doctors, and i was there for just a short while
i visited a family of a soldier being operated on, an incredible family, his son was in serious condition, and i stayed with him for a little while
i toured the hospital
i took a little part of my physical, so, i don't have to take it in january, very simple, and i got back into the motorcade, the car
we have many, many cars and trucks and ambulances, unfortunately, and lots of different things, right
we also have like a bus or whatever the hell carries these crazy people
and the press follows me wherever i go, unfortunately
you know in the old days, i could sneak out and go someplace
today, these people are crazy, so, so, the press is   everybody's there
we start, it's like a beautiful thing
if you like lots of cars and lots of action, but the press is following me
so, i hadn't even gotten back to the white house and that stupid, corrupt, horrible cnn,  whose ratings are terrible, by the way, and others, and others, whose ratings, by the way, cnn ratings are terrible
oops, look, their light just went off
the light just went off
i shouldn't do it, i shouldn't do it because we lose a small audience when that happens
no, but they'll report it
so, here i am
so, i'm there for a very routine, little, simple physical, and by the way, if there's something wrong, i got to tell you
i want to tell you about it because it's very big stuff, but i was there just to save a little time in january
i feel great
hey, let me tell you, if i didn't feel great, i wouldn't be ranting and raving to 21,000 - 22,000 people with lots of people outside
i can tell you
so, i get back in, and now, it's a short drive
we arrive at the white house and i heard that they said, it came out in the media, including some of the very, very dishonest people that are here today
look at that
it's like the academy awards used to be, used to be
you know the academy awards was big until they started hitting us
now, they've gone down the tubes, but it's like the academy awards used to be
look at all those lights back there
but i'm getting out of the car and somebody said, sir, you ok
i said, yeah
what's that all about
i go a few feet further and another security
sir, sir, are you ok, sir
i said, yeah, i'm fine
what's   what's going on
nobody's ever asked me that
you know normally, i work
these are the greatest people, the military, the secret service they're the greatest, but they don't ever say, sir, are you ok
and i could see he was like troubled
he likes me you know and i walk another few feet, sir
i hope you're, ok, sir
i say what the hell is going on
and then, they said i had a massive heart attack, nothing to joke about
but they said i had a massive heart attack
i had a heart attack and it wasn't true
they knew it wasn't true
they were with me
if you've had a heart attack, you don't leave the hospital shortly after you get that
you stay in the hospital for a little while, like, about six weeks maybe
so, we had the people call, doesn't mean anything, because they're totally corrupt people, and they said, it's untrue
so, they brought it down from a massive, unbelievable heart attack
you know, it's very dangerous for them to do because the world, believe it or not, the rest of the world and the leaders, like and respect your president
we don't want to hear this and i like them
it's very sad
so then, instead, they brought it down a notch
they said you went into the hospital and it's true
i didn't wear a tie
why would i wear a tie
if the first thing they do is they take off your shirt, sir, and show us that gorgeous chest
shall   we want to see
we've never seen a chest quite like it
no, but seriously, why would i put   i mean, i put the tie on, and then, we're there in 20 minutes, i take it off for the physical
but they said, he wasn't wearing a tie, which is pretty unusual for me, honestly
i should have worn a tie
maybe, it's not their fault
you never apologize but they said he wasn't wearing a tie
this is a sign of a massive heart attack
but we called up and our people did a good job screaming he's fine
there was nothing happened, they didn't believe it
they brought it down to tremendous chest pains
he had chest pains
one of them said, there were tremendous, oh, tremendous
the only one that didn't know it was me, i'm the only one
and then, they said like a little bit later, he's staying over in the hospital, but they knew i came back
they were with me
they were with me
they saw me get into the car
they saw us leave and they said i stayed at the great walter reed hospital
so, we said, no, the chest pains aren't true, but they kept on reporting it
we couldn't get them to stop because they're corrupt, crooked, and we don't have freedom of the press
we have a very dishonest press
we have a very dishonest press
so then, on monday, i flew to texas, the great state of texas, and i opened up an apple computer plant
they make the new beautiful mac, whatever
and i met with tim cook and did lots of work, and it's a long flight and i got back many hours later
it was late night, and i said you know what, i just set a record because yesterday or the day before, they said i had a massive heart attack, and now, a day later, i'm traveling to texas to open up this big plant
i don't know not too many people have ever done that one before
so, i just want to tell you that so much, as an example, we had a great two weeks watching these crooked politicians, not giving us due process, not giving us lawyers, not giving us the right to speak, and destroying their witnesses, it fell apart
those were their witnesses
we weren't allowed any rights
we had for the first time in the history of our country, we had virtually, no rights or due process, and despite that, we won
but if you read the crooked new york times, if you read the washington post, which is just a horrible paper, you know, we don't have it anywhere in d
, anymore
we don't deliver it, we don't give it, we used to buy it, we don't do it
and in fact, i ended it in the nation because i want them to get correct news, not fake news, but they're bad people
so, what happens
what happens
is we go out, we win for the people, we keep winning
we won these last two weeks so solidly, but if you pick up the new york times, if you pick up this crazy washington post, you would have no idea we won
but you know what, the people knew it, and that's why and that's why they don't want to have this
they don't want to see it go on
it probably will because the people are nuts and nuts, and i really think probably, it's a good thing for us as a party because i think, it's going to just walk us right through that election, which is going to take place already in less than a year
so, we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific republican leaders and i want to just have run up on the stage, but they're stars and their warriors, just like those three guys we helped out
these are warriors in a different way, but they're up there and they're fighting for your president and they're fighting for your country and they love the state of florida, congressman, matt gaetz, come on up, matt
a man i just watched last night on television, he was fantastic
congressman, michael waltz
come on up, michael
get up here
billy posey, a great guy and a great fighter
billy, come up
come up, billy
gus bilirakis, gus, come on up, gus
and a man who is an incredibly brave guy, a friend of mine
somebody that's done a fantastic job, loves his state, brian mast, brian
i want to introduce attorney general and a friend of all of ours, who ran a great campaign, won easily, despite a lot of crooked stuff going on with those voting machines, a lot of bad stuff going on with those voting machines, attorney general, ashley moody
come on up, ashley
and by the way, a friend of mine, a great woman, a great person, former florida attorney general pam bondi, come up, pam
come up, pam
florida's cfo jimmy patronis
jimmy, come up, and lieutenant governor and somebody that really has become a star in this state, jeanette nunez
come up, jeanette
incredible people
and somebody that's one of the most popular governors anywhere in the country, and   true, true
he better not be more popular in florida than me, i'm never going to go
but here's a quick story, here's a quick
true
but here's a quick story
i shouldn't say it because i wouldn't want to say this but what the hell, right
so, you know ron's been a friend of mine for a long time
he was a congressman
he did an incredible job, always protecting me from the russia witch hunt and beyond, with these guys with matt and everybody
he'd be up an incredible race, and then, he ran against the democrat, who is supposed to be unbeatable
he got beaten badly, and now, this is one of the most popular governors
but i always thought ron was a little bit heavy, and then, one day i'm with him and i pat him on the shoulder, and i go whoa, that's strong
that's a lot of muscle there
my hand didn't sink in, like it does with a lot of people, and then, i see him without a shirt one day and this guy is strong and he's not fat
that's all power
that's all muscle
i want to tell you that, and i said ron, you're one of the few i say it to don't walk around with a jacket all the time take it off
people are going to see the real ron, but he's a great guy
he's a tough guy
he's a brilliant guy and he's our governor and i'm very proud
when we got involved with ron, a lot of people were saying, do you think he can make it
i said he's going to make it because he's a champ, he's a winner, and i want you to say a few words, ron
thank you
great people and i'll say
thanks to republican policies, we have the hottest economy anywhere in the world that it's not even close
unemployment has reached its lowest level in more than 51 years
in the last 12 months, florida has seen the second-largest payroll increase of any state in the nation
people are making money
african-american unemployment has again just reached its lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country
hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have also recently achieved their lowest levels at any time in the history of our country
african-american poverty has reached an all-time historic low
wages are rising fast and blue-collar florida workers saw their wages grow nearly 4
5% in just the last 12 months
people are finally starting to see
for 21 years, they were going backwards
people would work, 21 years ago when i was running first, 24 years ago
people would have tremendous problems
they would make more money many, many years ago, decades ago
then, they were making three years ago and they'd have two and three jobs
that's not happening anymore
you can go and choose your job
if you don't like what you're doing, if you don't like, if you're not having a good time getting up in the morning, all you do is find a new job, and you'll get more money, most likely
you've never been so successful
you have never been successful like you've been right now
never, never even   and this state has never had this success, and by the way, you had a great governor previous to ron, rick scott who's now your senator, and marco rubio, a great guy
we have two great guys, marco and rick, two great guys
they love this state
the median-income under president bush rose $400 over an eight-year period, now think of this
so, eight years, $400
under president obama, it rose $975 over an eight-year period
so, you have $400 eight years, $975 eight years, and under trump in less than three years, it rose $5,000
but, but that's $5,000, but now you can add to the $5,000 from tax cuts, regulatory cuts, and energy savings
you know we're the no
1 in the world
we can add another $5,000
so, it's $400, it's $975 eight years, eight years, and less than three years, $10,000 median
nobody's going to beat that
nobody's going to beat that and we're going to keep it going
we have tremendous untapped potential
we ended the last administration's war on american energy
the united states is now the no
1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
the democrats want to close it up
i don't know what they're going to use
i guess little tiny windmills, they don't like the big ones
they kill too many birds and we're reversing decades of ruinous trade policies that demolished one in four and the number is actually now greater than that when they look back
florida manufacturing jobs, remember, you need a magic wand, you're never going to bring it back
that was president obama, you need a magic wand after the twin disasters of nafta, horrible
one of the worst trade deals ever made and china's entrance into the wto, the world trade organization
for years, bought and paid for politicians took money from special interests to ship your jobs to other countries
their campaign coffers got full and the lives of hardworking americans were destroyed
you know what happened all these companies left
they left you with the jobs
they left you with nothing, but you're having the greatest year, in florida, you're having the greatest year in the country that we've ever had before
good morning
well, it certainly does
and they were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top
and everybody knows it
and now we're going to find out
you have bull durham, who's supposed to be the toughest
i've never met him
never spoke to him
but he's supposed to be the smartest and th­­e best
and he works for bill barr, who is a great attorney general
we would have maybe invented this thing a lot sooner had he been there originally
but you have some people that are great people, now, and   patriotic people
they love our country
this was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country
this was an overthrow attempt at the presidency
they tried to overthrow the presidency
this is a disgrace
but what   i'm not surprised to see
it's just starting to come out
i think this is nothing compared that what you'll see over the next couple of weeks
these people are sick
so my conversation was a perfect conversation
the ukrainian president said, what are they talking about
there must think we're nuts in this country
and this conversation was flawless
it was appropriate
it was perfect
it was nice
it was everything
and they even said that
they came out and said it
now, compare that   as they try to impeach, and by the way, they've looked like fools over the last five days, as these interviews were   these were their witnesses
this was the best they've got
adam schiff is a sick puppy
he is a   it's pretty incredible
now, what you're going to see, i predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal
but i guess that's the biggest, because what's more important than a political
i think you're going to see things that are going to be incredible, if it's done right
and i purposely stay out
i tell bill barr to handle everything
i wouldn't have to, i could get very much involved, but i purposely don't
and i haven't
and you know what
it's better that way, i guess
i don't have any obligation, legally, to do that, but i've let them handle it
so you have a fisa report coming out, which the word is it's historic
that's what the word is
that's what i hear
and if it's historic, you're going to see something
then perhaps even more importantly, you have durham coming out shortly thereafter
he's the u
attorney, and he's already announced it's criminal
and we'll see what happens
but
i'll tell you what
you have a lot of very, very bad people
and, you know, a lot of people say, deep state
i don't like to use the word deep state
so i just say they're really bad and sick people
you're dealing at the highest levels of government
they were spying on my campaign
this is my opinion
i said it a long time ago
remember when i put out a tweet and i talked about the wiretapping in quotes, meaning modern day version of whatever wiretapping may be
and all hell broke loose
personally, i think it goes all the way
okay
because i think it's impossible
and, you know, you look at the previous administration that   they went after like a few
and she was getting them by   at a level nobody's ever even imagined before, and it had nothing to do with her
now, i think this goes to the highest level
i hate to say it
i think it's a disgrace
they thought i was going to win, and they said, how could we stop him
they wrote up the phony fake dossier, the disgusting fake dossier, and they tried to have it put out prior to the election
and just to show how incompetent they were, they spent millions and millions of dollars
hillary clinton paid for it and the democrats, a lot of it had to do, they say, with ukraine
it's very interesting
it's very interesting
they have this server right, from the dnc democratic national committee
the fbi went in and they told him, get out of here
you're not getting it
we're not giving it to you
they gave the server to crowd strike or whatever it's called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy ukrainian
and i still want to see that server
you know, the fbi has never gotten that server
that's a big part of this whole thing
why did they give it to a ukrainian company
well, that's what the word is
and that's what i asked actually in my phone call, you know
i mean, i asked that very point blank because we're looking for corruption
there's tremendous corruption we're looking for
why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there's this kind of corruption
right
if you look at my call, i said, you know, corruption   i think he said it to me
he's looking
he got elected on the basis of corruption
and i also, by the way, going back to that, why isn't germany putting up money
why isn't france putting up money
why isn't all of the european nations   why are they putting up
you have the european union and they're benefited in a lot more by
paying than we are
well, mr
president, can i ask you
it's like a massive wall
yes
why aren't they putting up money
how come it's always the united states that puts up money, the suckers
why is it always the united states
and these are the questions i ask and continue to ask him
well, first of all, brian, i haven't struggled because i've done more in the first two and a half years than any president in the history of our country
and almost everybody admits it
between rebuilding our military, the biggest tax cut in history
regulation
good
well, wait a second
two supreme court justices
within a few weeks, we'll have one hundred and eighty-two federal judges
it's a record
so i've done more than anybody that ever had
the position to  but they haven't made it pleasant
they're bad people
they hurt a lot of innocent people
people came down here, they got served subpoenas by mueller and the crew
and they went through two and a half years
they found nothing
so why would you say that
i think we've had the most productive presidency ever for the first two and a half years
but it doesn't mean that it was pleasant
i can't tell you that
i can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened
and when you look at strzok and page with the insurance policy, where, you know   the two lovers, the two great lovers from the fbi
where he's saying, oh, she's going to win 100 million to nothing, but just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy
well, that means, you know, we're going to take him down
we're going to take down the president
you wouldn't even believe this is possible
but the insurance policy is a very big find
finding that text
and the only reason we found it was they didn't want to use their private servers for a very bad reason
okay
so they use the public server
they use the fbi server
so here's the thing
we have so many   regardless of what's coming out, okay
the information that we have now is beyond belief already
but what they have coming out, i hear, is historic
that's the way it was explained
i heard some stories
of course the fake news will try and downplay it, but i don't think you can downplay this
fake news is part of it
you know, the democrats and the fake news, they're one and the same
they will downplay it because i like   i see these hearings where we have a great day
and then you pick up the phony new york times, which is a total phony paper   i don't read it anywhere, you can't read it
it's not even   it has no relationship to the truth
and you read a story that took place, and they don't tell you what happened
they only put in the bad
they don't put in the good
same thing with the washington post
it's a phony paper
we don't have it in the white house
and we saved a lot of money
okay
no, not at all
and let me tell you, he's a sick puppy
he's so sick
this guy is so   i've been going through it for two and a half years about russia
i've been tougher on russia than any president in history
but for two and a half years, i've had to listen
this was their talking point, trump and russia
and if you take a look at it, just look at the facts
even look at what i've done for ukraine by giving them tank busters, by giving them stuff
and obama would send pillows and sheets
he wouldn't send anything else
it's the whole thing
now schiff, remember this
he makes it all up
he's sick
there's something wrong with him
so he made up my phone call
he made it up
he made up a phone call
and then when i released it, everybody was embarrassed
and crazy nancy pelosi, who, by the way, is going to go down as the worst speaker in the history of the house of representatives, she hasn't done anything
well, she said she's like paralyzed
she cannot do anything
i predict she won't do usmca, because richard trumka, who's a good guy, but a big union guy   only cares about a union
richard trumka has her mortified
she won't do usmca and everybody in the country wants it, the farmers, the manufacturers
but richard trumka has her   like he plays her like a fiddle
and i predict you won't even do it
she   and, by the way, she's got such pressure on her to do it
all she has to do is put it to a vote
she's holding it for six months
it's growing dust on her desk, and mexico and canada calling, saying, what's going on
where is our agreement
they signed it
they're all set
yeah, well, that's total nonsense
i do want   always corruption
i say that to anybody
why should we give money to a country that's known corrupt
it's a very corrupt country
i mean, i love the people in ukraine
i know ukrainian people
they're great people
but it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world
now, with this guy who, by the way, i hardly know him
okay
yeah
i've spoken to him a few times
how about the guy with the telephone
how about that one
i guarantee you that never took place
he said he's sitting there listening to me
i spoke so few times to him
but the guy yesterday on the telephone, david holmes, yes, i heard the conversation
well, i have really good hearing
and i've been watching guys for 40 years make phone calls
and i can't hear when   you could be two feet away
i can't hear people making calls
i can't hear the other side, the phones up in the air
unless you have it on the speaker phone, you can't do it
that was a total phony deal
that was a phone   you know, again
call it deep state
call it
call it anti-trump people
well, first of all, that's not true
okay
number one, it's absolutely not true
now, then, you have to say, if you saw joe biden's
joe biden is corrupt
it's not true what he said
now, what he said, also, is, there was no quid pro quo
i want nothing
remember was trending number one
i want nothing
he said that when he was questioned
he, and by the way, check out his lawyers, they're hillary clinton lawyers
this guy has hillary clinton, the lawyers, their democrats
but he's sitting there   sondland
yes
he's sitting there with clinton lawyers
they're passing him notes all the time
and he didn't put the most important phrase in his 22-page statement that he read
the most important phrase was, i want nothing   twice i said it   i want nothing
i want nothing
i want no quid pro quo
have president zelensky do whatever is right
something to that effect
and they didn't put that in
that was the end of him
i turned off the television
that's what he said
now, with all of that, of course, you have to look at corruption
are we going to be sending massive amounts of money to a country, and they're corrupt, and they steal the money, and it goes into everybody's bank accounts
so you have to look at that
and i will tell you this about joe biden
i never said it specifically on him
but i watched joe biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off
and he was prosecuting that company
and the kid who'd never made 10 cents in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars a day, i mean, you tell me
this is a guy who got thrown out of the navy dishonorably
he gets thrown out of the navy shortly thereafter and makes no money
went through, made no money
and all of the sudden
becomes vp is making millions and millions of dollars, not only from there, but from china
so, mr
president, the accusation is this, that you're using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in joe biden
and you say, you do say, i wanted to hold up that aid because of corruption, but you also have the phone calls
well, thank you very much
thank you everybody
what a group
what a group
what a group
i also want to thank a true american legend, and a beloved national hero, rush limbaugh
thank you, rush
you know, i don't know if you know it or not
he's got like 39 million people listening
he's been   from day one, he's been so incredible
good times, bad times, he doesn't waver because he's tough as hell
he makes like   they tell me he makes like $50 million a year
and it may be   that may be on the low side
so if anybody wants to be a nice conservative talk show host, it's not a bad living
i will say
but i have to say, he's a very unique guy and he's a great man and he's been a great friend
so thank you to rush
thank you
and let me begin by wishing you a beautiful   look, do you remember this
do you remember they were trying to take christmas out of christmas
do you remember
they didn't want to let you say merry christmas
you would go around, you'd see department stores that have everything   red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows
everything was there, but they wouldn't say merry christmas
they're all saying merry christmas again
you remember
i went through that, during the campaign
they going to say merry christmas again
and they are
that's the least of it, too, because we got a lot of things that they're doing that they weren't doing
and we got to keep the country   we got to keep what we're doing
please sit down
we got to keep     we have plenty of time
it's a saturday night
see, if i were sleepy joe, i'd say, it's a saturday night in ohio
we have plenty of time
and he wouldn't say it that way
they'd say, no, no, we're in florida
we're in florida
he's only done that about four times, where
it's a saturday night
it's great to be in delaware
no, we're iowa
you know, if you're speaking and you do that, it's over
you can't make   you could be winston churchill and the speech is no good
once you do that, it's over and he does it a lot
there's something going on up there
and there's something going on with the rest of them
i mean, they want to take away everything
they want to destroy what we've built
but i'm thrilled to be here tonight with thousands of proud, patriotic young americans at turning point usa student action summit
incredible, the job that charlie's done
you're the fearless young leaders and warriors who stare down the hatred of the radical left and bravely fight for our liberty, our values, and our god-given freedom
each of you is a fighter on the frontlines of defending our way of life
and i am profoundly grateful to all of you
the whole country is
and by the way, your crowds are getting bigger and bigger and bigger
i see on television, where charlie had a deal going on where they had 4- or 5,000 people standing outside
i get a little angry because that's supposed to be only me
but they had thousands of people on one of the colleges where they couldn't get in, and you have that
you have that
we're sort of different
we don't do it quite the other   you know, we do the nice way
but the truth is, you're tougher
you're smarter
you're far more elite
don't you love it when they say the elite
they're referring to the others   the elite
no, no, you're the elite
the elite
but i want to congratulate my friend, charlie kirk     for mobilizing students on more than 1,500 high school and college campuses all across the country
amazing
and i see my son don is standing with charlie
they like each other
and kimberly, did don speak
did you speak, don
because i heard   did you speak
oh, tomorrow
oh, i   i'm going to come
oh, i want to put pressure on him
you got to see how they handle it
i'll sit there and i'll say, come on, let's go
let's go
no, people love him
they love him
they love him
he's a good   he's a good young guy
he's a little   i'm a little prejudiced
you know, he's my son
but he's a good guy, and he loves this country a lot
and he loves you
so thank you very much
thank you, kimberly
great job, kimberly
the radical left doesn't stand a chance against young conservatives who put america first
we're putting america first
you know, we weren't     america was not considered   these people, what they were doing to our country was just unbelievable
we're putting america first
and you know what
other leaders should put their country first
why not
what are you going to do, put it second
put it ninth
they should   i tell them
because it sounds very insulting when you say, we put america first
i say, do you know what
you should put your country first, too
but if we put america first, and they put their country first, we win every single time
and we're joined by a man that i've gotten to know and respect
and he's highly, highly   this is a very capable person who has really developed a voice that you rarely develop as such a young person, and so new to this whole crazy political game
but i'm new too, dan crenshaw
i'm new too
where is dan crenshaw
where is he
where is dan
you are great
thank you, dan
thank you, dan
what a voice he's developed
what a voice
thank you, dan
he did it quickly
some guys are in congress there   they have 40 years, they don't have your voice
thank you
and i don't mean the voice, speaking
i mean people listening to what you say
thank you very much
great job
and, by the way, i have to say, while dan is here
what kind of great support did we have from those incredible congressmen and women this week
they got up and they spoke and they were fantastic
and i guess the vote was like 196, or something, to nothing
we had three democrats coming to our side
so we have to say it was a bipartisan vote
you call that bipartisan
hey, no republican went to their side
we had like 195, dan, to nothing, right
something like that   195 to nothing
you don't see that
you don't see that
what a great group of people
come here, dan
what do you have
i said, this better be good, dan
that took a long time
i said, dan, what the hell is it
he said, it's a no vote on impeachment day
that was a no vote
i'll save that, dan
i'll save that, dan
well, we had a lot of no votes
and the senate now is   how about that deal, where they had nothing
there's no crime
there's no nothing
how do you impeach
you had no crime
even their people said there was no crime
in fact, there's no impeachment
there's no   their own lawyers said there's no impeachment
what are we doing here
the world is watching
crazy nancy
she's crazy
no, no, so now she says   you know, she has no case
she has no case
so let's not submit it
that's good, right
that's good
but you know what
so unfair
it's so unfair
she has no case
did they look bad
they got up   the same thing, the constitution
they are violating the constitution totally
totally
they're violating the constitution
in the meantime, our polls have gone through the roof
and the senate, like the house   we've done great work together
you know, today, with the judges
last week, we did 13 judges   13 extra
we're going to talk about it in a second
but we're doing like no other party has done in the first, think of it, less than three years, and what we've done
last night was so exciting, with the national defense bill
the greatest military ever
ever
new jets, new ships, new rockets, new missiles
all made in the usa, folks
made in the usa
but as we near the end of another extraordinary year, we celebrate america's incredible comeback, and that's what it is
our country was down
we were depressed
we were depleted
our military was so, so down and so out
i mean, i could tell you stories, and i won't tell you because it's embarrassing to tell you, but we've rebuilt it
two and a half trillion dollars
somebody said, well, that's bad for the budget
let me tell you about budgets
i'm a big budget person, but when it comes to the military, there is no budget
there is no budget
there's no budget when it comes to the military
somebody says, well, we're doing really badly in the war
we don't have enough ammunition
but we're losing the war
but you know, we had a good budget last year
no, it's   you have people that think that way
you know, it doesn't work that way
we're so powerful, militarily, now, especially at the end of another six months
this stuff is all pouring in
brand-new jets, the most incredible stealth jets, the f-35 fighters, the f-18, the f-16s, the     nobody has ever seen what we're doing
ships, submarines   i won't even tell you about the submarine
the most powerful ships in the world
the most powerful boats
the most powerful weapon in the world is our submarines, and they're under construction
and we just hope to god that we never have to use them
we hope that we never have to use them, and we do
and the way we won't have to use them is if the power is so great that nobody's ever going to say, gee… you know, we learned that a long time ago
we learned that in high school
we learned it in grade school, right
but we will have   and we have now overwhelming power, and just hope we don't have to use it
our economy is booming
wages are rising
crime is falling
poverty is plummeting
and our nation is stronger and more powerful right now than it has ever been before
and we've achieved more in this month alone than almost any president has achieved in eight years in office, if you think about it   if you think what we've done
we reached an agreement to replace one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world
nafta
remember when all the companies were leaving our country, charlie, and they were going to mexico and a couple of other places, frankly
but they were leaving, leaving us with no jobs, no income, empty factories all over the country
you go to ohio, you go to new england   you saw that
it was like a empty   everything was gone
nafta
remember a certain man said it was that sucking feeling
you know what that   do you remember who said that
it was that
right
he's a student
it was ross perot
he said it's got that sucking feeling
all of our jobs, all of our companies were being sucked out of our country
we're replacing nafta and the nafta disaster with the brand-new usmca, which is an incredible deal
except to globalists
you know, you have some globalists that don't like it
you know why
because they think it's okay when a company closes its doors and opens up in mexico or another country
they think it's okay, as long as there's a company someplace
i say, no, no, i want the companies to build our products here
okay
we don't need those deals
i mean, these are people that   they're called globalists
anybody a globalist here
i don't know, you know
we tried that
not too many globalists, i don't think, in this room
i think, frankly, once they understand what's happening, there aren't too many globalists, period
but the only one that would be opposed   and i think nafta passed by a number that was incredible
there were only, what
forty-one votes against it
and people, for a trade deal, that's almost impossible
we got labor support
we got support, and the farmers are going to do so well
and what it does
and i asked for one thing, i said, look, i want to make it very prohibitively expensive for a company to leave our country, go to another country   let me be nice   go to another country… you know, 32 percent of our car industry has gone to mexico over the last 20 years
can you imagine
32 percent
and it was heading there
they going to have all of it
and that's about the end, folks
that's about the end
so we're saving the american auto industry, keep   creating   and, very importantly, creating countless number of american jobs, and opening vast new opportunities for america's farmers, growers, and manufacturers
for years, politicians came and went, promising to replace nafta
remember that
all the time
it's probably why i'm here
probably
i was honored about 10 years ago   long before i thought of coming down that beautiful escalator with our great future first lady
but nafta is probably   i used to go   i just used to say   i was honored in michigan
i just left michigan
we just had   they had me man of the year in michigan
and i made a speech and a lot of people were shaken up
they said, why are you allowing this to happen
mexico is taking all of your car companies and so is canada
canada sells us tremendous numbers of cars that they didn't used to sell
why are you letting this happen
and it was a rough speech
but the truth is, that was the way i felt, and i've never changed
i've never changed
and the new usmca stops that
but the politicians, they talked about it, but they never did anything about it
absolutely nothing
and they just kept selling america out
but where other administrations failed, we delivered
so i guess we had, don, 385   or something like that   to 41
something like that
oh, there's laura ingraham
how good is laura
come here, laura
how good is laura
you know, now the cnn     the cnn cameras   all the cameras just turned off
that's okay
they don't want to promote laura
she's got   what a job she does
and, by the way, look, it's still always about the ratings
her ratings are through the roof
congratulations
through the roof
she's great
she's great
great person, too
we also took the toughest-ever action against china
and as a result     we just achieved a breakthrough on the trade deal and we'll be signing it very shortly
they're already buying billions and billions of dollars of products   agricultural products
i spoke to president xi yesterday
and you know, he's also coming down   and clamping down, laura, on fentanyl
i said you got to do that
fentanyl coming out of china
they're clamping down, and they're clamping down strongly
that's a big thing
it came out of china and it hasn't been   hasn't been good
it's been terrible, actually
and i said, you got to do that
and they have been doing it
they've been going very strongly against it
we've had a big   it's had a big impact
yesterday i signed into law the largest-ever investment in our military   700   it's $738 billion
and i also officially created the sixth branch of the u
armed forces, the space force
and i'll tell you   you know, i'd go, and a lot of times   a lot of times, i'll say something, and you're like a poll
you're like a free poll for me, okay
it's true
i'd ask questions like, what do you like better for this campaign
'maga'   'make america great again,' which we always like
we're never     or 'keep america great
' and it's very surprising
so normally, most candidates like, you know, the people that don't know too much   they'll go and do a   they'd hire a pollster
the pollster goes to about 92 people
then they wonder why the polls are wrong
how come the polls were wrong
in my case, they do a poll and then they add 10 or 12 percent now to it
they've learned that
took them a little while to figure that one out
but you know what
i do it
and i say   look, i have these room full of incredible people   i say, what do you like better
now, i'm a little superstitious
i'll never give up make america great again
i can't do that, dan, right
i can't do it, dan
so i'm never going to do that
so we'll have it
but i was thinking, we have the highest stock market in the history of our country, by far
one hundred and thirty-five times, since i'm president   which is less than three years
substantially   well, you know, it's january 20th
that's a long way away, meaning not too long
but think of it
one hundred and thirty-five times, we broke a record
we had a stock market record
and that to me is not a stock market record
it's a record for 401 [k)s
it's a record of people owning stock
it's a record of jobs, jobs, jobs
(applause] so we have this great country
our military is rebuilt
we've never done better than we're doing right now and our country is respected again
and i said, well, wait a minute
if i say 'make america great again,' that's like we're continuing
we just set the record in the history of our country
hey, excuse me, african american   terrence   african american   they all know him
african american unemployment is at the lowest level it's ever been
hispanic american employ-   right
right
hispanic american unemployment
lowest level ever
asian american
lowest level ever
by the way, women
women
women
i failed you
i failed you   lowest level in 71 years
i'm sorry
i failed
but, remember this, you're going to have   very soon, you're going to have historic
lowest in 71 years
african american
hispanic american
asian american
so, and poverty levels are the best numbers they've ever been for african american, for hispanic american
for young african americans, our numbers on employment are the best they've ever been
so, i mean, we've done great
so i'm saying, make america great again
well, we've already made it
we've had such an impact
so, in a way, it's sort of competed with the real message   right
of what we're trying to do
so i said, you know, how about the   and i didn't pay millions of dollars for this
remember, hillary
she came up with a phrase
it was a disaster
they paid millions, then she had to change it one day into the campaign because i attacked it
i said   remember, i said, see it's all about her
they changed it
they paid a guy millions of dollars
he walked away   retired
i like to make it up myself
but keep america great, right
keep america great
so, let's have a poll
ready
we'll go first maga
and keep america great   i didn't like it
it was kag
but kag is now becoming cool, right
kag
kag
it's okay
so let's have a quick poll
you ready
but i see a lot of these keep america great hats
stand up, sir
look at that beautiful hat
got the higher front
gives you an extra couple of inches
that's not too bad, right
got that high front
got big letters
but keep america great
make america… okay, ready
who wants to keep make america great again
see
who wants to have keep america great
i'm telling you
i'm telling you
no, it's an amazing thing
one more shot at it
who wants make america great again
who wants keep america great
okay, so i've done that like 10 times with audiences   and smart audiences
this is my poll
thank you
you just saved me a million dollars
but i've done that like 10 times with big audiences, right
and every single time, it's keep america great
now, at the same time, none of us want to lose maga
so kimberly, don, charlie, all of you people, let's do both, okay
let's do both
because if you're superstitious   because, look, let's face it, when we came in, and when we started that campaign, like four years   even more than four years ago   make america great, that was probably the greatest phrase in the history of politics
really, right
so i'm a loyalist
i don't take things and just throw it to the side
but the truth is, our country is doing better than ever before
we're so respected again
leaders come in from other countries   prime ministers, presidents, kings, queens, dictators, in some cases   they just don't know they're dictators     or our people don't either   but they come in and they say, congratulations
what you've done is amazing
they're talking about all of us
and you know what
it is
but we'll keep both
we're going to probably be focusing a little bit more on keep america great, but we're going to keep both
this week, we confirmed 13 more highly qualified, brilliant federal judges to interpret the law as written     bringing the total to 187 federal judges right now
one hundred and eighty-seven, right
including two great supreme court justices, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh
you know, i was going around   yesterday, i heard about this, we just got 13 more
i think it might even be 15 yesterday
but they always say judges are the most important thing a president can do
and i disagree, i think defense   okay, you got to have a country, right
so i always think defense and all of that
but judges are right up there   probably, maybe number two
and maybe   i mean, people say it's the single-most important thing you do
judges, and especially, obviously, supreme court justices
so we have a number that can never be surpassed
we could have more than 50 percent of the judges in the united states
and one of the things that helped us so much is that president obama left us 142 federal judges
think of that
who would think that's possible
one hundred and forty-two federal judges
so we want to thank you very much, president obama
thank you
i mean, normally, when you leave office, you leave none
you leave none
that position is so power-   it's so important for the future of the country
i said to a gentleman   i came in, i said   by the way, first day   how many judges do i have to appoint
sir, you have 142
i said, you have to be kidding
right
you understand that, dan
can you believe he gave us 142
and i think now   i thought it was going to be   we'd be up to 182 by the end of the year
i was expecting to be at 182
yesterday, we hit 187
can you believe that
pretty amazing
and when the left-wing arsonists came for judge kavanaugh, we refused to back down and he refused to back down
and that's what they are
this week, i also signed legislation delivering record funding for our nation's amazing historically black colleges and universities
we secured full funding for our bold campaign to end the aids epidemic in america
who would have thought that could have been done
and to top it off, this week, the dow jones broke all of those records
the fact is, america is winning again
america is respected again
we're respected like never before, i can tell you that
and, you know, i went to nato and they weren't carrying their way
they weren't putting up the money
the press didn't want to talk about it
but there   oh, that's a lot of press back there
the fake news, yeah
it's a lot of press
it's always a lot of press
you know, with these guys, you can speak for weeks
if you make one little statement, they go after you
because you know why
they're fake news
you're right
but we are together, all of us   and you are such an important part of it
and a number of you will probably be here someday standing in this same position
i mean, it's where a great group of people are going to come, but we're saving the republic
but there's still much to be done
you know, we have to win this election
that was the most important election and i'll always   look, it'll always be   how exciting was that night, right
right
how exciting was that
remember that great evening in november of 2016
that night   and everybody was saying, we don't think he's going make it
they were so happy
we don't think he's going to make it
it's going to be a short evening for donald trump
they didn't call me president trump
going to be a short evening
because remember
the exit polls weren't good
do you know why they weren't good
did you know
because people would walk out   they'd walk out of the voting booth, who are you voting for
it's none of your business
and they had like 35 percent of the people said that
so they didn't count that
they didn't know that 100 percent of the people who said that voted for us, right
so they didn't count it
but we're in a battle of survival of this nation
we really are
when you look at these people talk, with their green new deal
but i don't want to knock it now, if you don't mind
i don't want to knock it
i knocked   i knocked the hell out of pocahontas
i got her down
i don't want to   too early
it's too early
they can change
i don't want say the green new deal
i think it's a wonderful thing
i do want to think about it
i want to study it closely
i want to see whether or not we should ever use airplanes again
how about the senator from hawaii
nasty
nasty
horrible
gee, what she says   what she says is so mean and angry
she's not the smartest person on the planet
she wants the green new deal, and then they informed her that that does not include airplanes
and you're the senator from hawaii
so they said, what are you going to do
and then they talked about building a train to hawaii, can you believe it
no, no, she wants it, even though you can't   you'll never get to hawaii again
say goodbye to hawaii
no, it's crazy, isn't it, though
but i don't want to knock it
all of these things have to be st-   it's too soon
it's too soon
let it go
let   let it seed
like   just like our great agenda has to seed like a tree
it has to seed
let the green new deal seed
and then about two months before the campaign ends, i will rip that sucker like you have
we'll let it seed, the green new deal
we'll have an economy based on wind
i never understood wind
you know, i know windmills very much
i've studied it better than anybody i know
it's very expensive
they're made in china and germany mostly   very few made here, almost none
but they're manufactured tremendous   if you're into this   tremendous fumes
gases are spewing into the atmosphere
you know we have a world, right
so the world is tiny compared to the universe
so tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything
you talk about the carbon footprint   fumes are spewing into the air
right
spewing
whether it's in china, germany, it's going into the air
it's our air, their air, everything   right
so they make these things and then they put them up
and if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters, your house is worth 50 percent of the price
they're noisy
they kill the birds
you want to see a bird graveyard
you just go
take a look
a bird graveyard
go under a windmill someday
you'll see more birds than you've ever seen ever in your life
you know, in california, they were killing the bald eagle
if you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years
a windmill will kill many bald eagles
it's true
and you know what
after a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off
that's true, by the way
this is   they make you turn it off after you   and yet, if you killed one they put you in jail
that's okay
but why is it okay for these windmills to destroy the bird population
and that's what they're doing
this is a conservative group, dan
no, but it's true
am i right
i'll tell you another thing about windmills
and i'm not   look, i like all forms of energy
and i think    really, they're okay in industrial areas
like you have an industrial plant, you put up a windmill   you know, et cetera, et cetera
i've seen the most beautiful fields, farms, fields   most gorgeous things you've ever seen, and then you have these ugly things going up
and sometimes they're made by different companies
you know, i'm like a perfectionist
i really built good stuff
and so you'll see like a few windmills made by one company
general electric
and then you'll see a few made by siemens, and you'll see a few made by some other guy that doesn't have 10 cents, so it looks like a   so you see all these windows, they're all different shades of color
they're like sort of white, but one is like an orange-white
it's my favorite color
orange
no, but   and you see these magnificent fields, and they're owned   and you know what they don't tell you about windmills
after 10 years, they look like hell
you know, they start to get tired, old
you got to replace them
a lot of times, people don't replace them
they need massive subsidy from the government in order to make it
it's really a terrible thing
and what they want to do is they want to get rid of all petroleum product
that means you basically won't have any factories in the united states
so tell me though, how are you going to win texas when you say, we're going to get rid of all petroleum, right
if you win   how about this guy, beto
beto
he was a beauty
beto came out   he's from texas
he came out against religion, he came out against guns, and he came out against energy   oil, right
so he's against oil, guns, and the bible
abraham lincoln can't win with that platform in texas
i can tell you, right
no, we're doing it right
we're doing it right
and you know, our numbers, environmentally, right now are better than they've ever been before, just so you know, because i'm an environmentalist
i am
i want the cleanest water on the planet
i want the cleanest air anywhere   crystal-clean water
i want perfectly clean air
and we have the best numbers right now that we've ever had, meaning in the last 40 years
i assume the numbers a couple of hundred years ago were better because we didn't have anything
so, over the last 40 years   we're in very good shape
the coming months will decide whether our country will be governed by a corrupt, failed, and far-left ruling class or whether we will govern our country
will it be governed of and by the american people
that's what we're talking about
on every front, the extreme leftists   and they are leftists
thank you
thank you
thank you
now, if you want to drive them crazy go, 16 more years
sixteen more years
you know, you heard me say though   there's this whackjob on television, and he's sitting down interviewing a guest, and he's a crazed lunatic
these people   we have driven them crazy
i   you know, at first, i didn't really like the term trump derangement syndrome
i didn't
but it is   it's true
people actually go see psychiatrists
and all we're trying to do is make our country better
i just   is there anything wrong with that
you know, it's crazy
think of it
we want great education
we want low taxes
we want a strong military
we want homes
we want low mortgage rates
what are we doing that bad
what are we doing
and yet they have trump derangement syndrome
it's crazy
it's so crazy, but it's going to all work out
but, you know, this guy is sitting down   he's interviewing a guest and he's saying, you know, he's going to win, don't you
he's going to win
just a couple of months ago
he's going to win
the guest says, no, we're going to fight very hard
we have a good chance
no, no, we're going to fight very… no, no, he's going to win, and in four years he's not leaving
he's never leaving
i'm telling you, he's never… and i thought he was kidding
you know, he's a comedian, i guess
i don't know, he's nothing
but the guy is a zero
but he's going   he's going, no, no he's never leaving
and i started thinking, and the guy really believes that, okay
so from now on, start yelling, 16 more years
you're going to drive them crazy
you'll drive them crazy
on every front, the extreme leftists who control so much of the media, which is   i can't say totally corrupt, but i'll say almost totally corrupt
and you see it now more than you've ever seen it
and you know, i see it better than you because i'm involved
well, thank you to vice president pence
thank you, mike
and hello, pennsylvania, hello
it's great to be back in this state that gave us the liberty bell, pennsylvania steel, hershey chocolate, i like hershey chocolate, the nittany lions
you know the nittany lions, they're doing pretty well too, and the incredible american patriots, just like you, you are patriots
thank you very much
thank you
under republican leadership, america is stronger than ever before and we are respected again
last month you saw it
we smashed expectations with another 260,000 jobs, and unemployment is now more than a 50 year low
we have never seen what's going on with different groups
unemployment is at a position   we've never had anything like this
you're so lucky i became your president, no, i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding
i have to say i'm kidding, because the fake news back there will take that   they'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say, he said they were lucky to have him as president
what a horrible thing to say
because they're fake
anyway, anyway, here in pennsylvania, you had this single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country, not bad
the pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all-time record low
and i hate to tell you this, you know, when i was campaigning three and a half years ago i'd come here, you weren't doing so well, folks, right
you weren't doing so
well, wages were way down
unemployment was way up, it wasn't a pretty picture
just a few months ago, i visited the new shell petrochemical plant in beaver county at $6 billion, with a b, $6 billion
it is the largest investment in pennsylvania history, we're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state
for generations, american manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy, the bedrock
remember last administration you'd need a magic wand and never come back
you'd need a back   we found the magic wand, didn't we
then came nafta, the nafta disaster
i call it one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three pennsylvania manufacturing jobs
your politicians always pledged to fix it, they talk about it for years and years and decades, but they never were able to do it
they came and they went to washington and they did nothing, but unlike those politicians, i keep my promises, and i love pennsylvania
you know, i went to school in pennsylvania, you know that, right
i know it well and i'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the nafta catastrophe once and for all
congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the u
s-mexico-canada agreement or usmca
after years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades they've been looking for this, and then we get it done and we've been waiting for a long time for nancy pelosi to announce usmca and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the united states, and your favorite president, i think
and the reason they announced it on the same day one hour later, they announced impeachment   a few guys standing behind her
they announced impeachment and then an hour later she announced that she's going to do usmca
you know why
it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment, because they're embarrassed by the impeachment and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment
and think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved usmca, so that's ok with me because they approved it and they're very happy to have it
but honestly, it's an incredible deal for our country took too long
it waited in congress for too long a time incredible deal and replacing the worst nafta
we've also just reached a deal with congress to invest a record, $738 billion more into our great military
when i took over, i will tell you, i became president   think of it, almost three years ago
by the way, was that the most exciting night ever
you know, i'm just watching these people
that was one of the greatest things in the history of television from a ratings standpoint from an excitement standpoint
what the hell would they do without me and you
they'd be gone
you know, about a month before i ran, i picked up a new york times, it was like a leaflet that you handed out at a grocery store, and now it's thick ,they've got all their reporters covering trump, trump, trump
i can't imagine they won't endorse, because without me winning, you know what happens, they all go down the tubes, they're gone, all of them
washington post, new york times
there's   very dishonest networks, they are very dishonest, very, very, very dishonest people
no, they are very dishonest people and i have to say this, look, i always have to say this, you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications, but not too many of them, i have to be honest with you
right
the legislator   well, you know that
does anybody think the media is honest
does anybody think they're totally corrupt and dishonest
all right
the legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me, because it's where it's at and a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall, which were building, you know the wall is going up, it gets one of the biggest applause of anything
it's the sixth branch of the united states armed forces, the space force, we're opening up the space force, because you know what, that's where it's at, and everything is built right here in the united states, that's important
and by the way, we build the greatest weapons, the greatest planes, the greatest ships that great   we build it in the united states, there's nobody that comes close
we have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world
rockets and missiles, no place fills it like us
we have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the united states
we've never had a thing like this, we are so high, we are so high
and just a few weeks ago, the united states special forces brought the world's no
1 terrorists to justice
thanks to this strain and courage of our warriors and they are great warriors, the bloodthirsty savage known as al-baghdadi is now dead
and he was quickly replaced by his second in command and his second in command is now dead
and we've got our eye on our sights on third also, we know exactly where and when, but you know he's becoming a very unpopular job, not a lot of takers
yeah
that's what we want
go back to living a good normal life, because america is winning again
america is winning again like never before and, as i always say, and i've already said it twice tonight, this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago, we were laughed at
but while we're delivering historic victories for the american people, the radical left democrats and the failed washington establishment are trying to erase your votes, nullify the election and overthrow our democracy
not going to happen, don't worry about it
i wouldn't lose too much sleep over it
and i have to say this about the republicans, the republicans, and you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your congressman, you have a lot of great ones
these congressmen are great
the republicans have never been so united as they are right now, ever
the house, the senate we've never been this united because it's all a hoax and they understand it
they also understand poll numbers, but i'm sure that had nothing to do with them, but the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative trying to win the 2020 election
that's not going to happen
yesterday, the justice department's inspector general released a report detailing the outrageous scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power   get her out
get her out
get her out, get her out
see these guys want to be so politically correct
you get her out
you see that
i'll tell you, law enforcement's so great
that particular guy wanted to be so politically correct, oh, oh
we don't want to be politically correct
i don't know who he was
he didn't do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous it all started with the russia witch hunt, right
trade
then the inspector general's shocking report proved that the obama fbi obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc
right
the fbi failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the fisa court
they hit it, they deceived it and they lied
the dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent, who quote desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about him
not being the united states president
what's this
these folks, they spied on our campaign, ok, they spied
never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it
we're wise to it
the inspector general found that the fbi-spying application contains 17 errors and omissions commonly known as lies and deceit
when the fbi   and you have great people in the fbi, but not in leadership
you have not good people in leadership, you haven't had
when the fbi uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning
they hit that exonerating, you know that, they hid it
they hid it, so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years
they knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a setup, but they hid it so that nobody could see it
so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically, but now we're stronger politically than we were ever before
and the fbi also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign
look how they've hurt people, they've destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people
their lives have been destroyed by scum, ok, by scum
an fbi lawyer, forged, took a f   email, forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral, ok
what they did is so unbelievable
oh, i look forward   i don't know, i don't know i keep away
i look forward to bill durham's report, that's the one i look forward to
and this report was great, by the ig, especially since he was appointed by president barack hussein obama
considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out very easily, although i suspect we would have
we also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti trump and anti-trump people hatred and bias, texting about and insurance policy
let's have an insurance po   remember, remember
peter strzok and his lover lisa page
remember
lisa, i love you so much lisa, please, lisa, please
lisa, i've never loved anyone like you
we won't allow this to happen to our country
lisa, please tell me you love me, lisa
i love you
peter, i love you
i love you like i've never loved anyone
and if for any reason, if for any reason she loses even though she's as stone-cold corrupt person
if for any reason, she loses, peter, we've got to have an insurance policy, we have to do it, because we're going to go out   and that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years
it was their phony insurance policy
so fbi lawyer, lisa page, so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening
texted the head of counterintelligence, peter strzok
likewise, so in love he couldn't see straight
this poor guy   did i hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from lisa
that's what i heard
i don't know if it's true, the fake news will never report it, but it could be true
no, that's what i heard
i don't know, i mean, who could believe a thing like that
no, i heard that peter strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover
oh, lisa, i hope you miss him
lisa, he'll never be the same
but he said he's not ever going to become president and strzok looked back
no, no
he won't we'll stop it we'll stop it
can you believe we found these texts
can you believe this is fbi agents at a high level
no, no
well, stop it they're going to stop us from winning an election, and then we have to listen
there was no bias, oh, there was no bias
think of these people
they write, there was no bias and yet he's saying, no, no
darling, we'll stop it
and then they announce there was no bias
no, you know what we're doing
and it's not easy, and somebody said, a regular president    i don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer, a regular president would have been under a table, numb in the mouth saying
take me home, mommy, this is too tough for me
so true
true, they know
and while it was tough on my family, i have to say, very unfair to my family, very tough on my family, i've a great family, tough, for me, it's my life
i do it, i do it
it's one thing, but very tough, on a family thing like this happens, it's a disgrace
but day after day we're exposing something called that filthy disgusting, horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up
and now, after two and a half years now that the rush of witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud that congressional democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with ukraine, but that's already failing
you saw their so-called articles of impeachment today
people are saying they're not even a crime
what happened
all of these horrible things, remember, bribery and this and that, where are they
they said these two things are not even a crime
this is the lightest, weakest impeachment here, you know, our country's had, actually many impeachment
you called judges and lots of it, many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said this is impeachment lite
this is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far
it's not even like an impeachment
these people are stone-cold crooked
when a guy like shifty schiff, here's a corrupt politician, right
he made up my statement because   see, i did one thing very good
as soon as i heard about this deal, i released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements and, by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country, because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game
remember the second whistleblower was coming, right
and then the informer, who is the informer
i know the informer is
the informer   so the informer obviously gave him false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, right
they wrote something totally different from what i said
what i said was perfect, but it screwed up the whole works, because most guys would never do that
they didn't even know, probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word-for-word transcribed, so beautiful
am i lucky i had it transcribed
think of that
think of that
so when i said release it   and i don't like doing that because you're releasing it, it's a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentleman, president of ukraine, the new president of ukraine   and we call them up and we said, would it be okay
our secretary of state made the call, would it be ok
and they didn't know what we were talking about, but they said, yeah, it's ok
and by the way, he his foreign minister, everybody did
you know they said there was no pressure
he didn't
do anything wrong
there was no pressure put on us that didn't stop anybody, but we released the conversation and that gummed it up
now, all of a sudden, we never heard from the second whistleblower we never heard about who the informer was the whistleblower who is going to come out
strong he's, disappeared
where's the whistleblower he's disappeared, he's gone
maybe our great congressman can find him
ok but the whistleblower is gone
he flew the coop because he reported incorrectly and the ig who didn't want to look at the conversation
he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to congress so that congress could have fun with it ought to be ashamed of himself
but today the house democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment
that house democrats are walking back from everything they claimed with today's announcement they're now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice and there were no crimes whatsoever
there are no crimes, it says it
there are no crimes, they're impeaching me and there are no crimes
this has to be a first in history, they're impeaching me, you know why, because they want to win an election and that's the only way they can do so
the democrats have nothing and they've turned the somber process of impeachment, and it was you know to me
impeachment is a very ugly word
it's a word i associate with some very bad times in our country
the good news is we're having the best times in history in our country, ok
but the word impeachment to me is a very, very ugly word
it's a dark ugly word, but   but i have to tell you as bad it is, it meant something
when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you have serious crimes, it's impeachment
hat would happen every 50 years, every 40 years every hundred years
this was a big deal
they make it so like, let's do it every every six months, they've cheapened the process, they've cheapened the process
these people are so bad
the radical left democrats
and i actually think that pelosi, who, by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control
she has totally   it's being run now by this crazy aoc, plus three aoc plus three
now it's being run by other people, the far left has just grab that party, it is so sad to see
and she knew what would happen
i didn't, because i didn't figure the polls would go through the roof
they went out today in michigan, in wisconsin in a place called pennsylvania
no, no
the polls are through the roof
they're called swing states very important states
we won pennsylvania the last time we're going to win it again, but even bigger
our polls have gone over the last month, they've gone through the roof
you look at it, take a look at it, it came out today, the firehouse polled, firehouse poll
it's an important poll
it was always good and never looked at it today
i like it a lot we're up through   nobody could even believe it
so what pelosi did it as i said, they do the impeachment then right away, let's do usmca right on top of it, you'd think she'd wait like a day
she wanted to smother the impeachment crap and that's probably what she did at least to an extent
but any democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity and their career, ok
and some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this, how about low-iq maxine waters
how about green
how about green
with green   how about green, where he said, we have to impeach him, because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election
this is what this is
what we're dealing with
you know we're dealing with some very bad people, we're dealing with people that don't respect you, and by the way, you know they talk about the elite, you're the elite, they're not the elite, you're the elite
you got better education, you got better   you got better everything, you're the elite
it always bothers me, they said, the elite
this is the elite
look at these people, how beautiful
this is the elite
you know the elite
you look at those jobs reports, where the best in history, unemployment for african-americans, best in history, unemployment, hispanic-americans, best in history, unemployment, asian-americans, you're the elite, you're the elite
but they said they'll do it again, because this has been a total bust
they'll do it again, and by the way, the senate's been so professional, so good, so strong, so solid
just like these gentlemen in the house so solid
so we have to vote these crazy people, the hell out of office, and in 2020 i'm going to work like hell that we take over the house
we have to take over the house
we have to
right
got to take over the house, mike
so here are the facts that shifty schiff   is that guy the worst
he comes up to a microphone
now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago
oh, i have absolute proof that the president of the united states conspired with russia
russia
what the hell do i have to do with russia
by the way, russia wishes that hillary clinton won
they wish
we are now no
1 in the world in energy, russia's no
were beating out russia and saudi arabia
you'd have windmills all over the place
if you had crooked hillary, they'd be knocking out those birds left and right
those windmills, wah wah, wah
darling, i want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind
what do i do
i want to watch the election results, darling, there's no wind, the damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming, i think
i think it's global warming
global warming, no more wind, no more life
the oceans are going to rise
one eighth of an inch within the next 250 years we're going to be wiped out
look, i want clean air
i want clean water, crystal clean
i want   and that's what we have at a record level
our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been, ok, with all that we're doing
and we haven't closed up all of our industry, we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs and right now we're by far the largest economy in the world
and if you remember, you could look, if you go back five, six, seven years in 2019, they say china was going to catch us as the world's largest economy
guess what
they're way behind, they're way behind, because over the last three years   you see the stock market set 131 records from the day
think of that, and that means jobs
that means 401(k)s i have so many people that come up to me, thank you, sir
my wife was so in love with me, because i went up 79% in the 401(k)
she thinks i'm a genius
she always thought i was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope
now she thinks i'm a financial genius, sir
and all i did was buy some stock
i have stock in a 401(k), and you made me into a genius or she loves me so much more than she ever did
shows you the power of money, right
ain't that terrible
but i have so many people, 401(k)s are through the roof
your jobs are through the roof
we have the lowest unemployment rate and now, more importantly, than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades
you remember, four years ago i was here, and i told people, i said, you know 20 years ago, people made more money than they made four years ago, not now, not anymore, because people now cannot only make a lot more money
if they don't like their job, they go out and they get a different job and they get more money and ultimately they did find one that they love
you have so many opportunities right now, wages are up, jobs are up, and today we set a new record
almost 160 million people are working, we've never come close to that number
that's a hell of a number
but just quickly here are the facts on shifty schiff, dishonest guy makes up my statements
he said, the president of ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure, but he didn't want to say that we said, say it, say it
you crooked bastard, say it
but he doesn't want to say it
we said, say it
nah, i'd like to force him to say it
he'll walk up to the mic, ladies and gentlemen    guy's a total corrupt guy
listen, just to finish off, a man who i really   i don't know him, but i respect him because the ukrainian foreign minister   and he said it so strongly, i have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance
he just said that
the democrats, who are corrupt, refuse to say that
and that's ultimately, the only one that matters the leaders of ukraine because they're the ones that know of this pressure, not some crooked ambassador, that's a deep state or that's a bushie or that's a clintonite or that's a barack obama ambassador, ok
the ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about
they refuse to say it because they're dishonest people there's only one way to stop the rabid, partisan democrats, pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020
so we can take back the house, hold the senate and keep the white house
it's the only way, only way
ok, so i'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight
we love warriors like the guys that killed al-baghdadi
you know, how much press   you know how much press i got
i don't care about press, but conan the dog got more than i did, and that's ok
conan was almost electrocuted, he deserves it
they gave me about a day and that's ok, because the people understand, we made a great decision
i remember this, al-baghdadi was the founder of isis
al-baghdadi was a vicious ruthless person
al-baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of ohio, think of that, that's a big caliphate and we now have taken 100% of the caliphate and we have thousands and thousands of isis prisoners and with obama you did nothing, you did nothing but get your ass kicked
true
all right
we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways, they fight for us
they really are incredible and they come right from the state of pennsylvania
had you ever notice where biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state like, if he's in ohio, it's great to be in iowa tonight
if he's in pennsylvania, it's wonderful to be in the state of delaware
what is wrong with this guy
what's wrong with him
there's something wrong, ok, there's something wrong
he he keeps   how many times can you do that so far
it could happen because you know i was doing six and seven a day that last month, that last beautiful month that i loved, i was doing six
i left these guys alone
i didn't want to do interviews, they are a waste of time
we just had these big, beautiful rallies
i was doing   and you know
if you start getting a little, you know, i went to michigan then i went to wisconsin
then i went   i'm saying, you know, like what the hell is going on, these crowds are incredible and we had the biggest crowds
by the way, to this day, there has never been   and they'll always correct me, in the history of politics in the history of our country
there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw and i don't have a guitar
i have no guitar, but this has never happened
i mean, if you took ronald reagan and we all like ronald reagan
i liked him
i thought he was a great guy, but if he came to pennsylvania for a rally, you know, if he had a thousand people in a ballroom or something
you know i mean we're getting crowds, 25, 30,000 people and then there'll be 20,000 thousand people outside
you know we set up screens outside and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching and do you people out there, i'm sorry
it's pretty rough, but no there's never been anything like it
one instruction
get me the biggest arena you can get
we   we don't have empty seats
i mean, look at this
how many   how many seats is this, 11,000
how much
10,500 it's packed
it's beyond that
and don't forget, look at the floor and then you go out  no and then you go out and you look outside and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing we're fixing our country, we're healing our country, we're making america great again
so i want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward
representative glenn thompson
come up here, buddy
come up here
a man has been a friend of mine for a long time, mike kelly, don't get into a fight with mike
come up now
a wonderful man who represents this area, scott perry
representative lloyd smucker
lloyd
a guy who is always there for us, john joyce and two people that you all know very well in this state
they bring home the bacon, dan meuser and fred keller
thank you, fellas
thank you
i want to also bring back our pennsylvania party chairman and i know his grandfather, i shouldn't say that to you, he was a tremendous man, dan tabas, but i'm going to introduce somebody that dan always said had tremendous talent
little did i know that he'd be working with us and he's really working well he's smart, he's tough, lawrence tabas
come on up, lawrence
also with us tonight
pennsylvania trump victory chairwoman, bernie

you know, you know who that is
you know that is, everybody knows who that is
national committeeman bob asher, rnc co-chairman tommy hicks, who's been incredible, and my friend david urban, david
so i just want to thank this an amazing group of people and with their help and the help of everyone here, we are going to set records like we've never set before
you know, i used to say, and i sort of still have to say 2016, i don't know of anything like that can ever happen, but i think we're much better
you know all of the things i said, whether to cut taxes, we're going to cut regulations, we're going to take care of our vets
look what we did for our vets with choice, right
look what we did, look what we did
we now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the v
, right
fired over a thousand people that were disrespecting our vets
they wouldn't have done it in primetime, i can tell you that
but what we've done for our vets
what we've done in rebuilding our military
what we've done in so many ways and we, unlike the democrats, will protect your second amendment
so we've done a job and we're proud of it, and we have tremendous people and let's give them a hand, and thank you very much
thank you
thank you, everybody, thank you
thank you folks
vote for these people, even if you don't like 'em vote for 'em
oh, that's a beautiful new hat
look at the hat that guy's got up
how's that working out
is that hat good
i love that hat
look at this guy
that says, keep america great
should we do the poll
should we do a poll
they're ready
so we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics
make america great again
and we wait and we have our new phrase because we've made america great, i told you, the stock market, we've rebuilt our military we've cut your taxes like at a level that nobody could even think possible
you look at your median   take a look at your median income
take a look at what's happened, the numbers, median household income
take a look at your numbers
with president bush it went up $400 in eight years
with president obama, it went up $975 dollars in eight years
with president trump, it went up 5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years
that's a big thing
wait
and then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in and that's one of the very big reasons why our   i think that in regulations, but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so because they talk about our consumer
it's loaded with money
thank you very much, mr president, i appreciate it
but with the help of everyone here we have now the hottest economy
you know what i mean
dictators and presidents and kings and queens and prime ministers
they all come into that beautiful oval office, so beautiful, right
so respected and the first thing they almost always say, sir, congratulations on your economy
we're trying to do the same thing
i said, you won't be able to do it
they won't be able to
let him give it a shot, but they all say, congratulations on the great job you've done with the economy
but we've all done the great job
not me, we've all done
i've been your spokesman and i've done a good job as spokesman, but they all say that, but we've done a good job in many ways
you know all of the promises that i made
i'm the only politician in history that i've actually kept more promises than i made
think of that
in other words, i made it here like a thing like right to try
nobody talked about right to try
we got right to try, that somebody terminally ill
we have the greatest medicines in the world, the greatest doctors, the greatest labs in the world, nobody close, but it takes years to get it approved and i got it approved
so you can sign a document, get it and if you want to see the lives that we're saving, it's a beautiful thing, a beautiful thing is happening
right to try, right to try
but we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election
if i would have said that the fake news would have gone crazy, they would have said that's impossible
these people would have gone crazy
they go crazy anyway, and i don't even say it and right here in pennsylvania, we've created 160,000 brand new, beautiful jobs, and you have companies moving in and moving back and as i said, african-american, hispanic-american, asian-american unemployment, the lowest ever in the history of our country, the lowest unemployment rates, wages for low-income workers, have gone up more than 10%
nobody thought that was possible
they are one of the biggest in terms of a group, one of the biggest beneficiaries
this year, 40 million american families will benefit from the republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of $2,200
we ended the last administration's war on american energy
the united states is now   and i said it and i'll say it all night long, no
1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world and there's nobody even close
and in the state of pennsylvania, natural gas production is up 34% since our election, 34
virtually, every leading democrat, has pledged to entirely eliminate american production of oil, clean coal, natural gas
i don't think somebody's coming into pennsylvania
you know those new petrochemical plants, they don't like them at all
thousands and thousands of jobs, incredible millions of dollars in taxes
how about going to the state of texas
we had one candidate, who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right
beto
remember
so he wanted to get rid of religion, the bible
he wanted to get rid of guns and he wanted to get rid of oil
how about going to texas and say no bible, no oil
think of this one, no bible, no oil, no guns
i think you could be abraham lincoln and not win that particular race and it wouldn't be much different in the state of pennsylvania that i can tell you, but you know somebody that believes in that is sleepy joe biden
he was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in pennsylvania
you saw that, but the voters of this commonwealth will never ever let that happen
can you imagine a guy coming in whether it's him or anybody else
they all want to do it
he just raises his hand
he has no clue what he's doing
there is that   remember he look   you want to give illegal aliens health care, even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up   and he looks and they're all raising their hand
did you see that
well he, oh, oh, oh, ok, i'll do it too
in addition to replacing nafta, i've taken the toughest ever action against china's trade abuses
they want to make a deal so badly
we're doing well with the deal, but they want to make a deal
please make a deal
we don't want to pay tariffs anymore, please, please
thanks to our steel tariffs, steel mills in pennsylvania are roaring back to life and u
steel has just announced a $1 billion investment in mond valley works in pittsburgh
you know that, right
$1 billion
they weren't investing, they were divesting
the steel companies, one of a   it's an amazing achievement
we tax all of the dumped steel, comes in from china and other places, 25%, all of it
all of a sudden, our steel mills are doing again
and we need steel
you know, it's not like you could say, gee, we'll get it from another country
we need that for defense
we need it for our ships, we need it for our planes, we need it
we can't play games with steel
after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation
and, very importantly, in everything we do, we are putting america first
sorry
we gave up at the globalists, folks
you know, let's build the world, let's forget about our country
let's just rebuild the world
oh no, issue have the democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on the issue of immigration
far left politician, i mean they're fighting me on the wall
you have no idea but we're building it, and it's fine that we have the money coming in from the military
well, thank you to vice president pence
thank you, mike
and hello, pennsylvania, hello
it's great to be back in this state that gave us the liberty bell, pennsylvania steel, hershey chocolate, i like hershey chocolate, the nittany lions
you know the nittany lions, they're doing pretty well too, and the incredible american patriots, just like you, you are patriots
thank you very much
thank you
under republican leadership, america is stronger than ever before and we are respected again
last month you saw it
we smashed expectations with another 260,000 jobs, and unemployment is now more than a 50 year low
we have never seen what's going on with different groups
unemployment is at a position   we've never had anything like this
you're so lucky i became your president, no, i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding
i have to say i'm kidding, because the fake news back there will take that   they'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say, he said they were lucky to have him as president
what a horrible thing to say
because they're fake
anyway, anyway, here in pennsylvania, you had this single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country, not bad
the pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all-time record low
and i hate to tell you this, you know, when i was campaigning three and a half years ago i'd come here, you weren't doing so well, folks, right
you weren't doing so
well, wages were way down
unemployment was way up, it wasn't a pretty picture
just a few months ago, i visited the new shell petrochemical plant in beaver county at $6 billion, with a b, $6 billion
it is the largest investment in pennsylvania history, we're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state
for generations, american manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy, the bedrock
remember last administration you'd need a magic wand and never come back
you'd need a back   we found the magic wand, didn't we
then came nafta, the nafta disaster
i call it one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three pennsylvania manufacturing jobs
your politicians always pledged to fix it, they talk about it for years and years and decades, but they never were able to do it
they came and they went to washington and they did nothing, but unlike those politicians, i keep my promises, and i love pennsylvania
you know, i went to school in pennsylvania, you know that, right
i know it well and i'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the nafta catastrophe once and for all
congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the u
s-mexico-canada agreement or usmca
after years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades they've been looking for this, and then we get it done and we've been waiting for a long time for nancy pelosi to announce usmca and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the united states, and your favorite president, i think
and the reason they announced it on the same day one hour later, they announced impeachment   a few guys standing behind her
they announced impeachment and then an hour later she announced that she's going to do usmca
you know why
it's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment, because they're embarrassed by the impeachment and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment
and think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved usmca, so that's ok with me because they approved it and they're very happy to have it
but honestly, it's an incredible deal for our country took too long
it waited in congress for too long a time incredible deal and replacing the worst nafta
we've also just reached a deal with congress to invest a record, $738 billion more into our great military
when i took over, i will tell you, i became president   think of it, almost three years ago
by the way, was that the most exciting night ever
you know, i'm just watching these people
that was one of the greatest things in the history of television from a ratings standpoint from an excitement standpoint
what the hell would they do without me and you
they'd be gone
you know, about a month before i ran, i picked up a new york times, it was like a leaflet that you handed out at a grocery store, and now it's thick ,they've got all their reporters covering trump, trump, trump
i can't imagine they won't endorse, because without me winning, you know what happens, they all go down the tubes, they're gone, all of them
washington post, new york times
there's   very dishonest networks, they are very dishonest, very, very, very dishonest people
no, they are very dishonest people and i have to say this, look, i always have to say this, you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications, but not too many of them, i have to be honest with you
right
the legislator   well, you know that
does anybody think the media is honest
does anybody think they're totally corrupt and dishonest
all right
the legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me, because it's where it's at and a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall, which were building, you know the wall is going up, it gets one of the biggest applause of anything
it's the sixth branch of the united states armed forces, the space force, we're opening up the space force, because you know what, that's where it's at, and everything is built right here in the united states, that's important
and by the way, we build the greatest weapons, the greatest planes, the greatest ships that great   we build it in the united states, there's nobody that comes close
we have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world
rockets and missiles, no place fills it like us
we have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the united states
we've never had a thing like this, we are so high, we are so high
and just a few weeks ago, the united states special forces brought the world's no
1 terrorists to justice
thanks to this strain and courage of our warriors and they are great warriors, the bloodthirsty savage known as al-baghdadi is now dead
and he was quickly replaced by his second in command and his second in command is now dead
and we've got our eye on our sights on third also, we know exactly where and when, but you know he's becoming a very unpopular job, not a lot of takers
yeah
that's what we want
go back to living a good normal life, because america is winning again
america is winning again like never before and, as i always say, and i've already said it twice tonight, this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago, we were laughed at
but while we're delivering historic victories for the american people, the radical left democrats and the failed washington establishment are trying to erase your votes, nullify the election and overthrow our democracy
not going to happen, don't worry about it
i wouldn't lose too much sleep over it
and i have to say this about the republicans, the republicans, and you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your congressman, you have a lot of great ones
these congressmen are great
the republicans have never been so united as they are right now, ever
the house, the senate we've never been this united because it's all a hoax and they understand it
they also understand poll numbers, but i'm sure that had nothing to do with them, but the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative trying to win the 2020 election
that's not going to happen
yesterday, the justice department's inspector general released a report detailing the outrageous scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power   get her out
get her out
get her out, get her out
see these guys want to be so politically correct
you get her out
you see that
i'll tell you, law enforcement's so great
that particular guy wanted to be so politically correct, oh, oh
we don't want to be politically correct
i don't know who he was
he didn't do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous it all started with the russia witch hunt, right
trade
then the inspector general's shocking report proved that the obama fbi obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc
right
the fbi failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the fisa court
they hit it, they deceived it and they lied
the dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent, who quote desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about him
not being the united states president
what's this
these folks, they spied on our campaign, ok, they spied
never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it
we're wise to it
the inspector general found that the fbi-spying application contains 17 errors and omissions commonly known as lies and deceit
when the fbi   and you have great people in the fbi, but not in leadership
you have not good people in leadership, you haven't had
when the fbi uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning
they hit that exonerating, you know that, they hid it
they hid it, so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years
they knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a setup, but they hid it so that nobody could see it
so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically, but now we're stronger politically than we were ever before
and the fbi also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign
look how they've hurt people, they've destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people
their lives have been destroyed by scum, ok, by scum
an fbi lawyer, forged, took a f   email, forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral, ok
what they did is so unbelievable
oh, i look forward   i don't know, i don't know i keep away
i look forward to bill durham's report, that's the one i look forward to
and this report was great, by the ig, especially since he was appointed by president barack hussein obama
considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out very easily, although i suspect we would have
we also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti trump and anti-trump people hatred and bias, texting about and insurance policy
let's have an insurance po   remember, remember
peter strzok and his lover lisa page
remember
lisa, i love you so much lisa, please, lisa, please
lisa, i've never loved anyone like you
we won't allow this to happen to our country
lisa, please tell me you love me, lisa
i love you
peter, i love you
i love you like i've never loved anyone
and if for any reason, if for any reason she loses even though she's as stone-cold corrupt person
if for any reason, she loses, peter, we've got to have an insurance policy, we have to do it, because we're going to go out   and that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years
it was their phony insurance policy
so fbi lawyer, lisa page, so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening
texted the head of counterintelligence, peter strzok
likewise, so in love he couldn't see straight
this poor guy   did i hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from lisa
that's what i heard
i don't know if it's true, the fake news will never report it, but it could be true
no, that's what i heard
i don't know, i mean, who could believe a thing like that
no, i heard that peter strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover
oh, lisa, i hope you miss him
lisa, he'll never be the same
but he said he's not ever going to become president and strzok looked back
no, no
he won't we'll stop it we'll stop it
can you believe we found these texts
can you believe this is fbi agents at a high level
no, no
well, stop it they're going to stop us from winning an election, and then we have to listen
there was no bias, oh, there was no bias
think of these people
they write, there was no bias and yet he's saying, no, no
darling, we'll stop it
and then they announce there was no bias
no, you know what we're doing
and it's not easy, and somebody said, a regular president    i don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer, a regular president would have been under a table, numb in the mouth saying
take me home, mommy, this is too tough for me
so true
true, they know
and while it was tough on my family, i have to say, very unfair to my family, very tough on my family, i've a great family, tough, for me, it's my life
i do it, i do it
it's one thing, but very tough, on a family thing like this happens, it's a disgrace
but day after day we're exposing something called that filthy disgusting, horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up
and now, after two and a half years now that the rush of witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud that congressional democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with ukraine, but that's already failing
you saw their so-called articles of impeachment today
people are saying they're not even a crime
what happened
all of these horrible things, remember, bribery and this and that, where are they
they said these two things are not even a crime
this is the lightest, weakest impeachment here, you know, our country's had, actually many impeachment
you called judges and lots of it, many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said this is impeachment lite
this is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far
it's not even like an impeachment
these people are stone-cold crooked
when a guy like shifty schiff, here's a corrupt politician, right
he made up my statement because   see, i did one thing very good
as soon as i heard about this deal, i released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements and, by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country, because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game
remember the second whistleblower was coming, right
and then the informer, who is the informer
i know the informer is
the informer   so the informer obviously gave him false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, right
they wrote something totally different from what i said
what i said was perfect, but it screwed up the whole works, because most guys would never do that
they didn't even know, probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word-for-word transcribed, so beautiful
am i lucky i had it transcribed
think of that
think of that
so when i said release it   and i don't like doing that because you're releasing it, it's a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentleman, president of ukraine, the new president of ukraine   and we call them up and we said, would it be okay
our secretary of state made the call, would it be ok
and they didn't know what we were talking about, but they said, yeah, it's ok
and by the way, he his foreign minister, everybody did
you know they said there was no pressure
he didn't
do anything wrong
there was no pressure put on us that didn't stop anybody, but we released the conversation and that gummed it up
now, all of a sudden, we never heard from the second whistleblower we never heard about who the informer was the whistleblower who is going to come out
strong he's, disappeared
where's the whistleblower he's disappeared, he's gone
maybe our great congressman can find him
ok but the whistleblower is gone
he flew the coop because he reported incorrectly and the ig who didn't want to look at the conversation
he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to congress so that congress could have fun with it ought to be ashamed of himself
but today the house democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment
that house democrats are walking back from everything they claimed with today's announcement they're now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice and there were no crimes whatsoever
there are no crimes, it says it
there are no crimes, they're impeaching me and there are no crimes
this has to be a first in history, they're impeaching me, you know why, because they want to win an election and that's the only way they can do so
the democrats have nothing and they've turned the somber process of impeachment, and it was you know to me
impeachment is a very ugly word
it's a word i associate with some very bad times in our country
the good news is we're having the best times in history in our country, ok
but the word impeachment to me is a very, very ugly word
it's a dark ugly word, but   but i have to tell you as bad it is, it meant something
when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you have serious crimes, it's impeachment
hat would happen every 50 years, every 40 years every hundred years
this was a big deal
they make it so like, let's do it every every six months, they've cheapened the process, they've cheapened the process
these people are so bad
the radical left democrats
and i actually think that pelosi, who, by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control
she has totally   it's being run now by this crazy aoc, plus three aoc plus three
now it's being run by other people, the far left has just grab that party, it is so sad to see
and she knew what would happen
i didn't, because i didn't figure the polls would go through the roof
they went out today in michigan, in wisconsin in a place called pennsylvania
no, no
the polls are through the roof
they're called swing states very important states
we won pennsylvania the last time we're going to win it again, but even bigger
our polls have gone over the last month, they've gone through the roof
you look at it, take a look at it, it came out today, the firehouse polled, firehouse poll
it's an important poll
it was always good and never looked at it today
i like it a lot we're up through   nobody could even believe it
so what pelosi did it as i said, they do the impeachment then right away, let's do usmca right on top of it, you'd think she'd wait like a day
she wanted to smother the impeachment crap and that's probably what she did at least to an extent
but any democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity and their career, ok
and some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this, how about low-iq maxine waters
how about green
how about green
with green   how about green, where he said, we have to impeach him, because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election
this is what this is
what we're dealing with
you know we're dealing with some very bad people, we're dealing with people that don't respect you, and by the way, you know they talk about the elite, you're the elite, they're not the elite, you're the elite
you got better education, you got better   you got better everything, you're the elite
it always bothers me, they said, the elite
this is the elite
look at these people, how beautiful
this is the elite
you know the elite
you look at those jobs reports, where the best in history, unemployment for african-americans, best in history, unemployment, hispanic-americans, best in history, unemployment, asian-americans, you're the elite, you're the elite
but they said they'll do it again, because this has been a total bust
they'll do it again, and by the way, the senate's been so professional, so good, so strong, so solid
just like these gentlemen in the house so solid
so we have to vote these crazy people, the hell out of office, and in 2020 i'm going to work like hell that we take over the house
we have to take over the house
we have to
right
got to take over the house, mike
so here are the facts that shifty schiff   is that guy the worst
he comes up to a microphone
now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago
oh, i have absolute proof that the president of the united states conspired with russia
russia
what the hell do i have to do with russia
by the way, russia wishes that hillary clinton won
they wish
we are now no
1 in the world in energy, russia's no
were beating out russia and saudi arabia
you'd have windmills all over the place
if you had crooked hillary, they'd be knocking out those birds left and right
those windmills, wah wah, wah
darling, i want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind
what do i do
i want to watch the election results, darling, there's no wind, the damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming, i think
i think it's global warming
global warming, no more wind, no more life
the oceans are going to rise
one eighth of an inch within the next 250 years we're going to be wiped out
look, i want clean air
i want clean water, crystal clean
i want   and that's what we have at a record level
our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been, ok, with all that we're doing
and we haven't closed up all of our industry, we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs and right now we're by far the largest economy in the world
and if you remember, you could look, if you go back five, six, seven years in 2019, they say china was going to catch us as the world's largest economy
guess what
they're way behind, they're way behind, because over the last three years   you see the stock market set 131 records from the day
think of that, and that means jobs
that means 401(k)s i have so many people that come up to me, thank you, sir
my wife was so in love with me, because i went up 79% in the 401(k)
she thinks i'm a genius
she always thought i was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope
now she thinks i'm a financial genius, sir
and all i did was buy some stock
i have stock in a 401(k), and you made me into a genius or she loves me so much more than she ever did
shows you the power of money, right
ain't that terrible
but i have so many people, 401(k)s are through the roof
your jobs are through the roof
we have the lowest unemployment rate and now, more importantly, than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades
you remember, four years ago i was here, and i told people, i said, you know 20 years ago, people made more money than they made four years ago, not now, not anymore, because people now cannot only make a lot more money
if they don't like their job, they go out and they get a different job and they get more money and ultimately they did find one that they love
you have so many opportunities right now, wages are up, jobs are up, and today we set a new record
almost 160 million people are working, we've never come close to that number
that's a hell of a number
but just quickly here are the facts on shifty schiff, dishonest guy makes up my statements
he said, the president of ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure, but he didn't want to say that we said, say it, say it
you crooked bastard, say it
but he doesn't want to say it
we said, say it
nah, i'd like to force him to say it
he'll walk up to the mic, ladies and gentlemen    guy's a total corrupt guy
listen, just to finish off, a man who i really   i don't know him, but i respect him because the ukrainian foreign minister   and he said it so strongly, i have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance
he just said that
the democrats, who are corrupt, refuse to say that
and that's ultimately, the only one that matters the leaders of ukraine because they're the ones that know of this pressure, not some crooked ambassador, that's a deep state or that's a bushie or that's a clintonite or that's a barack obama ambassador, ok
the ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about
they refuse to say it because they're dishonest people there's only one way to stop the rabid, partisan democrats, pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020
so we can take back the house, hold the senate and keep the white house
it's the only way, only way
ok, so i'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight
we love warriors like the guys that killed al-baghdadi
you know, how much press   you know how much press i got
i don't care about press, but conan the dog got more than i did, and that's ok
conan was almost electrocuted, he deserves it
they gave me about a day and that's ok, because the people understand, we made a great decision
i remember this, al-baghdadi was the founder of isis
al-baghdadi was a vicious ruthless person
al-baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the state of ohio, think of that, that's a big caliphate and we now have taken 100% of the caliphate and we have thousands and thousands of isis prisoners and with obama you did nothing, you did nothing but get your ass kicked
true
all right
we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways, they fight for us
they really are incredible and they come right from the state of pennsylvania
had you ever notice where biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state like, if he's in ohio, it's great to be in iowa tonight
if he's in pennsylvania, it's wonderful to be in the state of delaware
what is wrong with this guy
what's wrong with him
there's something wrong, ok, there's something wrong
he he keeps   how many times can you do that so far
it could happen because you know i was doing six and seven a day that last month, that last beautiful month that i loved, i was doing six
i left these guys alone
i didn't want to do interviews, they are a waste of time
we just had these big, beautiful rallies
i was doing   and you know
if you start getting a little, you know, i went to michigan then i went to wisconsin
then i went   i'm saying, you know, like what the hell is going on, these crowds are incredible and we had the biggest crowds
by the way, to this day, there has never been   and they'll always correct me, in the history of politics in the history of our country
there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw and i don't have a guitar
i have no guitar, but this has never happened
i mean, if you took ronald reagan and we all like ronald reagan
i liked him
i thought he was a great guy, but if he came to pennsylvania for a rally, you know, if he had a thousand people in a ballroom or something
you know i mean we're getting crowds, 25, 30,000 people and then there'll be 20,000 thousand people outside
you know we set up screens outside and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching and do you people out there, i'm sorry
it's pretty rough, but no there's never been anything like it
one instruction
get me the biggest arena you can get
we   we don't have empty seats
i mean, look at this
how many   how many seats is this, 11,000
how much
10,500 it's packed
it's beyond that
and don't forget, look at the floor and then you go out  no and then you go out and you look outside and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing we're fixing our country, we're healing our country, we're making america great again
so i want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward
representative glenn thompson
come up here, buddy
come up here
a man has been a friend of mine for a long time, mike kelly, don't get into a fight with mike
come up now
a wonderful man who represents this area, scott perry
representative lloyd smucker
lloyd
a guy who is always there for us, john joyce and two people that you all know very well in this state
they bring home the bacon, dan meuser and fred keller
thank you, fellas
thank you
i want to also bring back our pennsylvania party chairman and i know his grandfather, i shouldn't say that to you, he was a tremendous man, dan tabas, but i'm going to introduce somebody that dan always said had tremendous talent
little did i know that he'd be working with us and he's really working well he's smart, he's tough, lawrence tabas
come on up, lawrence
also with us tonight
pennsylvania trump victory chairwoman, bernie
you know this, right
you know this person   comfort
you know, you know who that is
you know that is, everybody knows who that is
national committeeman bob asher, rnc co-chairman tommy hicks, who's been incredible, and my friend david urban, david
so i just want to thank this an amazing group of people and with their help and the help of everyone here, we are going to set records like we've never set before
you know, i used to say, and i sort of still have to say 2016, i don't know of anything like that can ever happen, but i think we're much better
you know all of the things i said, whether to cut taxes, we're going to cut regulations, we're going to take care of our vets
look what we did for our vets with choice, right
look what we did, look what we did
we now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the v
, right
fired over a thousand people that were disrespecting our vets
they wouldn't have done it in primetime, i can tell you that
but what we've done for our vets
what we've done in rebuilding our military
what we've done in so many ways and we, unlike the democrats, will protect your second amendment
so we've done a job and we're proud of it, and we have tremendous people and let's give them a hand, and thank you very much
thank you
thank you, everybody, thank you
thank you folks
vote for these people, even if you don't like 'em vote for 'em
oh, that's a beautiful new hat
look at the hat that guy's got up
how's that working out
is that hat good
i love that hat
look at this guy
that says, keep america great
should we do the poll
should we do a poll
they're ready
so we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics
make america great again
and we wait and we have our new phrase because we've made america great, i told you, the stock market, we've rebuilt our military we've cut your taxes like at a level that nobody could even think possible
you look at your median   take a look at your median income
take a look at what's happened, the numbers, median household income
take a look at your numbers
with president bush it went up $400 in eight years
with president obama, it went up $975 dollars in eight years
with president trump, it went up 5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years
that's a big thing
wait
and then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in and that's one of the very big reasons why our   i think that in regulations, but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so because they talk about our consumer
it's loaded with money
thank you very much, mr president, i appreciate it
but with the help of everyone here we have now the hottest economy
you know what i mean
dictators and presidents and kings and queens and prime ministers
they all come into that beautiful oval office, so beautiful, right
so respected and the first thing they almost always say, sir, congratulations on your economy
we're trying to do the same thing
i said, you won't be able to do it
they won't be able to
let him give it a shot, but they all say, congratulations on the great job you've done with the economy
but we've all done the great job
not me, we've all done
i've been your spokesman and i've done a good job as spokesman, but they all say that, but we've done a good job in many ways
you know all of the promises that i made
i'm the only politician in history that i've actually kept more promises than i made
think of that
in other words, i made it here like a thing like right to try
nobody talked about right to try
we got right to try, that somebody terminally ill
we have the greatest medicines in the world, the greatest doctors, the greatest labs in the world, nobody close, but it takes years to get it approved and i got it approved
so you can sign a document, get it and if you want to see the lives that we're saving, it's a beautiful thing, a beautiful thing is happening
right to try, right to try
but we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election
if i would have said that the fake news would have gone crazy, they would have said that's impossible
these people would have gone crazy
they go crazy anyway, and i don't even say it and right here in pennsylvania, we've created 160,000 brand new, beautiful jobs, and you have companies moving in and moving back and as i said, african-american, hispanic-american, asian-american unemployment, the lowest ever in the history of our country, the lowest unemployment rates, wages for low-income workers, have gone up more than 10%
nobody thought that was possible
they are one of the biggest in terms of a group, one of the biggest beneficiaries
this year, 40 million american families will benefit from the republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of $2,200
we ended the last administration's war on american energy
the united states is now   and i said it and i'll say it all night long, no
1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world and there's nobody even close
and in the state of pennsylvania, natural gas production is up 34% since our election, 34
virtually, every leading democrat, has pledged to entirely eliminate american production of oil, clean coal, natural gas
i don't think somebody's coming into pennsylvania
you know those new petrochemical plants, they don't like them at all
thousands and thousands of jobs, incredible millions of dollars in taxes
how about going to the state of texas
we had one candidate, who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right
beto
remember
so he wanted to get rid of religion, the bible
he wanted to get rid of guns and he wanted to get rid of oil
how about going to texas and say no bible, no oil
think of this one, no bible, no oil, no guns
i think you could be abraham lincoln and not win that particular race and it wouldn't be much different in the state of pennsylvania that i can tell you, but you know somebody that believes in that is sleepy joe biden
he was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in pennsylvania
you saw that, but the voters of this commonwealth will never ever let that happen
can you imagine a guy coming in whether it's him or anybody else
they all want to do it
he just raises his hand
he has no clue what he's doing
there is that   remember he look   you want to give illegal aliens health care, even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up   and he looks and they're all raising their hand
did you see that
well he, oh, oh, oh, ok, i'll do it too
in addition to replacing nafta, i've taken the toughest ever action against china's trade abuses
they want to make a deal so badly
we're doing well with the deal, but they want to make a deal
please make a deal
we don't want to pay tariffs anymore, please, please
thanks to our steel tariffs, steel mills in pennsylvania are roaring back to life and u
steel has just announced a $1 billion investment in mond valley works in pittsburgh
you know that, right
$1 billion
they weren't investing, they were divesting
the steel companies, one of a   it's an amazing achievement
we tax all of the dumped steel, comes in from china and other places, 25%, all of it
all of a sudden, our steel mills are doing again
and we need steel
you know, it's not like you could say, gee, we'll get it from another country
we need that for defense
we need it for our ships, we need it for our planes, we need it
we can't play games with steel
after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation
and, very importantly, in everything we do, we are putting america first
sorry
we gave up at the globalists, folks
you know, let's build the world, let's forget about our country
let's just rebuild the world
oh no, issue have the democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the american people than on the issue of immigration
far left politician, i mean they're fighting me on the wall
you have no idea but we're building it, and it's fine that we have the money coming in from the military
i got three from here, from there, from there believe me
if i weren't a good developer, you could forget about that wall
i got here there, there,  these people fought me and we've started winning in court, and you know what, speaking of court, we will soon have $182 federal judges, including court of appeals, nobody can believe it
all because barack obama gave us 142 empty seats
you know when you're a president, they always say i disagree
i think the most support they can do is defense, right
but beyond defense they always say the most important thing you can do is judges, and justices of the supreme court
we have two great ones, great ones
but they always say judges and supreme court justices and when you leave office, i hope in five years, nine years, 13 years, 17 years, 21 years, 25 years, 29 years, when i leave office
now, i'm only doing that to drive them totally crazy, that drives them crazy
even joking about it
we have this idiot comedian who says up, he's talking to a guest, right
he said, you know he's going to win, don't you
you know it
he's like, no, no, we're going to fight, we're going to fight, and they will
no, no, no, you know he's going to win
then he goes, you know, he's going to win and you know he's never leaving, don't you
he's never leaving
and at first i thought he was kidding
he's a whack job
he is totally serious
he honestly believes that and i don't know
should we give it a shot
maybe we should give it a shot
i'm only kidding
i'm only kidding
media, i'm only kidding
they won't write that, but that's ok
they won't write the i'm-only-kidding part, but far-left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating this sneering contempt, scorn and disdain for everyday americans
these jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous, violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets, where they are free to offend where they are free to kill, where they are free to rape, where they are free to beat up people except for ice because ice is much tougher than that, they don't beat up ice, they don't beat up ice, you're lucky we have ice
they want to put ice out of business, that's not happening
ice is   they're incredible people, they're great patriots and they're tough
thanks to democrat immigration policies, innocent americans at all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals
last summer, at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grisly homicides, including hacking victims to death and ripping out, in two cases, their hearts
weeks ago, two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang ms-13, who we are removing from our country by the thousands we're charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful, beautiful, high school teenager to death, with a baseball, bat and chopping the body, apart with a machete
one of the animals accused, was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ice demand
ice won and said you can't let him go
they wanted him, they would do anything for him
they wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country, get them the hell out of our country, right
democrat sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes
since montgomery county maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in july, we have already identified nine illegal aliens, who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman, who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment
she was raped and killed, strangled to death, sanctuary city maryland, but these are only the cases we know about
sanctuary cities and jails, actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government
federal government wants to take them out or in some cases, if it's real violence and we don't want to pay for the costs, but we do put them into very strong jails
the sanctuary city of philadelphia, a sanctuary city in philadelphia, is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in america
did you know that
i mean, i know philadelphia well going to school here we never heard about sanctuary cities, did we
weeks ago, an illegal alien charged with rape, sexual assault of a child and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by philadelphia to wander free in your communities
and by the way, you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call   this guy   i've been hearing about this guy he lets killers out almost immediately
what the hell
how did you let that happen
instead of handing him over while still in jail, they defied ice, they fought with ice and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family
thankfully, at great time and effort, our brave ice officers were eventually able to track him down, arrest him, detain him and do what has to be done
how do   how do you elect democrats when they create a sanctuary city of philadelphia
i don't get it
four ms-13 gang members were also arrested in pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21 year old and a 15 year old
as we speak, a criminal, illegal, alien with three-prior deportations is roaming free in pennsylvania because he was released by the city of philadelphia, the city of brotherly love
you better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place
i want to tell you that's a horrible thing
no, it's a national story, how he wants everybody to not pay the price and you're talking about not paying the price for rape, for murder for other horrible crimes
how stupid
how stupid can you be
the charges against this elite include rape, aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, indecent exposure, and terroristic threats
other than that he was a very nice person
philadelphia has defied ice and released illegals charged with everything from assault to kidnapping to drug crimes to sex crimes, to homicide, murder
democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos
republicans stand for law and order, and we stand for justice
we stand for justice, we side with law enforcement and with law abiding americans, not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals
aliens that come into our country illegally, they take our payments, payments
some of these people with these crazy laws that you have look at what's going on in california, they do better than our great veterans
they do better than citizens of our country and they advertise
we will take you, we will take care of you, we will pay for it and then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders, but we do a great job
we're removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands, we're sending them home and we're not letting them come back in, we're being very tough and mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border and guatemala, honduras and el salvador
we signed a very important agreement with each
when their people come into our country they weren't taking them back
now
they take them back and they say thank you very much
they weren't taking them back
if we add a murder from honduras, guatemala, el salvador, we want to bring them back under past administrations, they bring them, they said, we don't want them
don't land your plane with us
they say, thank you very much
we will take them back
because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that
thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since may, and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace
the radical democrats have gotten more and more extreme and that's why they did this impeachment hopes, because nancy pelosi had absolutely no control
she knew what was going to happen, she knew
the radical left has taken over the democrat party
democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of health care that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice
we have 180 million people with private health care that love it
they're going to take it away from you
thank you very much, everybody
please
i want to begin by welcoming the first lady with us, today, and the first lady of turkey
thank you very much for being here
this is a great honor to have you
and we had a wonderful and a very productive meeting
and before we start, i would like to thank president erdoğan for releasing detainee serkan golge, who was in detention   in different forms of detention
and i appreciate that very much
that was a very nice tribute
and he'll be coming back at some point in the not-too-distant future
so, that's   that's very good news for the united states and also very good news for turkey
turkey, as everyone knows, is a great nato ally, and a strategic partner of the united states around the world
our economic relationship has tremendous potential and continues to expand and to grow
direct engagement and diplomacy between our nations are essential to ensuring a future of peace, and prosperity, and promise for our citizens
over the course of the day, president erdoğan and i had a frank and productive conversation on a range of very important topics
among those topics we discussed was the situation in syria
last month, i sent vice president pence
secretary of state pompeo is with us
national security advisor o'brien   thank you   to meet with president erdoğan in the hopes of ending all of the hostilities
the negotiations were very successful, and the united states and turkey achieved a tremendous amount on that day
and i think we're working toward getting it better and better
it's a complicated situation
it's been going on for hundreds of years
today, the ceasefire continues to hold
and i want to thank the president for his partnership and cooperation as we work to build a more stable, and peaceful, and prosperous middle east
we've assured each other that turkey will continue to uphold what it's supposed to uphold
i'm a big fan of the president, i have to tell you that
and i know that the ceasefire, while complicated, is moving forward and moving forward at a very rapid clip
there's a lot of people that want to see that work after so many decades and so many centuries, you might say
the united states and turkey are working extensively on many other security issues
turkey has the second-largest armed forces in nato after the united states
and they're a very strong second, i might add
and i'm pleased that turkey has been steadily increasing its defense spending and is very close to the 2-percent-of-gdp range, unlike many of the other countries
at this moment, they're 8 out of the 28 countries that are current, in terms of their obligation, financially
turkey has made a vital contribution to nato's resolute support mission in afghanistan, and its partnership was important to our destruction of the isis caliphate
in fact, just recently, when we took out al-baghdadi   and take him out, we did   turkey knew that we were going over certain areas
they were very, very helpful, and we appreciate that very much
good for both countries
we really appreciate it
we're grateful to president erdoğan and to the citizens of turkey for their cooperation in the constant struggle against terrorism
he fights it like we do
key to our security collaboration is our trade   defense and military equipment program
american foreign military sales to turkey total many billions of dollars, and turkey supplies component parts to many american defense programs
they make parts of the frame, as an example, for the f-35
turkey's acquisition of sophisticated russian military equipment, such as the s-400, creates some very serious challenges for us, and we are talking about it constantly
we talked about it today
we're talking about it in the future
hopefully, we'll be able to resolve that situation
we've asked our secretary of state, and minister of foreign affairs, and our respective national security advisors to immediately work on resolving the s-400 issue
we've also recently agreed to work toward a $100 billion two-way trade agreement   secretary ross is here   and i think we've made tremendous progress on that
we have a lot of trade with turkey, but it could be many times larger   and turkey would like to see that, and it would also be good for the united states
so we intend to bring it up to $100 billion
that would be four times what it is right now
our goal is to expand commerce between the united states and turkey, reduce our trade deficit, and ensure a truly fair and reciprocal relationship
we are, just for those of you that have any interest   we discussed it, today, also   our trade agreement with china is moving along very rapidly
we'll see what happens, but it's moving along rapidly
china wants to make a deal, that i can tell you
one of my chief priorities as president has been removing the barriers to american trade and investment, and ending the illicit practices that harm our workers
we encourage turkey to further open its markets   and they are doing that
they're doing that very much   toward american goods and american services
our markets are open
turkey is opening up their markets and they're opening up rapidly
president, as we have seen in recent weeks, the u
-turkish alliance can be a powerful force for security and stability not only in the middle east, but beyond
i look forward to working with you
and to your representatives, i want to thank you very much all for being here
i've gotten to become very familiar with all of you, and i really appreciate it
you're doing a fantastic job for the people of turkey
and i look forward to continuing to find common ground, harness common purpose, and to advance the vital interests of our people and the abiding friendship between our nations
we have a great relationship, both personally and with the great country of turkey, and we look forward to moving that forward and making it an even bigger and better relationship
thank you very much
thank you
first and foremost, i would like to thank my dear friend, president trump, and the first lady of the united states for being such gracious hosts today
we've managed to comprehensively discuss all the issues in our agendas with mr
president all throughout the day and the discussions were very sincere
we all agree that we need to further profound our cooperation and that turkish-american relations should be erected upon a strong and a very healthy foundation
i think we should remain resolved, in order to open a new chapter in our relations, which are in full compliance with our deeply rooted alliance
we have reciprocally stated our will to fight terrorist organizations imposing a clear and a present danger upon our national security
we have especially underlined the significance of fighting against daesh in a sustained fashion, especially in the aftermath of the demise of baghdadi   the death of baghdadi
we have detained several prisoners trying to flee the prisons in syria and come to turkey, and we currently have more than 200 daesh terrorists who have been incarcerated
and with the operation peace spring initiated on october the 9th, turkey took another step forward in fighting terrorism in a very resolute fashion
our country, with this operation, blew a very significant impact upon the separatist agenda of terrorist organizations, such as pkk and ypg in syria
in order to further strengthen our cooperation in syria, we believe we have gained a significant momentum with our october 17th agreement or memorandum
but in order to harm this memorandum, pkk and ypg are attacking our soldiers and the civilians in a very provocative fashion
and, in the last 24 hours, more than 19 attacks and harassing shots took place
and at the beginning of this month, in tal abyad, a bomb was placed   an explosive device was placed in an outdoor market and, as a result of the explosion, 13 civilian lives were lost
despite all of these developments, in order to settle the conflict in syria in a sustained fashion, we are reiterating our commitment to our memorandum   our agreement with the united states
but some circles who are empathetic towards these terrorist organizations are feeling deeply upset
they are deeply disturbed and they are using this information in order to cloud the understanding of the public opinion and that perception with the eventual gain or goal of harming our relations
and some historical developments and allegations are being used in order to dynamite our reciprocal and bilateral relations
especially in the house of representatives, some of the resolutions that were passed on october 29th served this very purpose and hurt deeply the turkish nation, and they have a potential of casting a deep shadow over our bilateral relations
and i shared this information with mr
president
the decision makers in an incident that took place about 104 years ago should not be politicians, but historians
we have nothing to hide, and we have a full self-esteem in that regard
but i need to state very clearly that we are, as turkey, on the side of dialogue and open discussion and debate
and we have voiced our proposals to the armenian party to open the archives reciprocally and establish a history commission
i believe the senate will take this   take the united states out of this vicious cycle, which happened as a result of the resolution of the house of representatives
turkey and the united states stand side by side in order to fully eradicate daesh and in order to bring peace and stability to syria once and for all
and for this purpose, we should keep on working together
turkey remains, or it should be, the most reliable partner of the united states in this region to achieve these targets
we are the only nato ally, as turkey, who has fought daesh in a very resolved fashion
and until so far, we have detained 7,680 foreign fighters and we have sent them back to their countries of origin
and we have been entry to 77,000 individuals who are considered to be affiliated with daesh terrorist organization
and, right now, in our presence, a total of 1,216 daesh members are incarcerated, coming from 40 different countries
we have quite recently detained 287 individuals, including women and children who have fled the prisons that pkk and ypg used to control
our country is being showcased as a target and this terrorist organization caused 304 turkish citizens to die   and against which we are going to keep on fighting
and it's very important to understand that the foreign fighters should be accepted by the countries of origin
and we have the same understanding with president trump in order to convince the countries of origin to do this
distinguished ladies and gentlemen, we have a border line of 911 kilometers with syria
and when the war broke out, nine years ago, we were the ones at the forefront impacted heavily and maybe the most
currently, we have 3,650,000 syrian refugees and a total of more than 4,000,000 refugees
and we have spent about $40 billion, even beyond that, for these refugees in our country
and until so far, europe only sent €3 billion, despite a higher pledge
through our ngos and, similarly, we are providing sustained humanitarian aid to more than 3 million people living on the syrian territory
back in the year 2015, at the g20 antalya summit, i launched an appeal in order to establish a safe zone in syria
but because of the delay, hundreds of   tens of thousands of civilian lives were lost
this problem cannot continue forever and ever
previously, with our operation euphrates shield and operation olive branch, we have managed to clear an area of 4,000 square kilometers of terrorist presence
and i agree with the proposals of the   of the president
it's very important to realize our goals
i said operation euphrates shield and operation olive branch   and, through these operations, we've managed to repatriate 365,000 syrians back to their motherlands, especially in jarabulus
and thanks to the operation peace spring, we have secured many towns and many villages, and the rightful settlers are going back
we have shared our projects with president trump and our several plans for the safe zone
and with the support of the united nations and international community, we can repatriate many more syrian refugees in the northern part of syria
we're talking about an area of 444 kilometers in length and 32 kilometers in depth
one million people can be repatriated
and in raqqa and deir az-zor, 1 million more individuals can be repatriated
so, a total of 2 million refugees can be repatriated
ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the fethullahist terrorist organization, known as fetö, attempted to destroy the constitutional order of turkey with a failed coup attempt, and it is a terrorist organization behind this failed coup
they have killed 251 individuals, harming 2,193 citizens
and they have even dared to bomb our parliament   airborne
we have once again accentuated our expectations vis-� -vis our friends at the u
administration to once and for all eradicate fetö presence here
and we have also discussed with president trump how to achieve the $100 billion trade-volume threshold as soon as possible
we believe that we should not confuse political incidents with commerce-related aspirations
and our secretaries of commerce are currently heavily invested in achieving the $100 billion threshold
we hope and pray that we will shy away from certain measures which will make it much more challenging for us to reach these targets
and we have also quite naturally discussed our deeply rooted relations in the field of defense industry, primarily the s-400 system and the f-35 program
we can only surmount the hurdles that we experienced through dialogue
my dear friend previously stated, back in osaka at the g20 summit, the injustice orchestrated against turkey, in terms of the acquisition of patriot missiles
and we have clearly stated to president trump that, under suitable circumstances, we could acquire patriot missiles as well
as turkey, we are ready and committed to sustain a very constructive dialogue with the united states congress, and this is an idea that i've shared with president trump as well
so with these thoughts in mind, i hope and pray that our discussions and deliberations all throughout the day with president trump will yield the most auspicious results
i would like to take this opportunity to thank president trump for their kind invitation and for being such gracious hosts all throughout the day
on behalf of my personal self, on behalf of my delegation, i would like to thank you
well, thank you very much, mr
president
and i called up the senate
i asked a couple of our senators
and we really ended up with five   and others wanting to come, and we‘ll keep them apprised
but some of them joined us
they happen to be here
senator jim risch
thank you, jim, very much
ted cruz, thank you very much
lindsey graham
lindsey, thank you
and rick scott
thank you, rick, very much
joni is here   joni ernst   someplace
these are people that want to see peace in the middle east and i thought it would be appropriate to have them come over
and they met with the president and we had a lot of very frank discussion
and we're dealing with a very big subject   a complex subject
it's been going on for centuries, in many cases
but we're making a lot of progress   tremendous progress in the middle east
okay, a couple of questions
go ahead, oan
go ahead
thank you
are you talking about the witch hunt
is that what you mean
is that what you're talking about
i hear it's a joke
i haven't watched
i haven't watched for one minute because i've been with the president, which is much more important, as far as i'm concerned
this is a sham and shouldn't be allowed
it was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn't have allowed it to happen
i want to find out who is the whistleblower because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information, including my call with the president of ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate
and he wrote something that was much different than the fact
i want to find out why the ig   why would he have presented that, when, in fact, all he had to do was check the call itself and he would have seen it
i'm going to be releasing   i think, on thursday   a second call, which actually was the first of the two
and you'll make a determination as to what you think there
but i've heard   just a report   they said it's all third-hand information
nothing direct at all
it can't be direct because i never said it
and all they have to do is look very, very simply at the transcript
if you read the transcript   this was analyzed by great lawyers
this was analyzed by gregg jarrett
it was analyzed by mark levin
it was analyzed by everybody
they said this statement that i made   the whole call that i made with the president of ukraine was a perfect one
so   that this country gets put through that, that we have to waste this gentleman's time by even thinking about it, talking about it   i'd much rather focus on peace in the middle east
and i hear that it's   i hear that it's a hoax, and it's being played as a hoax
that's what i hear, but you'll have to tell me
go ahead
yeah
well, no
i think that, frankly, europe should be paying for this, to a large extent
as of this moment, turkey has been paying for most of it
i think the president was saying today, they've spent over $40 billion on the cost of that   $40 billion
forty
that's what i said
whatever
he spent a lot, okay
they're giving   they're throwing out all these different numbers
i heard it was $40 billion
how was that   $40 billion
correct
so, $40 billion
and i've heard that number from others
and that's a lot
europe has contributed about €3
and a lot of these people would go all throughout europe
i mean, it would be a   a devastating situation for europe, because he's got 4 million people
he has a lot of kurds, too, that they're helping and taking care of
so, i have spoken to europe about it
i think they should help us with isis because many of them left france and they left germany and they left uk   they left different countries
and these countries should help us because if they ever did get released, which we won't be doing   but if they ever did get released, that's where they want to go
they want to go back to france and germany and uk and all of those other countries that are not helping us
i gave them the option, would you like to have them back
and, intelligently, they said, no, thank you
but that's not right and it's not fair
i can tell you also that turkey captured   when they   some escaped during the conflict, when they had the heavy shooting
and, i mean, i think i know how they happened to escape, but it's one of those things
doesn't matter, because turkey captured everybody that escaped, plus an additional group
when we took over, when i became president, isis was rampant all over the middle east
and, as of about a month ago, i think, lindsey, we can say that we have now 100 percent of the caliphate
and they'll always try and grow, but they haven't been able to do that
and what we did last week with al-baghdadi   who is the absolute founder, leader   set them back
we also got his number two, and we have our sights on his number three
so, they're not going to be growing too fast
but i will say, turkey has been helping us a lot
thank you very much
would you like to pick somebody
a friendly person from turkey, please
friendly
only friendly reporters we like to see
there aren't
too many of them around
thank you
well, i had a very good talk with him
we had a very good   recently
and we're working very closely together, and we're also working very closely together with your great president
and a lot of things are happening
a lot of very positive developments are happening
a lot of that is definition
what's your definition of the various groups within the kurds   you call the kurds   and then you have various groups
and some like them, and some don't
but i think we've made a tremendous amount of   we've gained a tremendous amount of momentum and strength and knowledge over the last short period of time
so, we'll see what happens
but i will say that the relationship with president erdoğan and turkey has been outstanding
and, you know, it's a major country with a tremendous military
they're one of our very big purchasers of military equipment
they have the finest equipment in the world, which the united states makes
we make, by far, the best equipment in the world
turkey understood that a long time ago
so, i think a tremendous amount of progress is being made
okay
thank you very much
you could ask the president a question, now
same reporter
you're sure you're a reporter
you don't work for turkey with that question
fox, please
i know nothing about that
first time i've heard it
the one thing i've seen that sondland said was that he did speak to me for a brief moment, and i said, no quid pro quo under any circumstances
and that's true
and the other   i'd never heard this
in any event, it's more secondhand information, but i've never heard it
i don't recall
no, not at all
not even a little bit
the only thing   and i guess sondland has stayed with testimony that there was no quid pro quo
pure and simple
yes, please
president, please
yup
thank you very much
i appreciate that
right
well, thank you very much
and i will say that we've had a great relationship with the kurds
and we fought with them very successfully against isis
we fought together
we had   we have great generals and we have great equipment, and it's certainly helped a lot
but we were very, very successful
and we captured, as i said before, 100 percent
i was going to   when we were at 97 percent, i was going to say, well, that sounds pretty high to me
and i was thinking about stopping it then
and a lot of people said, please, go to 100
and very quickly, very rapidly, the military got the 100
i wanted to have that
but we have a great relationship with the kurds   we have had
we're with them now
we get along with them
and, by the way, i think the president, he may have some factions within the kurds, but i think the president has a great relationship with the kurds
many kurds live currently in turkey
and they're happy and they're taken care of, including healthcare   we were talking about it before   including healthcare and education and other things
so that's really a misnomer
but our relationship with the kurds has been a very good one
okay
thank you
what are they
pyd and ypg   which are offshoots of the terrorist organization, pkk
just as we have no problems with our brothers and sisters in the northern part of iraq, where we enjoy great relations, and we have no problems with, similarly, our brothers and sisters in the northern part of syria, during the times when assad was not recognizing the kurdish presence in the northern part, i told him that he needs to give these individuals passports and that he was making a mistake
and secondly, there is something really important
i want you to know this
my political party has more than 50 mps of kurdish ethnicity in the turkish parliament
we don't have problems with the kurds, but we have problems with the terrorists
and, of course, you're not going to own up to the terrorists, are you   whoever they are, whoever they might be
but we have to make a distinction here
we're just fighting terrorists, period
because the terrorists don't have an ethnicity, they don't have a nationality, they don't have a flag
if they're terrorists, that is a terrorist
if you don't fight back, then tomorrow you will have to pay a very hefty price
thank you
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
thank you very much
well, thank you very much, barbara
so sad that this is live
she said it's live
it's always live
there's always somebody with a phone
it becomes live
ask a lot of politicians that are no longer in politics
i want to thank marie-josée kravis for your incredible leadership of the club
it's an honor to be here
it is wonderful also to be back in new york with so many friends and distinguished leaders in business, in finance, academia, and, i have to add, in real estate
all my real estate friends are here
i'm especially grateful for, and to, your longtime club members, because it's a club with a tremendous reputation
and somebody doing a absolutely incredible job as director of the national economic council, a friend of mine who i got on   i've been hearing this voice for 35 years
it's driving me crazy
larry kudlow
always calm
always cool
and he's just larry, and he's terrific   i'll tell you that
three years ago, i came to speak before this storied forum as a candidate for president
and at that time, america was stuck in a failed recovery and saddled with a bleak economic future
and it was bleak
under the last administration, nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost
almost 5 million more americans had left the labor force, and jobs were not exactly what you would call plentiful
and 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls
in 2016, the department of labor predicted that americans would continue dropping out of the workforce in record numbers
they predicted and projected a decade of sluggish growth, and they expected unemployment over 5 percent   and, really, 6, 7, and even, in some cases, 8 percent   for many years to come
the so-called experts said the americans had no choice but to accept stagnation, decay, and a shrinking middle class as the new normal
that was said all the time
in short, the american people were told to sit back and accept a slow, inevitable decline
but i never believed for one moment that our magnificent nation was destined for a diminished future
i knew that our destiny was in our own hands
that we could choose to reject a future of america and, really, look at a future of american decline unacceptable, and to build a future of american dominance, which is what i wanted
it couldn't be any other way, or i would have never done this
i refused to accept that americans had to lower their expectations or give up on their dreams
america is the single greatest country in the world, and i knew that working together we could make it even greater
in 2016, i stood before you supremely confident in what our people could achieve if government stopped punishing american workers and started promoting american workers and american companies
our middle class was being crushed under the weight of a punitive tax code, oppressive regulations, one-sided trade deals, and an economic policy that put america's interest last, and a very deep last at that
i knew that if we lifted these burdens from our economy, and unleashed our people to pursue their ambitions and realize their limitless potential, then economic prosperity would come thundering back to our country at a record speed
and that's what's happening
today, i'm proud to stand before you as president of the united states to report that we have delivered on our promises and exceeded our expectations by a very wide margin
we have ended   thank you
i was waiting for that
thank you
i was waiting for that
i almost didn't get it
we have ended the war on american workers, we have stopped the assault on american industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before
i did this despite a near-record number of rate increases and quantitative tightening by the federal reserve since i won the election   eight increases in total   which were, in my opinion, far too fast an increase and far too slow a decrease
because remember, we are actively competing with nations who openly cut interest rates so that now many are actually getting paid when they pay off their loan   known as negative interest
who ever heard of such a thing
give me some of that
give me some of that money
i want some of that money
our federal reserve doesn't let us do it
i don't say   thank you
thank you
the smart people are clapping
only the smart people are clapping
i don't say that's good for the world   i'm not president of the world
i'm president of our country   but we are competing against these other countries nonetheless, and the federal reserve doesn't let us play at that game
it puts us at a competitive disadvantage to other countries
yet, in the face of this reality, our economic policies have ushered in an unprecedented tide of prosperity surging all throughout the nation
we're paying interest
by other comparisons, we're paying, actually, high interest
we should be paying, by far, the lowest interest, and yet we're doing better than any nation, by far, on earth
the extraordinary numbers tell the story
back in 2016, before i took office, the congressional budget office projected that fewer than 2 million jobs would be created by this time in 2019
instead, my administration has created nearly 7 million jobs, and going up rapidly
we beat predictions   thank you
we beat predictions more than three times the highest estimate that i saw during the campaign
nobody thought it was even possible to get close to a 7 million number
two million was maxed out, if you were lucky and if you did a great job
unemployment has recently achieved the lowest rate in 51 years
african american unemployment, hispanic american unemployment, and asian american unemployment, have all reached the lowest rates in history
women's unemployment, the best numbers in 71 years
we expect that that number of 71 years   which isn't good compared to the other numbers, is it
but women also will soon be historic, we think
blue-collar jobs are leading the way in our middle class boom
we've added 25,000 mining jobs, 128,000 energy jobs, and 1
2 million manufacturing and construction jobs
and manufacturing was supposed to be dead in our country
you would need, according to a past administration representative at the highest level of that past administration   you would need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing jobs
well, we brought them back, and we brought them back to over 600,000 manufacturing jobs as of today
and those are very important jobs
nearly 7 million people have been lifted off, very importantly, food stamps
seven million people off of food stamps
and we're getting americans off of welfare and back into the workforce
nearly 2
5 million americans have risen out of poverty
that's a record
the rate of african american and hispanic american families in poverty has plummeted to the lowest level ever recorded, by far
and most of you people wouldn't know these numbers because most of you aren't very active in the market
but since my election, the s&p 500 is up over 45 percent, the dow jones is up over 50 percent, and the nasdaq is up 60 percent, slightly more
and if we had a federal reserve that worked with us, you could have added another 25 percent to each one of those numbers   i guarantee you that
that doesn't happen
but we all make mistakes, don't we
not too often
we do make them on occasion
american markets have vastly outpaced the rest of the world
this exceptional growth is boosting 401(k)s, pensions, and college savings accounts for millions and millions of hardworking families
you hear so much about inequality and all of the differences and all of the problems
the single biggest benefactors of what we've done are middle-class workers and low-income families
it's been amazing, actually
altogether, we've added nearly $10 trillion of new value to our economy
that's in a short period of time
remember, i only use numbers from the time of the election because i can't go to january 20th
it's not fair
we picked up tremendous stock market and economic numbers
they actually went wild the day after i won
i think that should be attributed to us, not attributed to somebody else, because it would've gone in the opposite direction
it would've gone in the opposite direction had the other result taken place, which, fortunately, it didn't
last year, gdp growth matched the fastest rate in more than a decade, and it was the best of the g7 countries by far
by far
perhaps most importantly   after years of stagnation and decline   american wages, salaries, and incomes are rising very fast
median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country
the average median income under president bush rose only $400 over an eight-year period
under president obama, it rose $975 over an eight-year period
and under my administration, it rose $5,000 over slightly more than just two and a half years
that's a big difference
and if you remember, president obama was paying zero percent interest for a long period of time, while we're paying a much higher rate of interest
but in addition to the $5,000, we have to add $2,200 for the tax cuts   average tax cuts   and $2,000 to $3,000 for regulatory and energy cuts
so that would be a total of almost $10,000 versus $400 and versus $975
so, that's something
so you have, over eight years, you have $400
over eight years, you have $975
over two and a half years   we're almost up to three   but this was done and calculated only as of two and a half, and it's only gone up since then   we're at almost $10,000
so, our consumers, because of this, are in the best shape, probably, in the history of our country
and i think it's going to be very long lasting
very, very long lasting
this also allows me the latitude and timing to take some of the horrible, incompetent, just terrible trade deals that have been made over the years, and make them great
it's like make america great again   make the trade deals great
i don't know if i can use the word again
make them great
period
because i don't think they were ever any good
i haven't seen it
we were great and then we weren't so great, but we're great again
and, by the way, on jobs   just now   i'm glad this is today because, just now, they just announced we have the highest number of people working in our country in the history of our country
almost 160 million people
we've never been close to that number
so, we've achieved this stunning turnaround because we've adopted a new economic policy that finally puts america first
as president, i understand and embrace the fact that the world is a place of fierce competition
we're competing against other nations for jobs and industry, growth and prosperity
factories and businesses will always find a home
it's up to us to decide whether that home will be in a foreign country, or right here in our country, our beloved usa
and that's where we want them to stay, and be, and move to
if we want our families and communities to prosper, america must be the best place on earth to work, invest, innovate, build, pursue a career, hone a craft, or start a business
we want companies to move to america, stay in america, and hire american workers
my mission is to put our country on the very best footing to thrive, excel, compete, and to win
for many years, our leaders in washington did the exact opposite
they imposed the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world
so high that people couldn't even understand what they were doing and they would leave
very, very smart executives didn't want to leave, but they would leave, sending our jobs and everything else all a flutter
they waged an unethical regulatory assault on the american people
they tried to shut down american energy
and, by the way, they're still trying
you want to see energy shut down
take a look at what i'm competing against on the other side
i don't think they even believe in energy
so far, i haven't found any form of energy that's acceptable to them
i think they think the factories are just going to work without energy, don't they
they don't have a clue, these people
but i don't want to mention it yet
i want to wait a little bit longer
let them go a little bit further so they can't take it back, because as a campaign, i like it
i like it very much
let them keep talking
every time they talk, i say, boy, this looks like it might be easier than i anticipated
they passed the disastrous trade deals that encouraged the shuttering of american plants and the offshoring of american jobs by the millions
in short, the failed political class sold out american workers, sold out american prosperity, and sold out the american dream
this was the alarming situation i was elected to end
and ending, it's never that easy
and you see that
you do have people that want to keep it going that way, but they're losing and they're losing now rapidly and fast
those days are gone, and we're not going back
as you know, one of the key insights of economics is the power of incentives
unlike past leaders, my goal is to ensure that this power works for america's favor and for america's workers and for america's companies
we want the incentives created by our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies to be pro-growth, pro-worker, and 100 percent pro-american
and more is yet to come
if we take back the house in 2020 and retain the senate and the white house, you will see things that even this room   and you've experienced a lot of great times over the last two and a half years, but even you will be surprised to see
we have tremendous economic potential
we have tremendous potential
we have tremendous economic potential
at the heart of our economic revival is the biggest tax cut and reforms in american history
we provided massive relief for working families, saving $2,000 a year for a typical family of four
to bring jobs back, we lowered our business tax rate from the highest tax rate in the developed world down to a very competitive number
not quite the lowest, but getting close
and we may even be able to get there one day not too   in the not-too-distant future
and, by the way, we're taking in more tax revenue with these greatly reduced rates   21 percent
and it was 39 percent, but when you added everything else, it was well into the 40s, and you couldn't bring your money back, because that was prohibitive
both ministerially and from an economic standpoint, the rate was so high
but we brought it down to a level that we're very proud of and we think we can bring it down still more
and yet, we're raising   we have more tax revenues coming into our treasury than we've ever had before
that tells you something right there
since then, nearly $1 trillion have returned to our shores where that money belongs
couldn't get it back
no matter what you did, you couldn't do it
it was not only the rate being so high, but the bureaucracy, the documents, the signings
nobody could do it
to promote investment in distressed american communities, our tax plan created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, which are one of the biggest successes that you've ever seen
i don't think there has ever been anything like it
worked with tim scott   senator tim scott of south carolina   and many of the great senators that we do work with and, frankly, congress, and we passed something that nobody thought was possible to get passed, and nobody thought it could ever work the way it is
capital gains on long-term investments are now taxed in an opportunity zone at zero, and money is flooding in
investment is pouring into these long-neglected communities
the government wasn't putting money in
nobody was
they were dying
and now tremendous   they call it neighborhood push
it's incredible what's happening
it's one of the   it's not spoken of by the fake news media, but they should speak about it, because i will tell you, it's one of the great successes that we've all had
and it's employing tremendous numbers of people
and you have communities that were down and totally out, and they're reviving like nobody has ever seen
opportunity zones
remember those two words
we believe in no american left behind, and we understand the enormous power of investment, capital, and opportunity to revitalize communities and bring hope where it is needed the most
to liberate our economy, my administration launched the biggest, boldest, and most ambitious campaign to reduce regulation
nobody has ever come close
no administration has ever come close
in two and a half years, we've done far more than any other administration, whether it was four years, eight years, or in one case, more than eight years
nobody has come close to doing what we've done with regulations
and i happen to think, as great as the tax cut was   the largest in our history   i really happen to think that the regulation cuts may have had an even bigger impact on the economy
and it was quicker because we were able to do them very early in the administration   earlier than the tax cuts
within days of taking office, i issued an executive order to end the outstanding, horrible federal intrusions that you saw   it was an onslaught   into business, into people's lives
and it was really done by unelected bureaucrats
they were really accountable, and nobody held them accountable
and sometimes, it's not pleasant to hold them accountable, but i do it
i do it
and we had no choice, because we were going nowhere, fast
my order required that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated
but instead of two for one, we have now eliminated nine for one
and we think that, within the next six months, it will be close to twenty for one instead of two for one
and it sounds like a lot, but you have no idea, when you look at the piles and piles and piles of regulation, on each one of our   our great secretaries, we've had some   we have some great people working here
but you go into rooms that are half the size of this, and they would literally be stacked to the ceiling with regulations
nobody has ever seen anything like it
and we have actually, i think, a fairly long way to go
we need regulation, but it has to be smart regulation
highways were taking 20 years to get built, to get approved
you'd put in a application
20, 21 years later, they'd reject it
it would cost many, many times more   25, 30, 40 times more
but they were taking 20 years
we're trying to get that down to one
and it may get rejected, and that's okay
but you haven't spent 20 years on environmental impact statements in order to build a simple highway or roadway that's desperately needed
so we have it down close to one year
we want to hit the one-year number
and if it doesn't work, we're going to reject it
but it's going to be rejected fast
swiftly
but mostly, it's not going to be rejected
we ended the ridiculous waters of the united states rule
what a beautiful name
the name was beautiful
the act was a disaster
it didn't allow you to do anything
when i signed it, i said, you know, waters of the united states   what could be a more beautiful title
i'm going to get killed when i sign this
to kill it
i had to kill it
it was   it made land development prohibitive
it made impossible situations for farmers, for everybody
and i had 35 people in my office   farmers, and builders, and ranchers, and others
strong people, very strong   men and women   and almost all of them were crying
they said, you've given our life back
these laws were horrible
they took away everything
you would have a puddle in your land, and they would call it   you were under river control, you were under lake control, for what is called a puddle
you couldn't get anywhere near it
and if you did, you'd literally be arrested
we're streamlining approvals for critical infrastructure
our regulatory roadblock  is also leading to major price reductions in healthcare and prescription drugs
we've gotten the prescription drugs down
first time in 53 years that prescription drug prices have gone down
and if we had help from the democrats, which we do not have   you possibly have noticed that   we would have   we would be able to cut prescription drugs by 30, 40, and 50 percent
i've told some of the governors   ron desantis in florida   go buy them from other countries
i'm okay with it
i'm going to give them an executive order, because canada and other countries sell the exact same drug from the exact same factory for sometimes 50, 60, and 70 percent less than we do
and rather than going through the political charade and all of the things where   the middleman   i hope we don't have any middlemen in here, because somebody is not going to like me too much
we have a middleman   any middlemen
i think they have to be the richest people in the world, if you want to know the truth
they make far more than the drug companies, in most cases
but i said, buy it from other companies   countries
you go out to other countries
and what's happening already is the companies are coming back, and they want to make great deals, because now i'm giving the right to governors to go to canada, go to england, go all over   go all over europe, where the prices are so much less
because we were forced to pay for all research and development, and they didn't pick up any of the cost
ridiculous rules
so unfair to our country
i said, buy them from other countries and pass along the savings
the savings will be staggering
and we're starting that program
but as soon as we start that program, watch what happens with the drug prices
they'll come down over here
because it's the same companies that make the drugs
the exact same companies
hard to believe
altogether, our regulatory cuts, as mentioned, save american households thousands and thousands of dollars every year
the foundation of american liberty and prosperity has always been the rule of law
throughout history, economies have failed when the rule of law is abandoned
that's why we must protect the constitutional rule of law in our country at all costs
so important
we've got some lawless people in some very high positions
they're lawless
for this reason, we have now appointed, as of today, 161   and fully approved   brand-new federal judges, court of appeals judges, to interpret our constitution as written
that will soon be 182 judges
and, as you know, two supreme court justices, who are great gentlemen, both   both fully in and making some very big decisions, even today, as we speak
the 161, 162 that we have now   we'll be at 182 within two months
and then we normalize, meaning we go through the normal system
when i came into office, one of the first things i said was, how many federal judges do i have to appoint
because i always heard it was the single-most important thing a president can do   federal judges and supreme court justices
they said, sir, you have 142
i said, what
because i was always told you would never have any
maybe you'd have one or two, maybe three if the previous president wasn't doing a good job
but they said, you have 142
i said, you have to be kidding
and we did
we had 142
and we've added to that through different things
and we will be at 182
that will be a record
nobody has ever done that before
it was shocking
but i just want to say
thank you very much, president obama
we appreciate it very much, for the 142
thank you
and i'm sure his party is thrilled with him
but if they aren't, they won't say anything
don't worry about it
thanks to these and other policies, last year, the world economic forum recognized the united states as the globe's most competitive economy
we've put it back into this position where we are competitive like no other nation
to fuel our economic boom, we are bolding   and boldly pursuing american energy independence
and you see that in the middle east, where ships are at great danger
and they keep saying, what happened to the american ships
they don't see too many american ships over there anymore
do you notice that
we stopped the radical crusade to dismantle u
energy production and empower rogue regimes
we withdrew from the one-sided, horrible, horrible, economically unfair, close your businesses down within three years, don't frack, don't drill, we don't want any energy   the horrible paris climate accord that killed american jobs and shielded foreign polluters
it was a disaster for this country
ask them, how are they doing in paris with your paris accord
not too good
and i will tell you, when i signed   that was another one   clean waters of the united states   well, the paris accord, too   and i said, this is going to take guts
i just closed my eyes and i signed it
i got one day of a big hit from some of the radical-left newspapers
and then after that, everybody thanks me
they thank me so profusely
you're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars of destruction would have been done to our country with the paris climate accord
and it is so unfair
it doesn't kick in for china until 2030
russia goes back into the 1990s, where the base year was the dirtiest year ever in the world
india, we are supposed to pay them money because they are a developing nation
i said, we're a developing nation, too
why aren't we… under the wto, china is called a developing nation
so we wrote them a letter recently
larry knows it
i'm not sure larry liked the idea too much, but he went along with it
we wrote them a very tough letter, larry, and we said
what
oh, larry wrote it
he said   boy, you hopped on that bandwagon quickly, didn't you
that's okay
but we wrote them a letter and we said, much more strongly than the letter, that   not fair to have china as a developing nation
one of the reasons they've taken advantage of us is because of that
and we're considered the big, fat cow
and no longer
no longer
we have a lot of things to work out
and i will say this
because they know that i'm very tentative on the wto, we're winning cases for the first time
we just won a 7
5 billion-dollar case
we never won cases
they'd rule against us because they said, hey, don't worry about the united states
they're the stupid people
don't worry
rule against them
keep rule-   we had case after case
now, we're winning cases, because they really think that i'll do something very powerful, which we have the right to do
and they're right when they think that way
and we're winning a lot of cases at the wto level, we never   that we never even would have thought of winning before
america is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas on the entire planet earth
net energy imports   net energy imports   this is so great   set a historic low
it's a 58-year low, but that's only because they only go back 58 years, meaning, i assume if it's low now, it's lower than it used to be, unless something happened that's very strange back then
but it's at a historic low
we are now a net exporter of natural gas, and we recently became a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products for the first time in our country's history
it's a big thing
according to the council of economic advisers, the astonishing increase in production, made possible by the shale revolution, saves americans $2,500 for a family of four in lowering electric bills and prices at the pump
and the number is actually now even higher than that
my administration is also restoring the principle that to be a strong nation, america must be a manufacturing nation
these are great jobs
these are brilliant, great people that know how to manufacture
these people were under-appreciated and under-taken care of
but we take care of them
we cherish them
past leaders wrote off american manufacturing as dead, but their policies were the ones that were actually killing it
we killed manufacturing
that's why we were losing all those jobs, because we made it impossible to manufacture
we opened it all up
after losing   and this is a number that's hard to believe, and i've been saying it for three years, and i know it's right because the fake news has never corrected me
if it was wrong, it would have been headlines
trump made a mistake
but they can't say it
after losing 60,000   can you believe that
factories under the previous two administrations, america is now gaining over 10,000 brand-new, beautiful factories, and many, many more than that want to come back in
because under my administration, we're producing jobs and incentives for these companies to come back
i'm calling, as an example, prime minister abe of japan
and i say, mr
prime minister, shinzo, we have a tremendous problem
we have big deficits with your country
you've got to start building plants
he's building many, many car plants now in the united states that he would've never built here if you didn't have this kind of a president
and he's very happy to be doing it
but they're all coming back to the united states
they want to be where the action is
very simple
they want to be where the action is
this is where the action is
there's nobody close
there's no country close
when i meet with the leaders of countries, as they come in   kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators   i meet them all
anybody who wants to come in   dictators, it's okay, come on in
whatever is good for the united states
we want to help our people
but the first thing they say to me almost always
congratulations on your economy
they all say it
congratulations, it's incredible what's happened to your country
it's incredible what's happened to your economy
first thing they say in almost every instance
but central to this comeback is a series of bold initiatives to reform a broken system of international trade
we want thriving commerce with as many countries as possible, but trade must be fair, and to me, it must be my favorite word, reciprocal
it's not reciprocal
we're getting it to be much more reciprocal
the american market is the most valuable and coveted market anywhere in the world
those who want access must play by the rules, and they have to respect our game and our laws, and they have to treat our workers and businesses fairly   not the way they've been treating them over the last 25 years
america will not be taken advantage of anymore
many countries charge us extraordinarily high tariffs or create impossible trade barriers
impossible
and i'll be honest
european union   very, very difficult
the barriers they have up are terrible
terrible
in many ways, worse than china
we're working on legislation known as the united states reciprocal trade act, meaning quite simply
what's good for them is good for us
if they want to charge us, we charge them
it's a very simple thing
even people that aren't well versed in what we all do say   i went to a couple of senators   went to lindsey graham
i said, lindsey, let me ask you
what do you think of that
they're charging us 100 percent
we'll charge them… that makes sense to me
it really does
it makes sense to everybody because it's very unfair the way we're treated by certain countries
there are certain countries that the average tariff is over 100 percent
and we charge them nothing
and then they call it fair trade
that's not fair trade
that's stupid trade
of course, this will be subject to regaining the house, to be able to do these things
nowhere has the change in u
strategy been more vital or dramatic than in our dealings with respect to china
before my election, washington politicians stood by and did nothing while china ransacked our companies, stole our intellectual property, subsidized their industries at the expense of ours, and dumped their products in a deliberate strategy to close american factories all across our land
for many years, americans   leaders have just sat back
maybe they didn't understand what was going on
it's impossible to believe that
but they just let it happen
and it's gotten worse and worse and worse
and now we've changed it
it's changed a lot
i'm sure you haven't noticed, but it's changed a lot
in particular, since china's entrance into the world trade organization in 2001, no one has manipulated numbers better or taken advantage of the united states more
and i won't use this word, cheated
i will not say the word, cheated
but nobody has cheated better than china, but i will not say that
we'll say that off the record, okay
and there's only about 600 cameras back there
in fact, that is a big group up there
good
i hope you use it because it's true
and they understand it's true
and i don't blame china, by the way
i blame our leaders, because we should've been doing what they were doing
they did it to use
we didn't do it to them
we were defenseless
we had no leadership
this was for a long time
this is long beyond the obama administration
so i don't blame them
i said this to president xi
i was making a big speech in china
i had 5,000 people in front of me and i was talking about how bad china was
and i said, this is not going over well
i was in beijing   this massive hall
and i looked down at president xi
he was sitting right where larry is
he was not as imposing a figure as larry kudlow, but he was quite imposing
and i said   i said, you know, i think he's getting very angry
and i then i realized, hmm, how do we save this
this is going to be a disastrous afternoon
and i said, but i don't blame china
i blame our leaders
and then i realized, that's true
i blame our leaders for allowing it to happen
i've told that to you and many people many times
but the theft of american jobs and american wealth is over
they understand that
my administration has taken the toughest-ever action to confront china's trade abuses
we are taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs that china is paying for
we're not paying
china is paying because they're devaluing their currency to such an extent and they're pouring tremendous amounts of cash into their system
they're having their worst year in more than 57 years, more than half a century
their supply chains are cracking very badly, and they are dying to make a deal
we're the ones that are deciding whether or not we want to make a deal
we're close
a significant phase one trade deal with china could happen
it could happen soon
but we will only accept a deal if it's good for the united states and our workers and our great companies, because we've been hit very hard
we'd have deficits for many years   go back many years   $500 billion a year
not million
five hundred million dollars a year is a lot
five hundred billion dollars a year in trade deficits with china
and we have it with many other countries, just not nearly as large
china probably makes up almost 60 percent of our deficits
we also renegotiated the last administration's failed trade agreement with south korea
it was a terrible agreement
our new agreement doubles the number of american cars that can be sold to south korea under the u
standards, and it keeps america's 25 percent import tax, known as the chicken tax, on small trucks, which was all ready to disappear
it was going to disappear
the deal from the previous administration was projected by them to add 250,000 jobs, and they were right
it did add 250,000 jobs
unfortunately, the jobs went to south korea, not to the united states
that's what we got stuck with
we also struck a deal, which is historic, with japan   it's just partial because we're having very tough negotiations and strong negotiations with japan   to substantially reduce barriers for american agriculture and facilitate $40 billion in digital trade and agricultural purchases
that deal was signed, and it's a great deal but it's only phase one of the japan deal, too
a lot of these leaders don't like me too much, folks
when you hear that i'm not so popular in various countries, please don't accept that as, gee, he doesn't have a good personality
just realize what i'm trying to do for you
it's about time
okay
please
they recently came out with a poll that president obama is much more popular in germany than i am
i said, guess what
he should be
he should be
the day i'm more popular than him, you know i'm not doing my job
let's put it that way
because we're treated very badly by countries
they take advantage of us, and they have for many, many years
it's hard to break that cycle
but we're breaking it and we're getting along with them, believe it or not
we're actually   i think they respect us far more today than they ever have, if you want to know the truth
we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever in history, nafta, with a brand-new u
-mexico-canada agreement   a historic win for american farmers, energy producers, and manufacturers
and the reason it's such a good deal for us is, i said, listen, if you don't sign this deal, we're going to charge you tariffs on your product coming into the united states, including all of those cars that are now manufactured in mexico
thirty percent of our business was lost over the last 20 years
it went to mexico
and i said, so, if you don't sign it   so it's a good agreement, we're going to just charge you tariffs
and they signed everything we wanted
the usmca will create up to half a million american jobs and add at least 1
2 percent more to our total gdp
and it should be much higher than that
yet, democrats in washington would rather pursue outrageous hoaxes and delusional witch hunts   which are going absolutely nowhere
don't worry about it   than pass the usmca and deliver real stuff for the american workers
it's a great bill   usmca
and put pressure on the democrats
there's tremendous pressure already
and, most of them, if you had a vote today, i think most of them would actually vote for it
but nancy pelosi   nervous nancy   has to put it out there and sign
and if she doesn't, she's doing her party a tremendous disservice, and she's doing this country a tremendous disservice
as we create millions of new jobs, we are also transforming lives
under the last administration, nearly 1
8 million americans in their prime-working years simply gave up   they gave up   looking for work altogether and dropped out of the labor force
under my administration, 2 million prime-age americans have come off the sidelines already   people that we thought maybe would never work again   and they've fully rejoined the labor force
something we're very proud of
and this includes a group that was having a hard time from the day of our founders   the day they signed, these people have had a hard time
they're former inmates   people that went to jail   who are getting a fresh start thanks to the landmark criminal justice reform bill that i signed into law, but maybe equally so because the economy is so good
they're coming out of jail now and they're getting jobs
and i will tell you, the people that have been hiring them   and i get reports   they cannot believe how good they've been, and obviously, not in all cases
but it's incredible
first time they've ever had an opportunity
they get out of jail, and they end up with a great job
and they cherish the job more than you would, more than i would
they cherish   they can't believe what happened to them
and they're doing a phenomenal job
first time it's ever happened in the history of our country
it's really terrific
when we say, hire american, we mean hire all americans
by focusing on the needs of people, not the desires of government, we're helping our citizens realize their ambitions and pursue rewarding careers
over 1
1 million fewer americans are now forced to rely on part-time work today than when i was elected
that's a tremendous number
people were working two jobs, and three jobs, and making less money than they made 21 years ago
that was the stat
a record number of americans are quitting the job that they have to take a job they like even better
they like the job better
they like getting up in the morning, like we all do
they like going to work
and they have something that they can do, and they're getting paid more money for it, which is something that's probably never happened before in this country to the extent it's happened now
this increased competition is driving up wages for blue-collar workers who are the biggest beneficiaries of what we're talking about and all the things that i'm mentioning today
real weekly wages for the lowest-paid earners have grown more in the first three years of my administration than in the entire decade before my election   and decade and much more than that
since the election, real wages have gone up 3
2 percent for the median american worker
but for the bottom income group, real wages are soaring   a number that's never happened before   9 percent
and that means you might make a couple of bucks less in your companies
you know what
that's okay
that's okay
this is a great thing for our country when you talk about equality
this is a great thing for our country
our tight labor market is helping them the most
yet, democrats in washington want to erase these gains through an extreme policy of open borders, flooding the labor market, and driving down incomes for the poorest americans, and driving crime right through the roof
they want nothing to do with looking at the people that are coming in
and some very, very bad people are trying to get in
but we're building the wall
it's going up rapidly
we have tremendous help from mexico, despite what you read
it was a terrible thing that you read over the last period of a few days, but also, over the last years
but they have 27,000 soldiers on our border now protecting us from people coming into our country
and because of that, i'm not tariffing mexican goods
so, it works out well for everyone
but we have 27,000 mexican soldiers
and they play by different rules than our people
if our people speak rudely to a person coming in, it means they get the electric chair
it's a very unfair situation
our border   our border is so   our laws are so bad   our immigration laws
it's so sad
we have what's called loopholes
many loopholes
i could fix them in 15 minutes, but the democrats don't want to fix them, for two reasons
they don't want to give us a win
and, honestly, i think they maybe just don't care
and it would solve all of the problems and you wouldn't need mexico's help
but we want to thank mexico
we want to thank the president
and i've likewise offered a lot of help because they have a tremendous problem with the cartels in their country   a problem like nobody would believe, where the cartels are almost ruling a country
and i am offering to the president of mexico the ultimate hand
and he and i have a very good relationship, and let's ultimately see what happens
but those cartels are horrible   what they're doing
you see it every day
all you have to do is turn on the news
i want people to come to our country, but they must come in legally and they must come through a system of merit
we now know all of our obligations
our moral obligation is to the american workers, and we're committed to helping them climb that great ladder of success
to equip them with the skills they need, we launched the pledge to america's workers
three hundred and sixty-seven private sector partners are providing more than 14 million skills and career-training opportunities for u
workers
and i have to say, i'm very proud of her
my daughter ivanka, that's all she wants to talk about
i say, ivanka, can we please talk about something else
no, dad
i met today with walmart
they're taking a million people
i met… she is   she wants to make these people have great lives
and when she started this two and a half years ago, her goal was 500,000 jobs
she's now created 14 million jobs and they're being trained by these great companies   the greatest companies in the world
because the government can't train them
it's a great thing
so, jared is here and you'll thank   you'll thank ivanka
she's done an amazing job
fourteen million from 500,000
we're at 14 million and going up
today, the world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and proud and prosperous america
the world is a better place because of it also
but everything that we have achieved is under threat from the left-wing ideology that demands absolute conformity, relentless regulation, and a top-down control of the entire u
s economy
far-left politicians in our nation's capitol want a massive government takeover of healthcare
they want to give government bureaucrats domination over every aspect of your business and your life
they want to eliminate american oil and natural gas
they want to enlist us in global projects designed to redistribute american wealth and kill american jobs all over our nation
washington's democrats and their radical agenda of socialism would demolish our economy, reinstate the avalanche of regulations that i have already ended, decimate the middle class, and totally bankrupt our nation
as long as i'm president, america will never be a socialist country
we are reawakening the majestic spirit of enterprise and exploration, discovery, and all of the other things that we need to create that exceptional character that our nation is developing now more than at any time in the past
we're a nation of unbridled pioneers, and adventurers, and risk-takers
we inherit the legacy of courageous, free, and independent souls who ventured across oceans, braved the wilderness, settled the frontiers, tamed the wild west, and raised up towering cities of concrete, iron, and steel
our american ancestors produced miracles of science, lost   this is    lost so many lives, but launched revolutions in technology, created groundbreaking new industries, built the railroads that linked our cities, fashioned the skyscrapers that touched the clouds, and gave us the most prosperous nation to ever exist on the face of the earth
this is our american heritage
this is who we are
this is who we will forever be
we believe in the dignity of work and the nobility of each and every american worker
we believe the future is forged in the mind of the american inventor, the soul of the american craftsman, the heart of the american entrepreneur, and the faith of the american investor
we know that there is nothing we cannot achieve as one team, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under god
with everyone here today, and millions of patriots across our land, we are making america stronger, prouder, and greater than ever before
and, ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come
thank you
god bless you
and god bless america
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much
good
thank you, john
they haven't been hurt
you know, they were totally down
now they are a little bit down because a little big, perhaps, the uncertainty of trade wars
but there is no uncertainty
we're the bank that everyone wants to take from
we're the source that everybody needs and everybody wants all over the world
the real cost, john, would be if we did nothing
the cost of doing nothing was killing us, as a country   our national debt and so many other things
but it was killing us
so when i   when you say, gee, let's just…   because perhaps this is an assumption based on the question   gee, let's just keep it the way it is with china, that would be the real cost
we can't do that
one of the things i was able to do with china
as an example   we've taken in   i mean, we'll soon be up to $100 billion in tariffs
and you haven't seen inflation and you haven't seen, in many cases, price increases
our farmers   because i have a very good relationship with our farmers   our great american farmers   i call them patriots   they were hurt very badly by china because china targeted them because they were my vote
the whole middle of the country   it's a beautiful thing to see, i will say
but they targeted them
and i said to sonny perdue, our secretary of agriculture, sonny, how much is it
and he said, the year before last, it was $12 billion, and this year it's $16 billion in orders
i said, that's okay, sonny
we're going to give them $28 billion
we're going to take it right out of the tariffs
and, hopefully, the farmers will say, thank you very much, china
and we spread   distributed, two years, $28 billion around to china   around from china, into our farmers and farms and ranchers and all of the people that were targeted
so, i would say, in a rough manner, by china
i would say in a very rough manner
and now china is coming back
and as you know, they're already starting big buys   very big buys
and the farmers are very happy
the incredible thing with the farmers is they don't want a subsidy, they don't want a handout
but in this case, i thought it was something that i wanted to do, and i was able to do it   $28 billion
and after that, we had tremendous amounts of the billions left over that we could use
actually, we could use it for tax reductions
we could distribute it to people
and again, if we don't make a deal with china   look, i had a deal
we had a deal
this gentleman can tell you, we were so close to a deal
the hard points were negotiated
opening up china, intellectual property, all sorts of tremendous penalties
and then, one day, we get a call   seven months ago, we get a call, they'd like to see us
and we saw them, and they explained why they can't do three or four things that were already agreed to
and i said, okay
thank you very much
thank you
thank you
what a group
wow
thank you
well, i want to thank you all, and it's a big crowd of people outside
we couldn't get them in
we'll do a bigger room the next time, but we want to thank you very much
and i want to thank a special friend of mine, ben carson, for the introduction for   and for doing so much and such a great job at hud, and vice president mike pence, always been there, always been there
he's great, great gentleman, great man
and i'm thrilled to be here in the heart of georgia to launch our incredible new nationwide grassroots effort, blacks   think of this, blacks for trump, black voices for trump, african-americans for trump
call it whatever the hell you want, correct
we like it
what do you prefer, blacks for trump or african-americans for trump
i think so
great
well, i want to thank you
and i'll tell you what, we're doing well
we have our best employment numbers and we're going to get into it, but the support we're getting from the african-american community has been overwhelming, and i want to thank each and every one of you for your courage and tenacity and devotion to really what's turning out to be a movement
this was like a movement in 2016
there was a movement of a lot of people
and by the way, you made up a good portion of that movement
you know that
diamond and silk, you're so  so great
and i hear you're knocking them dead
you're all over the place
that's good
it's the way it's supposed to work, right
someday you'll have to save a ticket for me
i'll walk in with the first lady and we'll be happy
good
susan, when you're in washington, i want   i want you to let me know
great job you're doing
i really appreciate it
with your help, we're going to travel all across the country to every community, urban, rural, and suburban, and we're going to campaign for every last african-american vote in 2020
from the beginning of our campaign, we took on the washington lobbyists and the special interests and corporate media
see how that's working
they come at you, but you know what, we're winning   we're winning like nobody's ever won before
we took on the corrupt media, a lot of it is corrupt, and the political establishment that has failed america for decades and failed the african-american community for decades
and we're starting to learn about things that we never thought were possible even
exactly three years ago tonight, on november 8, 2016, the people spoke and we took our country back, and that's what's happening
we won an extraordinary victory for all americans, and one year from now, we're going to win another incredible victory and we are going to do it with a groundswell of support from hardworking african-american patriots
and you know exactly what i'm talking about, because, all together, we've never done better   we've never done better than we're doing now
the republican party was the original home of african-americans
and now, african-americans are returning
it was a hundred year trip if you think about it
paris, it was 100 years, right
and now, you're returning and coming back to the republican party
people forget, abraham lincoln was a republican
we have to remember that
and you're coming back in record numbers
we're going to make 2020 a chance
we're going to give it really something
we're going to make it a chance that you take, but it's not a chance, because you know exactly what's happening
you've seen
you know, when i first came out and started talking about vote for me, that was taking a chance because i wasn't a politician
now, everything i said has come true, except more so   more so   much more than we ever thought possible when we look at the numbers, and we're going to go into the numbers
we're going to make 2020 a year of change in black communities all across the country
we've already been doing it
and black americans will join our mission to protect their jobs, defend their safety, and to create a brighter future for every citizen
together, we will make america greater than ever before, and that's what's happening right now and you're big part of what's going on
we're delighted to be joined by harrison floyd of our black voices coalition

lieutenant governor geoff duncan, former terrific baseball player, by the way, for those of you that don't know
right, geoff
your georgia attorney general, chris carr
chris has done a real job
thank you, chris
thanks, chris
great job
and the attorney general-elect of kentucky is here
he's become a big star
i don't know
i don't know
we had a great kentucky, but we got no credit for it
you know, we   we had a man running for governor who really worked hard, really worked hard, but he was down a lot and almost won, and maybe will
i think he's contesting it
is that right
i think he's contesting it
but we brought him up 19 points
and then the media said, that was a bad night for trump
but we also won five of six of the races, and the first african-american attorney general in kentucky's history
he   this is going to be a star
let's see if i'm right about it
i predicted you
i predicted you
daniel cameron
daniel, you're there someplace
great job, daniel
so proud of you
wow, he won by a lot
he won by a lot
that was a lot of fun we had
we were there the night before and it was   it was some evening
that was some evening
but that was a tremendous record
you   you set a record, as you know, for what you were running for
it's been a long time too
when i ran for office three years ago, i looked at the bleak, dismal record of the democrat party and asked the african-american community, what the hell do you have to lose
right
what do you have to lose
and i came off stage at night and all these professional handlers, right
i don't have too many handlers, but they say, sir, i don't think they're going to like that
i said, no, look, because i read a list, last in crime, last in this, last in home ownership, last in the economy, lowest wages
all of this stuff
and i said, wait a minute
i'm just reading off a list
and i said, wait a minute
and that's when i said it, it wasn't this part of the script
i do my best work off script
my best work
i hate to say this
i also do my worst work off script
so you never get in trouble when you go by the script
right, paris
no, i do my best and my worst work, and it makes things very exciting too
but that was my best work
i mean, it was a very important statement to be made because, honestly, the democrats have let you down
and then i made you a solemn pledge that, whether you voted for me or not, i would be your greatest champion
and you did, you came out, we did very well
i think we do a lot better this time, because now you know that we do it
now, it's not just talk
don't forget, i came not as a politician, i came as a business man and i said we're going to do things that are going to be great
businessman slash television star, all right
we had a lot of fun with the apprentice
but i said we're going to do a job
and so   but who knew
i mean, a lot of people, they didn't know, would i pick good judges
they didn't know a lot of things
they see what we've done with judges
we picked   we're at 157 federal and court of appeal judges
we'll be at 182 soon, a record
it's a record
and we were left by the previous administration 142 judges to fill
can you imagine that
that's   i thought they may have one
they may have none
i said, how many
sir, you have 142
i said, you have to be kidding
you have to be kidding
142
so we'll be at 182, two great supreme court judges, and so it's great
two great justices of the supreme court and we're going to be looking at that whole situation with judges because we have a lot coming due and it's   you know, there is some saying, greatest thing you can do, greatest legacy, most important thing to do for a president
i say military and defense is always most important somehow
i would say defense
we've totally rebuilt our military
our military is strong
we did a pretty big number on al-baghdadi last week
pretty big number
he didn't know what the hell hit him, i can tell you that
they came in
they weren't playing games
they weren't playing games
they came in on those brand new, those beautiful choppers, and they said   they went through the war
they didn't go through the door, you know
i said, why are they    because i'm watching this like you watch a movie
ok, like you watch a movie
and they came through that, they , that was dynamite
, they blew a hole
i said, why don't they just walk through the front door
it's called booby traps
i said that makes sense
but you never saw anything go so quickly, and so it was violent, but it was incredible
that was incredible
he killed a lot of people
he was the founder of isis, and isis was bad
and when you saw those people in the orange outfits and the horrible things that happened to those people in the orange outfits, this is the man and we   we took him out, and then we took out his second
and we've got our eye on his third
and i vowed to pour out all of my heart and soul to fight for your families and for your future
that was after   it's true
i was reading that list, that horrible list
it was 10 points
and everyone was the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst for african-american, and every single one was the worst
they had statistics, and i'm saying, you know, ben, this is really bad
and we took care of it
now   now you have from the worst to the best numbers you've had
for decades, the democrats have taken african-american voters totally for granted
they have
they didn't do anything for you
democrats have run america's inner cities at every level of government for 50, 60, and 70 years and really a hundred years
i view it
i think, paris, right, 100 years
when detroit last had a republican mayor in 1962, it had a strong, beautiful economy, per capita incomes were among the highest in the nation
and after nearly 60 years of really crooked democrat rule, it's one of the poorest cities in america
it was one of the most successful cities in america
philadelphia has a poverty rate more than double the national average
the city has had a democrat mayor every year since 1952
20 out of 20 most dangerous cities in america last year were run by democrats
i'd say that's not too good
nationwide, 58% of murder victims under the age of 22 are african-american
america is waking up to the democrat party's record of suffering and neglect
that's what it is
they want your vote
they're nice to you just before the election, and then they forget about you for four years or two years or six years or whatever it may be
then they come and they hit you hard for three months and then they get your vote and they say bye, bye
no, i see it
i mean, i deal with them all the time
i deal with the crooked politician
this guy, adam schiff, he's a   no, he's a    he's a crooked politician
nancy pelosi should go back home to san francisco and clean up her district
it's falling apart with drugs and with homeless, and with all of the problems
it's not the same san francisco
of all   california is a mess, it's right
of all of the washington sellouts that have wounded our nation, none has been worse hit than the democrat party's cruel and betrayal
i mean, you   the betrayal of the black community is unbelievable what's happened
it's unbelievable
democrats bowed at the feet of special interests and trapped your children in failing government schools
you look at the schools, worst schools
and we're making a lot of progress, but you have the worst schools of anybody in the country by   by far
it's not even close
they shipped your jobs overseas with catastrophic and horrible trade deals which was changing around rapidly
we have to see what happens with us
we can't get nancy pelosi to approve usmca
that's between canada, the united states
it's a phenomenal deal for us
democrats threw open america's borders to the deadly drugs and ruthless gangs that are all over the place, to mass illegal immigration, which hurts the black community so badly
they pass crime bills that devastated your communities
and democrats waged a relentless assault on the cherished values that have always defined african-american families
you know that
it's   it's amazing that you've stayed so long, to be honest
it almost becomes a habit, right
it's a habit
like it's   we vote for a democrat
nobody knows why they vote for a democrat
look, if they don't do the job, you switch
you've got to switch and some progress has been made like never before, perhaps, in such a short period of time
but under this administration, all of that has changed and it's changing even faster now
we're undoing the damage inflicted by decades of corrupt democrat rule and creating a historic tide of new opportunity and prosperity
we've done more for african-americans in three years than the broken washington establishment has done in more than 30 years
we've created 6
7 million new jobs since the election, a number that if i would have said that to the fake news media back there, look at all those cameras
if i would have said that   now, if i would have said that during the campaign, i would have been excoriated
they would have gone wild
how dare he make 6
7 million new jobs, take at that, since the election
last month, the african-american unemployment rate reached the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country
how do you lose that argument in a debate, right
the african-american youth unemployment, this was so important to me
you remember how high, it was 60, 70%, has now reached the lowest number ever recorded in the history of our country
doing really well
the african-american poverty rate has reached an all time historic low, lowest it's ever been
for the first time ever, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women
first time that's ever happened
wages are rising really fast, up 9% since the election
a number that was unthinkable
and they're rising fastest for low income workers
proportionately, they're rising the fastest for the low income worker
who would have thought this was going to happen
almost 2
5 million americans have been lifted out of poverty since my election, including 150,000 african-american children
150,000, it's a lot
see, when i hear 150,000, a lot of people don't know what that means
you know what it means to me
we fill up yankee stadium three times, three
that's a lot of people
to bring investment to neglected communities, we've cut a record number of job destroying regulations more than any administration in history, even though we've been here for a short while by comparison
we passed massive tax cuts for working families, saving the typical family of four $2,000 a year
and over the last two years, my administration has also provided more than eight billion dollars in contracts and financing to minority owned small businesses, which alone has resulted in a minimum of 20,000 brand new beautiful jobs
so with us today are kelvin and janelle king from right here in atlanta
kelvin is a graduate of the united states air force academy, great place, where he was also all conference football player
today, kelvin and his wife, janelle, own a general contracting business and they're doing really well
kelvin and janelle, please come up, say a few words, please
come on up
he looks so happy
he should be happy
hi, thank you
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much
please
all you
that's right
appreciate it
do you want to say something
very good job, man
smart
thank you very much
that's beautiful
that's really beautiful
thank you very much
congratulations
every day, we're reversing ruinous trade policies that have shattered black middle class citizens
after the twin disasters of nafta and china's entrance into the world trade organization, which was a horrible thing for us, one in four manufacturing jobs held by african-americans were totally gone
they were extinguished
in the last three decades, milwaukee lost 27% of all manufacturing jobs
cleveland lost 42%
dayton lost 44%
philadelphia lost 74%
but under this administration, the days of shipping american jobs and wealth to foreign countries, it's over
it's ended
they're coming back here
they're all coming back
it's happening, you see it
10,000 plants are being opened in the united states or have been since we   since we took over
60,000 have been lost prior to that
think of that
60,000
on behalf of african-americans and all americans
we're now putting america first
it's a really good thing
we've had it
in other words, we've had it, right
we're standing up to the decades of chronic chinese trading abuses and replacing the nafta catastrophe with the brand new usmca, a giant victory for the farmers and ranchers and manufacturers from coast to coast
the do nothing democrats, which is what they are
i've come up with that name
i don't think they like it too much, but who cares
they're do nothings
all they do is waste their time, instead of doing things that they could
they just go and let's impeach him
we can't beat him
how about the guy
we can't beat him, so let's impeach him
did you see that one
he was a beauty
we can't beat him
let's impeach him
good idea
the do nothing democrats are blocking a vote on the usmca
nancy pelosi, she's blocking the vote
she doesn't want the vote to take place because they would rather hurt their political opponents than help their black constituents
that's what it is
under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories in just three years and we're just getting started
tremendous numbers are coming in
everybody wants to be in the usa
you know, we're the   we're the hot place, we're the hottest economy by far anywhere in the world
to keep jobs in america, i withdrew the united states from the disastrous job killing paris climate accord
the only one upset about it in the whole country was paris dennard
i mean, even you like it, paris, right
ok, he said he like it
good
democrats want to invest in green global projects
i want to invest in black american communities
it's true
so true
thank you
thank you
thank you very much
16, take it   let's go to 16 more years of   and they all go back, see, i told you
he wants to be a dictator
these people are crazy
to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, we created 9,000 opportunity zones
tim scott of south carolina was incredible in that
including 26 right here in atlanta
eight million african-americans live in opportunity zones, yet every democrat voted against giving these black citizens the future they deserve
the republicans got it passed, not easy
we had no votes from democrats
and now the democrats are saying we made a big mistake, but they're never going to admit that publicly
i can guarantee you
but they were totally against it
but we had tremendous help
i said tim scott was so incredible
your senators were incredible, david and johnny
and it's been incredible
nobody ever thought that could happen to the extent it's happened
it is revitalized areas and created jobs like nobody thought would be possible
to draw investment to these impoverished communities, we slashed the capital gains tax in opportunity zones to zero because people are coming in with very, you know, what would have been high risk money and now they're coming in and they're thrilled and they're coming in with more and more
money is now pouring into and property values have skyrocket
it's coming into the communities
and values are up 20%, 25, 30%
today, we're glad to be joined by paul morrow, a proud army veteran, great person, and a small business owner in selma, alabama
he's building a new concrete plant in an opportunity zone in montgomery to help support the future home of the brand new f-35 fighter jets, and i'll be in alabama tomorrow, watching a football game
that'll be a good game
that would be a good game, i think
so what happened to georgia
they're not in the game, but your team is doing well, right
doing well
but we'll be there tomorrow
hey, paul, come on up, say a few words, please
thank you
thank you
great job
wow
thank you, paul
what a job
i think he enjoyed that too, right
he's doing so well in the concrete business, i don't think he wants to be a politician
you want to be a politician
i don't think so
what a great job
thank you very much, and that's from the heart too, by the way
after my election, i heard from countless african-american leaders
they asked me to get involved in a cause that is dear to many of them
in this room, right now, i see so many of you that are   it was so important to you
that's criminal justice reform
and last year, with the help of jared, where is jared
he's right here
stand up, jared
jared was incredible
i proudly signed bipartisan criminal justice reform into law
they'd been trying to do it for many, many, many years
they never came close, including the last administration
i don't know if they tried, actually, but they did try, they didn't   they didn't try even, and that's   you know why they didn't try
because they knew they weren't going to get it
that's probably big reason why
but it's called the first step act, roll back the unjust provisions of the 1994 clinton crime law, which was so unfair to your community, which severely and disproportionately harmed african-american people
we're also advancing second chance hiring to get rehabilitated citizens with a criminal record back to the job
one of the things we have going for is so good, is the economy is so good that we're giving chances today that, frankly, years ago, you wouldn't have, and people are so happy
employers, people that pay the check every week, they're so happy with the result
they can't believe that they looked at it as an opportunity, where has this been for 30 years
why haven't we been doing this for so long
when we say hire american, we mean hire all americans, that's what we mean
but we're also restoring safety to america's great cities
in the two years before my election, murders were up by more than 20% nationwide
in the last two years, murders in america's major cities have dropped by more than 10%
and to protect the cherished role of historically black colleges and universities, we increased federal funding for hbc use by over $100 million
they do a great job, they do a great job and some needed some help, frankly, but they do a great job
we can't lose them
but as we're delivering results for african-americans, the hard left democrats have been busy doing absolutely nothing for you
for over three straight years, they've been obsessed with one single delusional goal, overturning the votes of the 2016 great election that we had
and really, if you think about it, overturning american democracy
first, it was the russia hoax
then it was the mueller report
the biggest lie ever perpetrated upon the american people, russia
give me a break
well, i   you know, i felt a little bit better because i see two weeks ago, right
hillary clinton said that jill stein, a greenie, she was a greenie
it's ok
the head of the green party, right
ran against hillary
right, paris
and that tulsi gabbard
i don't know tulsi gabbard, but she said that they're russian operatives, that they're involved with russia
now, i don't know either of these women, but i know they're not involved with russia
when they said it about me, it took me two years to get out of it
it took them two minutes
people said, we think she's nuts at this point
now, democrats in the media have launched, and they are partners, you know that
the deranged hyper partisan impeachment witch hunt, a sinister effort to nullify the ballots of 63 million patriotic americans
it's not happening by the way
that's failing   it's failing fast
it's all a hoax
it's all a hoax, it's failing fast
democrats are willing to destroy the foundations of our society and the pillars of our justice system and judicial system in their craven pursuit of power and money
imagine if democrats just put 10% of the energy they devote to attacking me and my administration to instead making this a better country for african-american citizens
can you imagine what they could do
they don't care, but we do, ok
that's really the truth, and i think you're learning that quickly, we're all learning that
with republicans in congress, we're fighting for school choice
we believe that in america, no parent should ever be forced to send their child out the door to a failing government school
it shouldn't happen   shouldn't happen
today's democrat party has no ideas about how to help black americans
they only want to really use radical socialism and they want to open your borders, so anybody can come in, you're here
anybody can come in
and they have some bad people wanting to come in, really bad people
we've really strengthened up the borders, as you know, and if we had some help from them, we need some votes to get rid of loopholes
they have loopholes
they call loopholes
democrats want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens, courtesy of you, the american taxpayer and the african-american community
republicans believe that public benefits should be protected for american citizens
for the money that we spend on illegal aliens, we could completely rebuild our inner cities, repair our crumbling infrastructure, and fix our terrible public schools
schools that are in terrible shape
but instead, democrats want to redistribute your wealth all over the entire world to places that you've never even heard of before
every day, democrat sanctuary cities are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and gang members like ms-13 onto your streets
republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding americans, not criminal aliens
last year, democrats even shut down the government to preserve benefits for illegal immigrants
never have they fought that hard to do anything for the african-american community
they don't fight that way
i see them, i'm with them
they don't fight for the african-american community
they would rather have illegal aliens come in, healthcare, schools
i jokingly said once, rolls-royces, every illegal immigrant gets a rolls-royce, and the media said, donald trump exaggerated
he said they all get rolls-royces
this is a lie
these people are the worst
no, no, they don't give them rolls-royces, just shorter for rolls
they gave them just short of the rolls-royce, right
democrats care more about illegal aliens than african-american citizens or our military or citizens all over the place
they care more
under democrat politicians, african-americans become and they have become   really, they've   they've become forgotten, literally forgotten americans
but under my administration, you've seen what we've been able to do, because they are forgotten no longer, right
radical democrats are waging an all out assault on the historic values and traditions of the black community
they are trying to attack law enforcement heroes and keep us sa   these are people that keep us safe
there's nothing wrong with that
we want safety
because when i read that list of 10, one of the things is it's the most unsafe
the african-american community is so   is so   the numbers are different, like you wouldn't believe
we want to be safe
they want to take away your right to self-defense, crush your religious liberty, and silence your pastors
pastors are being silenced, but not any longer because of the johnson amendment   the johnson amendment
they're allowed to speak to you now
they're allowed   your pastors and your ministers are allowed to speak to you now without retribution
african-american churches have always been lifted up and they've always been really the conscience of our nation
yet democrats now want to drive faith out of the public square and attack christians and other religious believers
that's what they're doing
they have gone crazy, ok
they really are
it's   what's going on out there is crazy
as your president, i will always cherish our nation's religious heritage
we will always cherish that
it means so much
you know, when you look at things that are happening, a lot of it is because they've lost that incredible grounding, especially the vital and indispensable role of african-american churches in our society, incredible
we have some ministers here and some pastors here
you heard from one, he's an incredible man
but we have some ministers, pastors, and others that are people that we all look up to and their voice has to be heard
they have to be heard
they've tried   they're trying to take that voice away, it won't happen
don't worry, it won't happen
so don't worry too much about it
don't lose any sleep tonight, ok
virtually, every top democrat who also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth
and then you have the governor of virginia where it was after birth
after birth, that's evil
that's why i've asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from god
to every african-american across our land, you don't have to choose to leave the democrat party because the democrat party already left you a long time ago
it's true
they left you
well, they come back before elections for a few months, but that's about it
if you don't want to have radical socialism, that's what you don't want, if you don't want open borders, if you don't want out of control political correctness
how about some of this political correctness, right
if you don't want your jobs going overseas, if you don't want your children trapped in failing schools, if you don't want liberal extremists to run your lives, then today we say, welcome to the republican party
it's true
honest abe, right
honest abe
now and always, republicans are the party of lincoln and frederick douglass, the civil rights act, and hardworking american patriots of every race, religion, color, and creed
the republican party knows that our rights, liberties, and freedoms are given to us by the hand of almighty god
guided by that immortal truth, republicans are fighting for incredible jobs, great schools, safe streets, fair laws, and a government that listens and answers to you, the american people
when we talk about draining the swamp, we are talking about replacing the corrupt bureaucrats and politicians, crony lobbyists, brought and paid for, and you know that, they bring them in and they pay for them
and unfortunately, if you look at the countries, they have not done their job
unfortunately, they have not done their job
guatemala, honduras, el salvador   they're paid a lot of money
every year, we give them foreign aid
and they did nothing for us
nothing
they did nothing for us
so we give them tremendous amounts of money
you know what it is
you cover it all the time
hundreds of millions of dollars
they, like a lot of others, do nothing for our country
i have
i spoke to the crown prince
we have people over in saudi arabia now
we have top intelligence people in turkey
and we're going to see what we have
i'll know a lot tomorrow
they'll be coming back either tonight or tomorrow morning
but we have people in saudi arabia and people in turkey
i think that's a long time
you said they want a month
that's a long time
there's no reason for that much
be faster
we're looking at it
we have a lot of different concepts right now
they have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now
you know that as well as i do
and we're looking at it very seriously
i'm protecting everybody
you know what i'm doing
i'm protecting everybody
i want to protect our country
oh, i think he has
i think it's going to be
i think they wanted to see that i'm on his side, and i am, 100 percent
we have   i mean, you people have been reporting   over 100,000 people
they lined up two days ago, and it's very exciting
oh, i think ted will be a big factor tonight
he's going to get up
he's going to make a great speech
i'm going to get up
i'm going to make a great speech
i hope   are most of you going
you're not going
i can't believe it
you're not going to be there tonight
that's terrible
i think beto o'rourke is highly overrated
when i heard about him, i figured he must be something a little special
he's not
i thought he got beaten badly in the debates
i think he's a highly overrated guy
say it
oh, i have, yeah
ted and i get along very well, very late into the campaign
and i said, don't worry about it
it's only a question of time
and then it became very nasty, and then it was over
and when it was over, we've gotten along great
no, i like ted
if you remember, he was the last one that we really had   i mean, i went very late into the campaign
we actually held a rally together late into the campaign
i said, it will end   and it did   and then it got back
no, we've very close
we've done great on tax cuts
we've done great on regulation cuts
no, he's been really terrific
and if you look at what's happening in germany, with respect to the pipeline, they want to now start buying our natural gas
it just came out
so take a look at that
to me, he's not lyin' ted anymore
he's beautiful ted
he's texas   i call him texas ted
no, ted cruz and i had a very, very nasty and tough campaign
it was a very competitive   it was a very tough campaign
once it ended and we got together   and, by the way, very late into the campaign we lasted
people were shocked
i said, don't worry, it's only a question of time
and then ultimately, what happened, we fought it out
the outcome was obvious
and we have worked together very closely
i like him a lot
i actually like him a lot
and he's a very smart guy
he loves the people of texas   which i do
and, in fact, right now, i guess they said they've never seen it
it's like a big tailgate
it goes on for miles
it's over 100,000 people
i think nellie ohr is a disgrace, and i think her husband is not much better
maybe he's worse
i think nellie ohr is a disgrace, taking marital protection so she doesn't have to talk about corruption
i think she's a disgrace
hey, look, i can't tell you
i can only tell you this
we give them hundreds of millions of dollars
they do nothing for us
you know what
maybe it will and maybe it won't
but it certainly hasn't affected
they can do a lot better job
if you look at the three countries in particular   and i don't know what's going on with mexico
i guess it looks like the people are walking right through the middle of mexico, so i'm not exactly thrilled there either
you know what, jon, i'm going to know very shortly, because i have a great group people in turkey right now and a great group of people in saudi arabia
we will know very soon
we have tremendously talented people that do this stuff very well
they're coming back tonight, tomorrow
and i will know very soon
and i am not satisfied with what i've heard
look, rand has some ideas
i agree with rand on a lot of things
i don't want to lose all of that investment that's being made in our country
i don't want to lose a million jobs
i don't want to lose a $110 billion in terms of investment
but it's really $450 billion if you include other than military
so that's very important
but we're going to get to the bottom of it
yeah
i'm really looking to make america great again
that's what i do
i'm making america great again
we have been giving so much money to so many different countries for so long, and it's not fair and it's not good
and then we ask them to keep their people in their country, they're unable to do it
it's called make america great again
no, we're going to be passing   no, no
we're putting in a resolution sometime in the next week, or week and a half, two weeks
we're going to put in   we're giving a middle-income tax reduction of about 10 percent
we're doing it now for middle-income people
this is not for business
this is for middle
that's on top of the tax decrease that we've already given them
i'm going through congress
we won't have time to do the vote
we'll do the vote later
we'll do the vote after the election
i think their tremendous spirt, maybe like i've never seen, other than in 16'
you don't remember 16'
you're too young
i have never seen spirit like the spirit that we have right now, except the week before the race   the presidential race, two years ago
i think the republicans are going to do very nicely
we're doing very well with the senate
he was just asking about the race
other than two years ago   the presidential race   i have never seen spirit like i see right now
i think the republicans are going to do very well
people are tired of high taxes
we gave the tax cuts
we've done so much
and they want a strong military
they want protection
they want safety
they want security
we give that
the democrats do not give that
the democrats don't know what they're doing
they don't know what they're giving
i think we're going to do very, very well in the race
yeah
i don't regret anything, honestly
it all worked out very nicely
you shouldn't have   take a look
they want to get out of sanctuary cities
many places in california want to get out of sanctuary cities
yeah, it is rioting in some cases
who's an activist
who
well, i'm going to have to find out
we're going to find out a lot
we're going to find out
we're going to know a lot over the next two days about the saudi situation
it's a very sad thing
any more
you know what you should do, jon
go into the middle of the caravan, take your cameras, and search
okay
search
no, no
take your   jon, take your camera, go into the middle, and search
you're going to find ms-13, you're going to find middle eastern, you're going to find everything
and guess what
we're not allowing them in our country
we want safety
we want safety
well, i think it's going to happen
i'm not saying
but i think we're doing really well
i have never seen such spirit, except for maybe '16,  the big election
i have never seen the spirit that we have right now
i think the republicans are going to do very well
i have never spirit like we have
now, whether it's kavanaugh, whether it's tax cuts that we gave, whether it's common sense   i've never seen it
but i'll tell you   i'll tell you a big factor is what's happening on the border
what's happening on the border was caused by the democrats because they won't let anybody change immigration laws that are horrible
the worst anywhere in the world
no, they didn't
no, they didn't
not at all
that's all fiction
we're going to see what happens
and i'm going to know a lot in two days
i'll see you in texas
see you in texas
until people come to their senses, we will build it up
until people come to their senses
russia has not adhered to the agreement
this should've been done years ago
until people come to their senses   we have more money than anybody else, by far
we'll build it up
until they come to their senses
when they do, then we'll all be smart and we'll all stop
and we'll   and by the way, not only stop, we'll reduce, which i would love to do
but right now, they have not adhered to the agreement
it's a threat to whoever you want
and it includes china, and it includes russia, and it includes anybody else that wants to play that game
you can't do that
you can't play that game on me
until people get smart
until they get smart
they have not adhered to the spirit of that agreement, or to the agreement itself   russia
china is not included in the agreement
they should be included in the agreement
until they get smart, there will be nobody that's going to be even close to us
no, i have not
i have not
i don't have to speak to him
i don't have to speak
i'm terminating the agreement because they violated the agreement
i'm terminating the agreement
thanks everybody
thank you
thank you
thank you very much
please sit down
it's really great to see everybody on this beautiful, beautiful day in washington, d
some people say the swamp, but i will not say that today
i refuse
this is too important, what we're doing
one of the most important deals, and the most important trade deal we've ever made by far
i want to thank senator joni ernst for being here   joni, thank you very much   of iowa, and i'll be there very soon
we'll be doing something very important in iowa
but this is maybe more important than all of it put together
right, joni
so i want to thank you for being here
congressman holding, congressman roe, congressman newhouse, and congressman meadows, thank you all for being here
we very much appreciate it
you've been very instrumental
thank you
i am thrilled to speak to the american people to share truly historic news for our nation, and, indeed for the world
i want to thank vice president pence for joining us this morning
it is my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace nafta and the nafta trade agreements with an incredible new us-mexico-canada agreement, called usmca
it, sort of, just works
usmca
usmca
that'll be the name, i guess, that, 99 percent of the time, we'll be hearing
usmca
it has a good ring to it
i have long contended that nafta was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made
since nafta's adoption, the united states racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion   and it's a much higher number than that   with canada and mexico
it lost vast amounts of money, and lost 4
1 million manufacturing jobs, and 1 in 4 auto jobs
lost about 25 percent of our auto jobs   even more than that
throughout the campaign, i promised to renegotiate nafta, and today we have kept that promise
but, for 25 years, as a civilian, as a businessman, i used to say, how could anybody have signed a deal like nafta
and i watched new england, and so many other places where i was just   the factories were leaving, the jobs were leaving, people were being fired, and we can't have that
so we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity
to me, it's the most important word in trade because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world
and we're changing that
we just signed a much better deal with south korea
we had a horrible, horrible deal, and we just signed that at united nations
and that's worked out well
and they're happy
we're happy
it's good for jobs
good for a lot of things
when that deal was signed, they said 250,000 jobs will be given be   by signing this transaction, and they were right
i've said it before
they were right
250,000 jobs to south korea, not to the united states
so that's changed and very much for the better
and this one is a brand new deal
the agreement will govern nearly $1
2 trillion in trade, which makes it the biggest trade deal in the united states' history
i want to congratulate u
trade representative bob lighthizer who has worked   nobody understands how hard he's worked
no matter when you called him, he was in the office or he was in somebody else's office doing the same thing
bob lighthizer is great
i've heard it for years
i said, if i ever do this, i want to get lighthizer to represent us, because he felt the way i did
and the entire team at the ustr, standing behind me, and some right here in the audience
i want to thank you all
fantastic job
peter navarro, everybody
thank you all
thank you
fantastic group of people
they love our country
i also want to thank you secretary mnuchin, secretary ross, secretary nielsen, secretary perdue, jared kushner, peter navarro, and united states ambassador to canada, kelly craft
thank you
thank you, kelly
thank you
i also want to thank president peña nieto of mexico, who   we had a few disagreements, but i really like him a lot
i think he may like me, i'm not sure
but i think he's a terrific person
and he'll be leaving soon, but he's really done a good job and   a wonderful, wonderful person
and the mexican president-elect lópez obrador, who has given his support to this agreement, and we're developing a really good relationship which i think is very important for our country, frankly, and for mexico
and so they worked together on this
this was done by both
i said, look, i don't want to sign an agreement, and then a new president comes in, they don't like it, and we have difficulty
they worked very much together on it, and i appreciate it from both
i have to, certainly, give my highest regards to prime minister of canada, justin trudeau
a lot of stories came out about justin and i having difficulty together, and we did over the trade deal
but i'll tell you, it's turned out to be a very, very good deal for both
and a very, very good deal for all three
it puts us in a position that we've never been in before
it's very good when you look at the world and what the world is doing and what   when you look at the unfair trade practices that countries are using against the united states, this is a terrific deal for all of us
once approved by congress, this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date, and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country, with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed
if you look at the reviews, people that would normally not, under any circumstances, say good things   because automatically they have to say bad
even some democrats say, that's amazing
we had some   they haven't been given the soundbites yet, i guess, mike
but actually, you had some democrats say, this is really amazing if he really got all of that
but by tomorrow, i would suspect they'll change their tune
but that's okay, because people know how good it is
it's an amazing deal for a lot of people
likewise, it will be the most advanced trade deal in the world with ambitious provisions on the digital economy
patents   very important
financial services
and other areas where the united states has a strong competitive advantage
mexico and canada have agreed to strong new labor protections, environmental protections, and new protections for intellectual property
so important
this new deal is an especially great victory for our farmers
our farmers have gone through a lot over the last 15 years
they've been taken advantage of by everybody
prices have gone way down
and we're working on some other deals that are going to make them very happy also
but this is a very, very big deal for our farmers
mexico and canada will be opened up a lot more than they are now
and i think there will be a better spirit between the three countries, which is important for our farmers
the agreement will give our farmers and ranchers far greater access to sell american-grown produce in mexico and in canada
the deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers' opportunities to export american wheat, poultry, eggs, and dairy   including milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream, to name a few
i want to be very specific
i want to be very specific, right
right
and many other products   but those products were not really being treated fairly, as far as those that work so hard to produce them
and now they're going to be treated fairly
these measures will support many hundreds of thousands of american jobs
this is also a historic win for american manufacturers and american autoworkers who have been treated so badly
we've lost so many jobs, over the years, under nafta
under the current new deal   and if you look at the current nafta deal, the new deal is taking care of all of these problems because nafta   foreign companies have been allowed to manufacture many of their parts overseas, ship them to mexico and canada for assembly, and send their foreign-made cars into the united states with no tax
so we let all our people go
we fire everybody
they make cars
they make products
they make everything in another country
they send them into the united states   no tax
and the cost is very little difference
sometimes it's more   for those people that like to talk about cost
with this agreement, we are closing all of these terrible loopholes
they're closed
they're gone
they were a disaster
for example, we are requiring a large portion of every car to be made by high-wage workers, which will greatly reduce foreign outsourcing   which was a tremendous problem
and means more auto parts and automobiles will be manufactured inside the united states
we will be manufacturing many more cars, and our companies won't be leaving the united states, firing their workers and building their cars elsewhere
there's no longer that incentive
before, under the nafta deal, they had that incentive
they have the opposite incentive
now, we're not going to be losing our companies
that was, to me, the most important thing
i don't want to see our companies leave and fire our workers, and our workers never get jobs to replace those jobs
those days are over
this deal will also impose new standards requiring at least 75 percent of every automobile to be made in north america in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets
and that's what it is, it's a privilege
we don't take it as a privilege
we don't take it as a privilege
it's a privilege for them to do business with us
and i'm not talking about mexico, canada   i'm talking about everybody
everybody
it's a privilege for china to do business with us
it's a privilege for the european union, who has treated us very badly   but that's coming along   to do business with us
japan, every country   it's a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank
in this, we will have a result of much more happening right here in the united states
it means, more than anything else, far more american jobs
and these are high-quality jobs
there are also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements
this will incentivize billions of dollars in new purchases of u
-made automobiles
once approved, this will be a new dawn for the american auto industry and for the american autoworker
they will see
they understand
they voted for us in large numbers, even though their leadership always goes democrat
a couple of them said to me, i don't know how i can do it again
many of them, the leaders would back democrats, and would tell me, you're going to get most of the votes from union workers
and we got most of the votes from workers, period
but the american autoworker was very much behind what we were doing
as one primary aspect, it will transform north america back into a manufacturing powerhouse
if you remember, the previous administration said, we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore, essentially
we're not going to have   we're not going to make things anymore
no, just the opposite
we're going to be a manufacturing powerhouse, and allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been offshored to the world because of unfair trade issues
we also provide brand new intellectual property protections for biologic drugs, which will make north america a haven for medical innovation and development
we want our drugs to be made here
when you talk prescription drugs, we don't like getting them from foreign countries
we don't know what's happening with those drugs, how they're being made
too important
this landmark agreement will send cash and jobs pouring into the united states and into north america   good for canada, good for mexico
instead of jobs leaving for overseas, they will be returning back home
and we've already had it
we have many, many car companies   i was with prime minister abe of japan
he said, we have sent many car companies to the united states over the last year and a half
it's true   and big expansions
and, very importantly, he said, many more are coming
because they have an incentive, now, to be here
people want to be back in the united states again
as i say, the united states is respected again
but it's also respected as to trade and industry
this is a truly extraordinary agreement for the united states, canada, and mexico
president peña nieto   it's so important that the president and i have developed this sort of a bond   a bond on trade
peña nieto, a man that has done a very good job for mexico, in terms of trade
and prime minister trudeau, who i just spoke to   just spoke to both of them a little while ago   they love their countries
they want to do right for their countries, and that's what they've done
and we've really formed   if you look at this agreement, we formed a great partnership with mexico and with canada
and i plan to sign the agreement by the end of november
i then will submit it for approval to congress where, in theory, there should be no trouble, but anything you submit to congress is trouble
no matter what
if it's the single greatest agreement ever signed, they'll say, well, you know, trump likes it, therefore we're not going to approve it because that would be good for the republicans
so therefore we can't approve it
but it will be sent to congress pursuant to the trade promotion authority act
this agreement follows on the heels of our successful completion of a new and balanced trade deal with south korea   a tremendous difference in that deal from what it was
it was a disaster, as i said   to improve the old deal that had killed so many jobs
it also follows on our announcement last week of a new trade negotiation with japan
japan would never negotiate with the united states
they would say, we're not going to negotiate
they told the previous administration, we're not going to negotiate
i said, you don't have to negotiate, but we're going to put a very, very substantial tax on your cars if you don't
by the way, without tariffs, we wouldn't be talking about a deal, just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs
that includes congress   oh, please don't charge tariffs
without tariffs, you wouldn't be   we wouldn't be standing here
i can tell you, bob and all of these folks would not be standing here right now
and we're totally prepared to do that if they don't negotiate
but japan is wanting to negotiate
actually, they called about three weeks ago
and he's a terrific man
a terrific   just had a tremendous victory
and they said, we'd like to start negotiations immediately
india, which is the tariff king   they called us, and they say, we want to start negotiations immediately
when bob lighthizer said, what happened
he would never do this
they said, no, we want to keep your president happy
isn't that nice
isn't that nice
it's true
they have to keep us happy because they understand that we're wise to what's been happening
india charges tariffs of 100 percent
and then, if we want to put a tariff of 25 percent on, people will call from congress
but that's not free trade
and i'd look back to people
i'd say, where do these people come from
where do they come from
so because of the power of tariffs and the power that we have with tariffs, we, in many cases, won't even have to use them
that's how powerful they are, and how good they are
but, in many cases, we're not going to have to use them
and, in many cases, countries that are charging massive tariffs are eliminating those tariffs
as you know, we have $250 billion at 25 percent interest with china right now, and we could go $267 billion more
and china wants to talk very badly
and i said, frankly, it's too early to talk
can't talk now, because they're not ready
because they've been ripping us for so many years
it doesn't happen that quickly
and if, politically, people force it too quickly, you're not going to make the right deal for our workers and for our country
but china wants to talk, and we want to talk to them
and we want them to help us with north korea
we want them to continue to help us with north korea
that's very important
the european union   it's been very tough on the united states
last year and for many years, they've lost in the vicinity of $150 billion a year
they have massive trade barriers
and they didn't want to come
they didn't want to talk
jean-claude   great businessperson, head of the european union   jean-claude, my friend   i'd say, jean-claude, we want to make a deal
he goes, no, no, no
we are very happy
i said, you may be happy, but i'm not happy
because we have one of the worst deals of any group
we have one of the worst deals with the european union
and they just didn't want to come because they were happy with the deal
i said, but we're not happy with the deal
and finally, after, you know, going through a whole process, i said, look, we're just going to put a tax of 20 percent on all of the millions of mercedes and bmws
all of the cars
there are millions and millions of cars that they sell here that they won't take over there
farm product that they won't take over there because they have barriers
you can't sell
you're not allowed to
our farmers aren't allowed to sell over there   many of their products, much of their products, most of them
and so i announced that we're going to put a 20 percent tariff   could be 25   on their cars coming in
and they immediately called, and said, we'd like to start negotiations
and we're having a successful negotiation
we'll see what happens
who knows
i always say, who knows
but we'll see
i have a feeling we'll be successful
a pillar of national security is economic security and trade
national security is not where we lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year
over the last five years, we've averaged $800 billion-a-year loss on trade
how dumb is that
eight hundred billion dollars
this group doesn't know about those numbers
i don't even want them to hear those numbers
but the united states, in its trade deals, has lost, on average, almost $800 billion a year
that's dealing with china, dealing with european union,    with everybody
japan, mexico, canada   everybody
and we're not going to allow that to happen
but we have to have a strong manufacturing base and manufacturing sector
we need a thriving economy
those are all, really, essential ingredients to national security
we can't allow what's been happening over the last 25 years to happen
we're building our military like never before
it will be the strongest it ever was
and all of those jets that are made, and rockets, and missiles, and ships   they're all being made in the united states
jobs
our economy is booming like never before
jobless claims are at a 50-year low
the stock market is at an all-time high
think of that   over 50 percent since my election
fifty percent
people   the 401 s, and they were dying with them for years
now they're so happy
i was telling the story i often tell of a policeman in new york
came up   his wife was always very upset with him as an investor because he wasn't doing well with the 401(k)s
now she thinks he's a genius because the numbers are so crazy
but we're up over 50 percent since the election
and you've heard me say this many times, but african american unemployment, asian unemployment, hispanic unemployment is at record lows in history   not, you know, for the last two years   the history of our country
african american, asian, hispanic, young people without high school diplomas   all at historic   that's a very important sector   all at historic lows
the lowest in history
it's really something that's great
this is helping so much with people that get out of prison
we have a tremendous problem
people come out of prison, they can't get a job
employers don't want to hire them
the economy is so good, they're hiring them, and they're turning out to be incredible workers
they're given a chance
they're really given a second   given a third chance, in some cases
but i've had numerous employers come up and say, i'll tell you what, i've taken people that were in prison, and we've hired them
he wouldn't have done this in a normal economy or a bad economy   only in this kind of an economy
and now, he's like the biggest fan   one man in particular
he's taken numerous people
he said most of them have been unbelievable
all you can ask is most
but most of them have been unbelievable
that's a great thing
that's a really great thing
it gives them a chance
so before we take questions, i want to extend our warmest condolences to the country of indonesia
a friend of mine   we're going to be calling up the leader, who is a great leader indeed
but they got hit by a giant tsunami, like people have not seen
this part of the world hasn't seen it so much, fortunately
they say that's the worst of all
you look at the tornados, the hurricanes
you look at all of the different natural disasters
a friend of mine who studies natural disasters   i don't know why he does that, but he does   he says that tsunami is the worst of all
and they got hit very hard, and probably thousands of people killed
we have already sent a lot of first responders and military and others to help, but it's a really bad, bad situation
and finally, before closing, i want to send our thoughts and prayers to the victims of the las vegas shooting
that was a horrible, horrible time in the life of our country
it took place exactly one year ago today
all of america is grieving for the lives lost and for the families they left behind
so to all of those families, and to the people of las vegas
we love you
we are with you
we're working with you very hard
that was a terrible, terrible event
so thank you very much for that
i want to ask bob lighthizer, who is just a terrific individual as well as a man that knows a lot about this subject, to come up and say a word about the usmca   the new agreement
and if you have any questions, we'll take some questions after that
please, bob
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much, bob
thank you very much
some questions
yes, steve
question
yes
i don't think it did
he's a professional
i'm a professional
we had very strong tensions
it was just an unfair deal, whether it was mexico or canada
and now it's a fair deal for everybody
it's a much different deal
it's a brand new deal
it's not nafta redone
it's a brand new deal
i just spoke with him
we have a great relationship, and we're going to work as a partner
don't forget, the rest of the world is looking to take advantage of us, and   as a region, you might say
and we're going to work very closely together with canada and with mexico because we'll be able to compete with anybody
we have things that nobody else has
we have energy that nobody else has
we have timber that nobody else has
we have things that no other part of the world has, to the extent that we have
so we're going to do very well together
i think we have   there was a lot of tension, i will say, between he and i   i think, more specifically
and it's all worked out
you know when it ended
about 12 o'clock last night
but he's a good man
he's a done a good job
and he loves the people of canada
well, we'll see what happens with china
we have lost $375 billion in trade deficits
they have a surplus of $375 billion   with a b   with the united states
and it's been that way for years, and years, and years
i always say, we rebuilt china
they took that money, and they built fighter jets, and they built bridges
they built more bridges than we built in the last 100 years, probably   big ones
like the george washington bridge   like big bridges
and i'm not going to take, you know
look, i don't blame china
i blame our leadership
they should have never let that happen
and i told that to president xi
i said, you know…   i was making a speech in china, and i was really hitting china hard
and i'm in china
i don't know if that's a good thing to do
but i looked at him, and i said, but, you know, i don't really blame you
i blame our leadership for allowing this to happen
he knew exactly what i meant
we had no deal with china
i asked one of the top people in china   a representative at the highest level came to the oval office
i said, let me ask you, how did this ever happen
he's a pro, so he understands
he doesn't have to be cute
he said, nobody ever did anything from the united states
when we put on a 25 percent tariff on every car that comes from the united states into china, we thought we would be rebuked
we thought it would be terrible
nobody ever called
nobody did anything
that was years ago
and we charged them nothing   2
5 , but we don't collect it
we do now, by the way
but we don't collect the 2
so they charge 25 , we charge essentially nothing
but i said, how did it happen
he said, nobody ever called
we don't have a deal with china
there is no deal
they do whatever they want
so we have a tremendous problem with theft of intellectual property with china
we have a lot of other problems with china
we have primarily trade problems
and, as you know, they're having a much more difficult time now
i don't want them to have a difficult time
and we're doing better than we've ever done
everybody talked about the tariffs
oh, the tariffs, tariffs… you know, tariffs ended in 1913, and they then went to a different system in 1918   totally unrelated
and then in 1928, you had the great depression for a lot of different reasons   not necessarily our country's fault, but a little bit our country's fault
and then, in the 1930s, they said, we better start charging some tariffs
we need money to come into our country again
okay
so i'm not advocating tariffs
i will tell you this
our steel industry, wilbur, is stronger than it's been in 25 years
this has taken six months because i charged for the dumpers
they were dumping steel and dumping aluminum into our country
i charged 25 percent
that's a lot
could be more, but that's a lot
and if you look at u
steel and nucor   nucor just announced a billion-dollar plant   brand new
already started construction
steel is building eight or nine plants
they're expanding plants
i don't think there's any industry like what's happened to steel in the last nine months, ten months since i really started doing what i'm doing
it's been really pretty amazing
aluminum, also
so   and we need steel
we need steel for defense
what are we going to do
go and say, oh, we'll get our steel from an   like another country
we can't do that
excuse me
we can't do that
so we need steel and we need it badly for defense
so i'm very proud of what's happened with the steel industry
okay, question
yeah
go ahead
sure
she's shocked that i picked her
she's like in a state of shock
that's okay
i know you're not thinking
you never do
no, go ahead
go ahead
what does that have to do with trade
i don't mind answering the question
but, you know, i'd like to do the trade questions first
no, but   i know
but how about talking about trade, and then we'll get to that
we'll do that a little bit later
anybody have a trade   go ahead, please
i think so
but, you know, if it doesn't, we have lots of other alternatives
but i do think so
i think, if they're fair   which is a big question   but if it's fair on both sides   the republicans love it
industry loves it
our country loves it
if it's fair, it will pass
i think it will pass easily, really easily   because it's a great deal
i mean, nafta passed
it's one of the worst deals i've ever seen   inconceivable that it was made
fair question
any other questions on trade
i'll get back to you on the other question
let's do that later, and we'll   but i'll call you a second time
go ahead, please
thank you very much
well, india charges us tremendous tariffs when we send harley-davidsons motorcycles, other things to india
they charge very, very high tariffs
and i've spoken to prime minister modi, and he's going to reduce them very substantially
nobody ever spoke to these people
he said, nobody ever spoke to me
in other words, we've had leaders here   i'm not, you know, trying to be overly dramatic
we've had presidents of the united states and trade representative that   they never spoke to india
brazil is another one
that's a beauty
they charge us whatever they want
if you ask some of the companies, they say brazil is among the toughest in the world, maybe the toughest in the world
we don't call them and say, hey, you're treating our companies unfairly
you're treating our country unfairly
so india is a very, very high   they really charged tremendously high tariffs
on motorcycles, it was a 100 percent
so you send a motorcycle into india   there's a 100 percent tariff
now, that's so high that it's like a barrier
in other words, who's going to buy it
it cost you so much
now they've already reduced that substantially, but it's still too high
my relationship with india is great, with prime minister modi is great
and they're going to start doing a lot
they've already   they've called us to make a deal
we didn't even call them
they called us to make a deal, which is, like, shocking to people
yes, sir
go ahead
yes
let's go
first, do a trade
it means   it means
the steel is staying where it is   and aluminum
but it means we probably, for the most part, won't be having to use tariffs unless we're unable to make a deal with a country
for instance, if we can't make a deal with the european union, we will respectfully put tariffs on the cars
the united states will take in billions and billions of dollars into its coffers
isn't that nice
because you don't hear that
because it doesn't take in   okay
yeah, sagan
but it will take in billions and billions of dollars
but really, what's going to happen is, they'll make the cars in the united states
this way, they don't have to pay the 25 or the 20 percent tax
thank you very much
please, sit down
today, i'm very honored to host the president of poland, a friend of mine, president duda, and mrs
duda
thank you very much for being here
great honor
it's lovely to have you at the white house
we spent some time in the oval office, and we accomplished a lot
melania and i are deeply grateful for the incredible welcome the president and mrs
duda gave us in warsaw, poland last year
it was a very exceptional day
extraordinary
it's wonderful to have them both with us in washington today
thank you very much, mr
president
during my visit last summer, i had the privilege to stand before the monument to the warsaw uprising and address the people of poland about our shared commitment to defending our heritage and our civilization
it was an experience i will always treasure and i will never, ever forget
not far from where we stand today, another monument in another square   the statue of general kosciuszko in lafayette park   reminds us that the bonds between our people go all the way back to america's revolutionary war
this year, the united states and poland are celebrating 100 years of poland regaining its independence and nearly 100 years of u
-polish diplomatic ties
it's a long time
i'm thrilled to say that the alliance between our nations has never been stronger with you and i at the helm
do you agree with that
thank you, mr
president
i'm glad he said yes
in our discussions this afternoon, president duda and i agreed to bolster our robust defense ties
we will enhance cooperation in military relations, intelligence, missile defense, technology and training
i'm proud to report that poland has recently purchased a state-of-the-art patriot missile system   which is a great system
we make the greatest military equipment by far, anywhere in the world
and it's made right here in the usa
we are grateful for poland's leadership on defense spending and burden sharing in nato
i want to commend poland for meeting its nato defense-spending obligations, and i am glad that it plans to increase spending beyond the 2 percent minimum obligation
thank you very much for that
i'd like to share my gratitude to the people of poland for their contributions to nato's resolute support mission in afghanistan and the coalition to defeat isis
we've made tremendous progress with respect to the defeat of isis, as you've seen
we also understand that you can't have national security without border security
both poland and the united states understand that strong nations must have very strong borders
the president and i likewise are exploring opportunities to advance energy security
the united states and poland are deeply committed to energy diversity all across europe
no nation should be dependent upon a single foreign supplier of energy
poland has worked tirelessly to increase energy independence nationally and across central europe
it is constructing a new pipeline   the highest technology   from norway to poland, and it recently built a liquefied natural gas import facility
last year, the united states was proud to send its first export of lng to poland, and soon, our nations will launch a high-level diplomatic exchange on energy security
and, mr
president, we are now, as of a few months ago, the largest producer of energy in the world
so that was   that's a big statement
president duda, i also just want to talk to you about the three seas summit, where central european leaders were working hard to increase energy market access, reduce energy trade barriers   which is something we have to get done with respect to the european union
the trade barriers, they make it very difficult for the united states   and to strengthen energy independence
the united states firmly supports these goals, and we are eager to expand commercial ties all across the region of europe
in our meeting today, the president and i discussed our bilateral economic relationship at length
poland has experienced more than a quarter century of uninterrupted economic growth   which is a very big statement
very few can say that
and we look forward to further enhancing trade, investment, and commerce between our two great nations
my administration is committed to realizing a future of prosperity and opportunity for all americans
this month, we celebrated the highest employment level in u
history
we are right now employing more people
we have more workers in the united states than at any time ever in u
history
i look forward to partnering with president duda as we grow our economies together
president, thank you for joining me today
poland has chosen its place among the free and independent nations of the world and as a loyal ally and strategic partner of the united states
and we greatly appreciate that
we welcome the next 100 years of friendship between our two nations
president, thank you very much
thank you
thank you
a tremendous amount of lng will be exported to poland
we're giving them a pretty good price, but they're buying a lot of it, and that's going to be great
i do want to say that, while we're together, tremendous effort and bravery is being shown in north carolina, south carolina, virginia, and the area that was so horribly hit by hurricane florence
i just got some clips of some of the things that the coast guard is doing and getting people to safety in horrible, horrible conditions
and i want to just salute all of the people that are working so hard
the first responders, law enforcement, the military, fema
the job they're doing is incredible
it's incredible
so i just want to thank them very much
and i think what we'll do is we'll take our first question from emerald robinson of one america news
emerald
well, i just heard about the incident you have mentioned, emerald, and it sounds to me and it seems to me, just like based on a review of the facts, that syria shot down a russian plane
and i understand about 14 people were killed, at least
and that's a very sad thing
but that's what happens
but syria   according to early reports
that's subject to change   but that syria shot down a russian plane
so that's not a good situation
we have done a tremendous job in syria and in that region eradicating isis, which is why we're there
and we're very close to being finished with that job, and then we're going to make a determination as to what we're going to do
but we have eradicated isis in a very large area of the middle east
these are people that will not be coming here because they're not around any longer
so we've done in a very short period of time
our vice president is here, mike pence
our great secretary of state   really, thank you very much for the great job you're doing   mike pompeo
and we've been working very hard on this
and they've done an incredible job over there, but we'll make a decision fairly quickly
thank you very much
would you have a question for the president
and i think it should be pointed out that the president also said, and he also said it publicly, that he would pay the united states   meaning poland would be paying billions of dollars for a base
and we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid
it's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people
and we should help them
we don't expect anything for that
but when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the united states, they're only taking advantage of us
and we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment
payment
and we get along with them very well, but it's not fair
that includes nato
as you know, i got $44 billion additional last year, where they paid an additional   you can speak to secretary general stoltenberg, who is the head of nato, and he said he's never seen anything like it
and this year we did even better
but when a country is very wealthy, and when the united states has been protecting them for many years at tremendous cost   cost like nobody in this room would believe   it's time that they help with, we call it, burden sharing
and they will do that
but the president offered us much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we're looking at it
we're looking at it from the standpoint of, number one, military protection for both countries, and also cost   a term you don't hear too often and you haven't heard too often over the last 25 years
but that's the way it has to be
thank you very much
would you like to have a question, please
i do
i actually do
i think it's a very aggressive situation
i think russia has acted aggressively
they respect force
they respect strength, as anyone does
and we have the greatest strength in the world   especially now
we were being depleted under the last administration
we had planes that were old and tired, and didn't fly, in some cases
they were getting used parts
this is the united states
it doesn't happen
we make the greatest planes in the world, and missiles in the world
and we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military
it's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine
they never had it so good because i got, in congress, $700 billion this year
$716 billion last year
that's far more than they ever anticipated
i viewed it two ways
number one, military   because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs
but number two is jobs
we make everything here
so it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world
and russia respects that
they respect that
so i am with the president
i feel that he's right
and i feel that, look, you look at the history of poland and russia   that's a long and very complicated history
so certainly has a right to feel that way
okay
jon decker of fox, please
it wouldn't bother me, other than the fbi, jon, said that they really don't do that
that's not what they do
now, they have done, supposedly, six background checks over the years, as judge kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder
he's an incredible individual
great intellect, great judge
impeccable history in every way   in every way
i feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you
i feel so badly for him
this is not a man that deserves this
this should have been brought to the fore
it should have been brought up long ago
and that's what you have hearings for
you don't wait until the hearing is over and then, all of a sudden, bring it up
when senator feinstein sat with judge kavanaugh for a long period of time   a long, long meeting   she had this letter
why didn't she bring it up
why didn't she bring it up then
why didn't the democrats bring it up then
because they obstruct and because they resist
that's the name of their campaign against me
they just resist and they just obstruct
and, frankly, i think they're lousy on policy, and in many ways, they're lousy politicians
but they're very good on obstruction
and it's shame, because this is a great gentleman
with all of that, i feel that the republicans   and i can speak for myself   we should go through a process, because there shouldn't even be a little doubt
there shouldn't be a doubt
again, they knew what they were doing
they should have done this a long time ago   three months ago   not now
but they did it now
so i don't want to play into their hands
hopefully, the woman will come forward, state her case
he will state his case before representatives of the united states senate
and then they will vote
they will look at his career
they will look at what she had to say from 36 years ago
and we will see what happens
but i just think he is at a level that we rarely see not only in government, anywhere in life
and honestly, i feel terribly for him, for his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman, and for his beautiful young daughters
i feel terribly for them
well, we just started
we didn't do anything with respect to china because we wanted to have the benefit of china having to do with north korea
and they have been helpful
i hope they're still helpful
there's a question about that
but it got to a point where the numbers were too big
this should have been done for the last 20 years
if you look at the wto, the world trade organization, that's when china really happened, economically
that's   it was like a rocket ship, because they took advantage of the rules of the wto
and whoever was standing at this podium in this incredible white house, in the oval office, they should have done something about this long ago
over the last number of years, china has taken out of this country $500 billion and more   a year
$500 billion
that would go a long way for poland, wouldn't it
you could rebuild your whole country
and that's what china did
they rebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the united states
and i've changed that around
and if you look at what's going on, our market is going up like a rocket ship
i don't want their market to go down, but their market is down 32 percent in three months
because we can't let them do anymore what they've done
and i watch trade deficits, because to me, deficits are very important
they're not everything, and they're not exact
sometimes you can have, you know, a deficit, and that's not such a bad thing
but when you have $375 billion in trade deficits, and then many billions of dollars in other liabilities of all different types, you have to do something about it
we are the piggybank to the world
we have been ripped off by china
we've been ripped off by   excuse me, mr
president   the european union, of which you're a part of
we've been ripped off by everybody
and i want to protect the american worker, the american farmer, the ranchers, the companies
and we're not being ripped off, you will see, in a little while
speaking of that, we've come to a conclusion with mexico
we have a wonderful deal for both parties
it was a very one-sided deal
now it's a good deal for both parties
very happy with it
the new president had conversation and it was terrific
i think we're going to have a very good relationship
we'll see
we'll see
we want help on the border because we have the worst immigration laws in the history of mankind or womankind
we have horrible, horrible immigration laws, so we want help
but we've come to a conclusion with mexico
canada has taken advantage of our country for a long time
we love canada
we love it
love the people of canada
but they are in a position that's not a good position for canada
they cannot continue to charge us 300 percent tariff on dairy products, and that's what they're doing
so this is a process
it takes a little time
the european union wouldn't talk to us
they wouldn't talk to president obama
wouldn't even talk to him
and then i said, that's okay, you don't have to talk to me
jean-claude is a tough man
he's a very good man
i like him, but he's tough
he's nasty
the kind of guy i want negotiating for me
but he's a tough, tough cookie
and i said to him, we have to renegotiate the deal
he said, but, mr
president, we are very happy with the deal
we don't want to negotiate
i said, you may be happy with the deal, but i'm not happy with the deal
and he didn't want to renegotiate
and after three times, he still didn't want to renegotiate
i said, that's okay, we don't have to renegotiate any longer
we're going to put a tariff on all of the millions of cars you send into the united states
and honestly, he was in my office so quickly, from europe, that i didn't know they had airplanes that flew that fast
i said, where did you find this plane
and we have the semblance of a deal
because it's, to a large extent, economically all about cars
cars are a very big factor
and they send millions of bmws and mercedes into our country
so we are working on trade very hard
it's very important to me
it has been for 30 years
i've been saying for 30 years
it started with japan
i talked about japan
i was right
i talked about china
i was right
it's what i do
and i like doing it
but i like doing it for the people because our country has been abused and taken advantage of by virtually every country that it does business with
and we're just not letting that happen anymore
and that includes what i said previously about the military
please
the trade deal with south korea has been fully renegotiated and is ready for signature
we may sign it at the united nations or shortly thereafter
that was a terrible deal for the united states
now it's a fair deal
but that's been fully renegotiated, in addition to mexico and some of the others that are very close
thank you very much, everybody
we appreciate it
thank you
thank you very much
thank you
i have just concluded a meeting with president putin on a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries
we had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue
went very well
before i begin, i want to thank president niinisto of finland for graciously hosting today's summit
president putin and i were saying how lovely it was and what a great job they did
i also want to congratulate russia and president putin for having done such an excellent job in hosting the world cup
it was really one of the best ever
and your team also did very well
it was a great job
i'm here today to continue the proud tradition of bold american diplomacy
from the earliest days of our republic, american leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility
a productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia, but it is good for the world
the disagreements between our two countries are well known and president putin and i discussed them at length today
but if we're going to solve many of the problems facing our world, then we're going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests
too often, in both recent past and long ago, we have seen the consequences when diplomacy is left on the table
we've also seen the benefits of cooperation
in the last century, our nations fought alongside one another in the second world war
even during the tensions of the cold war, when the world looked much different than it does today, the united states and russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue
but our relationship has never been worse than it is now
however, that changed as of about four hours ago
i really believe that
nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage, but that would not accomplish anything
as president, i cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics, or the media, or democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct
constructive dialogue between the united states and russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world
i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics
as president, i will always put what is best for america and what is best for the american people
during today's meeting, i addressed directly with president putin the issue of russian interference in our elections
i felt this was a message best delivered in person
spent a great deal of time talking about it
and president putin may very well want to address it, and very strongly, because he feels very strongly about it, and he has an interesting idea
we also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity
nuclear proliferation
i provided an update on my meeting last month with chairman kim on the denuclearization of north korea
and after today, i am very sure that president putin and russia want very much to end that problem, going to work with us
and i appreciate that commitment
the president and i also discussed the scourge of radical islamic terrorism
both russia and the united states has suffered horrific terrorist attacks, and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace
last year, we told russia about a planned attack in st
petersburg, and they were able to stop it cold
they found them
they stopped them
there was no doubt about it
i appreciated president putin's phone call afterwards to thank me
i also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on iran to halt its nuclear ambitions, and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area, throughout the middle east
as we discussed at length, the crisis in syria is a complex one
cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives
i also made clear that the united states will not allow iran to benefit from our successful campaign against isis
we have just about eradicated isis in the area
we also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today, and to continue the progress we have started right here in helsinki
today's meeting is only the beginning of a longer process, but we have taken the first step toward a brighter future and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought
our expectations are grounded in realism, but our hopes are grounded in america's desire for friendship, cooperation and peace
and i think i can speak on behalf of russia, when i say that, also
president putin, i want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between russia and the united states
our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between russia, the united states, for the greater good of all
and this was a very constructive day, this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together
it's in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation, and we have agreed to do so
i'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future often, and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today
so again, president putin, thank you very much
well, actually i called him a competitor
and a good competitor he is
and i think the word competitor is a compliment
i think that we will be completing when you talk about the pipeline
i'm not sure, necessarily, that it's in the best interests of germany or not, but that was a decision that they made
we'll be competing   as you know, the united states is now   or soon will be, but i think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world
so we're going to be selling lng, and we'll have to be competing with the pipeline and i think will compete successfully, although there is a little advantage locationally
so i just wish them luck
i mean, i did
i discussed with angela merkel in pretty strong tones
but i also know where they're all coming from and they have a very close source
so we'll see how that all works out
but we have lots of sources now and the united states is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren't unable to extract what we could extract today
so today we're number one in the world at that, and i think we'll be out there competing very strongly
thank you very much
yes i do
i hold both countries responsible
i think that the united states has been foolish
i think we've all been foolish
we should've had this dialogue a long time ago
a long time, frankly, before i got to office
and i think we're all to blame
i think that the united states now has stepped forward along with russia, and we're getting together and we have a chance to do some great things, whether it's nuclear proliferation in terms of stopping   you have to do it, ultimately that's probably the most important thing that we could be working on
but i do feel that we have both made some mistakes
i think that the   the probe is a disaster for our country
i think it's kept us apart, it's kept us separated
there was no collusion at all
everybody knows it
and people are being brought out to the fore
so far that i know, virtually none of it related to the campaign
and they're going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign
that was a clean campaign
i beat hillary clinton easily
and, frankly, we beat her   and i'm not even saying from the standpoint   we won that race
and it's a shame that there could even be a little bit of a cloud over it
people know that, people understand it
but the main thing   and we discussed this also   zero collusion
and it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world
we have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries
it's ridiculous
it's ridiculous what's going on with the probe
well, i'm going to let the president answer the second part of that question
but, as you know, the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before, but it came out as a reason why the democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the electoral college is much more advantageous for democrats, as you know, than it is to republicans
we won the electoral college by a lot
306 to 223, i believe
and that was a well-fought   that was a well-fought battle
we did a great job
and, frankly   i'm going to let the president speak to the second part of your question   but just to say it one time again   and i say it all the time   there was no collusion
i didn't know the president
there was nobody to collude with
there was no collusion with the campaign
and every time you hear all of these, you know, 12 and 14   it's stuff that has nothing to do   and, frankly, they admit these are not people involved in the campaign
but to the average reader out there, they're saying, well, maybe that does
it doesn't
and even the people involved, some, perhaps, told mis-stories
or, in one case, the fbi said there was no lying
there was no lying
somebody else said there was
we ran a brilliant campaign, and that's why i'm president
thank you
well, i guess i'll answer the first part of the question
we've worked with israel long and hard for many years, many decades
i think we've never   never has anyone, any country been closer than we are
president putin also is helping israel
and we both spoke with bibi netanyahu, and they would like to do certain things with respect to syria, having to do with the safety of israel
so in that respect, we absolutely would like to work in order to help israel
and israel would be working with us
so both countries would work jointly
and i think that when you look at all of the progress that's been made in certain sections, with the eradication of isis, we're about 98 percent, 99 percent there
and other things that have taken place that we've done, and that, frankly, russia has helped us with in certain respects
but i think that working with israel is a great thing
and creating safety for israel is something that both president putin and i would like to see very much
one little thing i might add to that is the helping of people
helping of people
because you have such horrible   if you see   and i've seen reports, i've seen pictures, i've seen just about everything
and if we can do something to help the people of syria get back into some form of shelter, and   on a humanitarian basis   and that's what the word was, really, a humanitarian basis   i think that both of us would be very interested in doing that
and we are
we will do that
thank you very much
well, our militaries do get along
in fact, our militaries actually have gotten along probably better than our political leaders, for years
but our militaries do get along very well, and they do coordinate in syria and other places
thank you
thank you very much
we do host it and we hope we do as good a job
that's very nice
that will go to my son barron
we have no question
in fact, melania, here you go
so let me just say that we have two thoughts
you have groups that are wondering why the fbi never took the server   haven't they taken the server
why was the fbi told to leave the office of the democratic national committee
i've been wondering that, i've been asking that for months and months and i've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media
where is the server
i want to know where is the server and what is the server saying
with that being said, all i can do is ask the question
my people came to me, dan coats came to me and some others, they said they think it's russia
i have president putin
he just said it's not russia
i will say this
i don't see any reason why it would be
but i really do want to see the server
but i have   i have confidence in both parties
i   i really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but i don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server
what happened to the servers of the pakistani gentleman that worked on the d
where are those servers
they're missing
where are they
what happened to hillary clinton's e-mails
33,000 e-mails gone   just gone
i think in russia they wouldn't be gone so easily
i think it's a disgrace that we can't get hillary clinton's 33,000 e-mails
so i have great confidence in my intelligence people, but i will tell you that president putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today
and what he did is an incredible offer
he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people
i think that's an incredible offer
thank you
yes, please
it would have been out long ago
and if anybody watched peter strzok testify over the last couple of days   and i was in brussels watching it   it was a disgrace to the fbi, it was a disgrace to our country, and you would say that was a total witch hunt
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
well, thank you very much, everybody
appreciate it
we've had a very amazing two-day period in brussels
and we really accomplished a lot, with respect to nato
for years, presidents have been coming to these meetings and talked about the expense   the tremendous expense for the united states
and tremendous progress has been made
everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment
they're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before
prior to last year, where i attended my first meeting, it was going down   the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially
and now, it's going up very substantially
and commitments were made
only 5 of 29 countries were making their commitment
and that's now changed
the commitment was at 2 percent
ultimately, that'll be going up quite a bit higher than that
so we are   we made a tremendous amount of progress today
it's been about, at a minimum, they estimate   and they're going to be giving you exact numbers   but since last year, they've raise an additional $33 billion that's been put up by the various countries, not including the united states
and the united states' commitment to nato is very strong, remains very strong, but primarily because everyone   the spirit they have, the amount of money they're willing to spend, the additional money that they will be putting up has been really, really amazing to see it
to see the level of spirit in that room is incredible
and i hope that we're going to be able to get along with russia
i think that we probably will be able to
the people in the room think so, but they nevertheless   they really stepped up their commitment, and stepped it up like they never have before
so took in an addition $33
the number could actually be higher than $40  when they give you the final number
the secretary general, stoltenberg, will be giving those numbers sometime today, probably in his concluding press statement
but we are doing numbers like they've never done before or ever seen before
and you'll be seeing that, and i guess you'll be hearing that a little bit later
okay
we have our secretary of state, as you know, and we have   john is here
so if you have any questions for the three of us
mike pompeo just got back from a third trip, as you know, to north korea
he's become a true expert on the trips to north korea   the best way to get there, the best way to get out
and he gets along very well
and he's doing a great job over there
yes, ma'am
yes
i told people that i'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially, because the united states has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the cost of nato
and now, people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitments
so i let them know yesterday, actually
i was surprised that you didn't pick it up
it took until today
but yesterday, i let them know that i was extremely unhappy with what was happening, and they have substantially upped their commitment, yeah
and now we're very happy and have a very, very powerful, very, very strong nato, much stronger than it was two days ago
yes, ma'am
yes, hi
how are you
i know
you're very famous on television
well, they were probably worried because the united states was not being treated fairly, but now we are, because the commitment has been upped so much
so now they are
and i was very firm yesterday
you have to understand, i know a lot of the people in the room
i was here last year
i let them know last year   in a less firm manner, but pretty firm   and they raised an additional $33 billion, i think going to $40 billion
but it's $33 billion as of today
and then today and yesterday, i was probably a little bit more firm
but i believe in nato
i think nato is a very important   probably the greatest ever done
but the united states was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate
that's not fair to the united states
in addition to that, as you know, we're in negotiations with the eu, and we're going to be meeting with them next week
we've been treated very unfairly on trade
our farmers have been shut out of the european union
now, you could say they're different, but basically, to a large extent, they're the same countries
so i think we're going to be ultimately treated fairly on trade
we'll see what happens, but i can tell you that nato now is really a fine-tuned machine
people are paying money that they never paid before
they're happy to do it
and the united states is being treated much more fairly
yes, sir
well, if you consider putting up tremendously   you know, the additional funds at a level that nobody has ever seen before, i don't think that's helping russia
i think that nato is much stronger now than it was two days ago
i think that nato was not doing what they were supposed to be doing   a lot of the countries
and we were doing much more than we should have been doing
frankly, we were carrying too much of a burden
that's why we call it burden-sharing
i was using the term a lot today
burden-sharing
we had a fantastic meeting at the end   29 countries
and they are putting up a lot
germany has increased very substantially their time period, and germany is coming along
and we still have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline, because the pipeline is coming in from russia
so we're going to have to figure that out
i brought it up
nobody brought it up but me, and we all are talking about it now
and actually, i think the world is talking about it now maybe more than anything else
but we're going to figure that out
but   and, frankly, maybe everybody is going to have a good relationship with russia so there will be a lot less problem with the pipeline
but, to me, that was a very major point of contention
we discussed it at length today
germany has agreed to do a lot better than they were doing, and we're very happy with that
we had a very good relationship with angela merkel
yes
yeah, go ahead
yes
after all these years, i know, margaret
go ahead
i think i probably can, but that's unnecessary
and the people have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before
and remember the word   $33 billion more, they're paying
and you'll hear that from the secretary general in a little while
he thanked me actually
he actually thanked me
and everybody in the room thanked me
there's a great collegial spirit in that room that i don't think they've had in many years
they're very strong
so, yeah, very unified, very strong
no problem
right
yes, go ahead
no problem
go ahead
so what they're doing is spending at a much faster clip
they're going up to the 2 percent level
now, you have to understand, some of them have parliaments, they have their own congresses, they have a lot of things they have to go through
so, you know, they're here as prime minister or a as a president, and they can't necessarily go in and say, this is what we're going to do
but they're going back for approvals
some are at 2 percent
others have agreed definitely to go to 2 percent
and some are going back to get the approval, and which they will get, to go to 2 percent
after the 2 percent, we'll start talking about going higher
but i said, ultimately we should be, in years   in advance   we should be at 4 percent
i think 4 percent, it's the right number
now, the united states   depending on the way you calculate it   was at 4
2 percent
and i said, that's unfair
and we have the largest gdp by far, especially since we've increased it by so much since a thing called the election
our gdp has gone way up
and so the fact that our gdp went way up, that means we're paying for even more, which is very unfair
so i explained that
we will go to much higher than 2 percent into the future, but right now we're getting people up to 2 percent, and that will take place over a fairly short period of time   a short number of years
okay
yeah, go ahead
congratulations, by the way
on soccer
no, that's other people that do that
i don't
i'm very consistent
i'm a very stable genius
go ahead
yeah, go ahead
hi, jeremy
no, many of them   in fact, germany was going to be in the year 2028 or '30
yeah, i think it's a very effective way to deal, but i didn't deal exactly the way you said
i have great respect for germany
my father is from germany
both of my parents are from the eu, despite the fact they don't treat us well on trade
but i think that will change also, and i think we'll see that   because on the 25th of july, they're coming in to start negotiations with me
we'll see
and if they don't negotiate in good faith, we'll do something having to do with all of the millions of cars that are coming into our country and being taxed at a virtually zero level, at a very low level
but, jeremy, i think it's been a very effective way of negotiating
but i'm not negotiating
i just want fairness for the united states
we're paying for far too much of nato
nato is very important
but nato is helping europe more than it's helping us
at the same time, it's very good for us
so we have now got it to a point where people are paying a lot more money, and that's starting   really, last year
it really had   you were there last year
and last year we had a big impact
again, we took in $33 billion more
and if you ask secretary general stoltenberg, he gives us total credit   meaning me, i guess, in this case, total credit   because i said it was unfair
now, what has happened is, presidents over many years, from ronald reagan to barack obama, they came in, they said, okay, hey, do the best you can, and they left
nobody did anything about it
and it got to a point where the united states was paying for 90 percent of nato
and that's not fair
so it's changed
we had a really good meeting today
we had a great meeting in terms of getting along
i know most of the people in the room because of last year, because of the year and a half that we've been in office   year and a half-plus
but we have a great relationship
everybody in that room, by the time we left, got along
and they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly
yeah, go ahead, phil
i think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries
i think it's   the way we have it now, i think it's a much   i think nato got   you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office
the numbers were going down
now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship
the numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly
and they're now going up further
so i think nato is going to be very, very effective
i'm very impressed with   and really know, and he's a friend mine   but secretary general stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together
and we were the ones that really   we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know
i think he's done a really good job
i think that when i was saying that i am very concerned with the pipeline, i don't like the pipeline
and when i talk about nato, i say, how do you have nato
and then you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against
but maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against
i think that's a real possibility
as you know, i'm meeting with president putin on monday
and i think we go into that meeting not looking for so much
we want to find out about syria
we will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling
i will be asking that question again
but we'll also be talking about other things
we'll be talking about ukraine
ukraine was here today, by the way
and, you know, it was very interesting to hear what they had to say
excuse me
well, he may
i mean, look, he may
you know, what am i going to do
he may deny it
i mean, it's one of those things
all i can do is say, did you and don't do it again
but he may deny it
you'll be the first to know
okay
yes, go ahead
yes
hi, robert
well, they will
they will
i have no doubt about it
they all made commitments
and they will be up to 2 percent
it will be over a period   a relatively short period of years
okay
yes, go ahead
georgia
they were here today, representing
well, they were here
they made a very favorable impression
and we listened to their plight
it's a tough situation with georgia
but they made a very fair verbal impression in the room
okay
yeah, go ahead
go ahead
yeah, you really did
come on
go ahead
go ahead
go ahead
oh, that's an interesting question   because long before i got here, president obama allowed that to happen
that was on his watch, not on my watch
you know, people like to say, oh, crimea
but the fact is, they built bridges to crimea
they just opened a big bridge that was started years ago
they built, i think, a submarine port
substantially added billions of dollars
so that was on barack obama's watch
that was not on trump's watch
would i have allowed it to happen
no, i would not have allowed it to happen
but he did allow it to happen, so that was his determination
what will happen with crimea from this point on
that i can't tell you
but i'm not happy about crimea
but again, that was on barack obama's watch, not trump's watch
yeah, go ahead
sure
sure
i know, jeff
yes
yes
well, perhaps we'll talk about that
but i will say that we are going to be talking about those three issues and many more
we'll be talking about it, jeff
go ahead
go ahead
well, the money will be spent properly
and one of the things that we have   we have many wealthy countries with us today, but we have some that aren't so wealthy
and they did ask if they could buy the military equipment and could i help them out
and we will help them out a little bit
we're not going to finance it for them, but we'll make sure that they're able to get payments and various other things so they can buy
because the united states makes, by far, the best military equipment in the world
the best jets, the best missiles, the best guns
the best everything   we make, by far
i mean, that's one thing   i guess i assumed it prior to taking office, but i really learned, since being president, our equipment is so much better than anybody else's equipment when you look at our companies   lockheed and boeing and grumman
the material   the equipment that we make is so far superior, everybody wants to buy our equipment
in fact, it's the question, can they make it
because they are doing very well
can they make it for so many people
so we are helping some of those countries get on line and buy the best equipment
yeah, go ahead
yeah
just the opposite of concern
they actually   and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict   but they actually thanked me for meeting with president putin
i look forward to the meeting
they thanked me
they thought it was a great thing that i was doing it
and they gave us our best wishes, or their best wishes
now, with that being said, we'll see that happens
just a loose meeting
it's not going to be big schedule
i don't think it should take a very long period of time
and we'll see where it leads
but it could lead to productive   something very productive
and maybe it's not
but i think meeting with people is great
we had a great meeting with chairman kim
and i'll tell you, mike pompeo did a fantastic job
i might ask you to say a few words, mike, while you're here
just one second
mike, go ahead
i think, just to finish on that, you know, it's so important
that was an amazing   really, an amazing meeting, i though
and i really think that we established a very good relationship
we'll see where it all ends
but there have been no missile tests
there have been no research
where there has been   they have blown up a site
i hear they're blowing up another site, missile site
they've taken down all of the propaganda
in fact, somebody said there's no more music playing at the border line
you know, the music was going on for many years
they said recently that, wow, there's no more of the heavy music and the propaganda
they've done a lot of things
and we got back our three hostages
so it's a good process
but the main thing is there have been no rocket launches
there have been no missile tests
there's been no nuclear tests, no explosions, no nothing, for almost nine months
okay
yeah, please
i think it's fine
i mean, i think they like me a lot in the uk
i think they agree with me on immigration
i'm very strong on immigration
i made a point today   i said, you've got to stop
you're ruining your   you're going to have a lot of problems
you see what's going on throughout the world with immigration
i probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration
if you look at italy   giuseppe, who i got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on italy
i think that a lot of the people in the uk   i think that's why brexit happened
now, i don't know what's going on with the negotiation
who knows
but   and i guess that's become a very interesting point of contention
i said i'm going to a few hotspots
we have nato, then we have the uk, and then we have putin
and i said, putin may be the easiest of them all
you never know
but i'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations
but i will say that immigration is a very important thing, and i told them today, the eu   the european union   better be very careful, because immigration is taking over europe, and they better be very, very careful
and i said that loud and clear
yes, go ahead
well, i think he's going to see about this summit   this has turned out to be a very successful summit
this is   i think, really, that nato is more put together right now, is more coordinated
and i think there's a better spirit for nato right now than perhaps they've ever had
it's richer than it ever was
the commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made
and the money, it will be paid out faster   far faster
you know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal
it wasn't something that they were committed to
now it's a commitment
there's a big difference   the 2 percent number
and that's why so many people weren't reaching it or hitting it
it was just sort of like this amorphous number out there
now it's a commitment, a real commitment
i think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps
and i think we're going to have a good meeting
regardless of that, i think we're going to have a good meeting
but this was a fantastic two days
this was a really fantastic   it all came together at the end
and, yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately   you can ask anybody at that meeting   they're really liking what happened over the last two days
there's a great, great spirit leaving that room
yes, sir
go ahead
please
well, he's a competitor
he's been very nice to me the times i've met him
i've been nice to him
he's a competitor
you know, somebody was saying, is he an enemy
no, he's not my enemy
is he a friend
no, i don't know him well enough
but the couple of times that i've gotten to meet him, we got along very well
you saw that
i hope we get along well
i think we get along well
but ultimately, he's a competitor
he's representing russia
i'm representing the united states
so in a sense, we're competitors
not a question of friend or enemy
he's not my enemy
and hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend
it could happen
but i   i just don't know him very well
i've met him a couple of times
and when i did meet him, most of you people were there
yes
well, brexit is a   you know, i've been reading a lot about brexit over the last couple of days, and it seems to be turning a little bit differently where they're getting at least partially involved back with the european union
i have no message
it's not for me to say
i own a lot of property there
i'm going to scotland while i wait for the meeting
i have turnberry in scotland, which is a magical place   one of my favorite places
i'm going there for two days while i wait for the monday meeting
but it's not for me to say what they should be doing in the uk
i have great friendships
my mother was born in scotland
i have great friendships over there
we have a wonderful ambassador   woody johnson
and he's doing   by the way, woody is doing a great job
but it's not for me to say
i'd like to see him be able to work it so it could go quickly, whatever they work out
is it heartbreaking
oh, hard brexit
i see
i thought you said it was heartbreaking
i said, that might be going a little bit too far, right
heartbreak
is it heartbreaking
a lot of things are heartbreaking
no, i would say that brexit is brexit
it's not like   i guess we'll use the term hard brexit
i assume that's what you mean
the people voted to break it up, so i would imagine that's what they'll do
but maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route
so i don't know if that's what they voted for
i just want the people to be happy
they're great people
and i do think i have   i'm sure there will be protests, because there are always protests
but i think   there were protests the night of the election, both ways
but in the end, we got 206 electoral   306 electoral votes
and one state said   you know, it was interesting, one of the states we won, wisconsin   i didn't even realize this until fairly recently   that was the one state ronald reagan didn't win when he ran the board his second time
he didn't win wisconsin, and we won wisconsin
so, you know, we had a great night
protests
there might be protests
but i believe that the people in the uk   scotland, ireland
as you know, i have property in ireland
i have property all over
i think that those people, they like me a lot, and they agree with me on immigration
and i think that's why you have brexit in the first place, because of immigration
yes, ma'am
yeah, go ahead
well, i can't tell you what would be the ultimate
what would be the ultimate
well, let's see
no more nuclear weapons anywhere in the world would be the ultimate, okay
no more wars, no more problems, no more conflict
let's find a cure to every disease known to mankind, or womankind
that would be my ultimate, okay
and we'll start from there
okay
yeah, go ahead
he's here right now
he's here right now
yes
ghani
i agree with that
i very much agree
it's been going on for a long time
we've made a lot of progress, but it's been going on for a long time
we've made a lot of progress in afghanistan, i will say
yes, your president is here right now
in fact, he's in the room
when i'm finished with this, i'm going right back into that room
no, i think that james comey was [unfair to the people of this country
i think what he did was a disgrace
i think he goes down as the worst fbi director in history, by far
there's nobody close
and i think i did the country a tremendous favor by firing him
no, i think   actually, if you take a look, when he totally exonerated her   because i call it comey three
you had one, two, and then you had comey three
he totally exonerated her
and if anything he's saying is correct, what she did is they tried to pretend it didn't happen
i would have gone out there and i would have had the greatest news conference in history
they tried to pretend the exoneration didn't happen
now, the exoneration was incorrect because there's no way they could have checked that number of emails in just a few days
but if you remember, just before the election, he went out and he exonerated her and they didn't even talk about it
that was the greatest political mistake
with all of that being said, i won wisconsin, i won michigan, i won states that a republican hasn't won in many, many decades, years
she didn't do a good job and you never gave me credit for doing a great job
but the fact is, i did a great job
well, i hope that's not so
and i know they're getting documents
and i purposely   look, if you see what i've done with north korea and with the state department, mike pompeo, it's running so well
it's   i have this running so well
i have purposefully, because of this ridiculous witch hunt, i have said i'm going to stay away from the justice department until it's completed
so i wanted to stay away
now, that doesn't mean i have to, because i don't have to
i can get involved
but i don't want you people to say that i'm interfering, that i'm doing anything
i think that the report yesterday, maybe more importantly than anything, it totally exonerates me
there was no collusion
there was no obstruction
and if you read the report, you'll see that
what you'll really
excuse me
wait, wait, wait
what you'll really see is you'll see bias against me and millions and tens of millions of my followers
that is really a disgrace
and yet, if you go   and yet, if you look at the fbi, and you went in and you called the fbi   the real fbi   those guys love me, and i love them
no, but i think that whole investigation now is   look, the problem with the mueller investigation is everybody has got massive conflicts
you have weissmann who was at hillary clinton's funeral, meaning, her party that turned into a funeral
and they were screaming and crying and they were going crazy
how can you have people like this
so you have   i call them the 13 angry democrats
you have a tremendous animosity
now, here's the good news
i did nothing wrong
there was no collusion
there was no obstruction
the ig report yesterday went a long way to show that
and i think that the mueller investigation has been totally discredited
yeah
you know why
because i don't want to see a nuclear weapon destroy you or your family
i don't want to see
excuse me
because i don't want to see a nuclear weapon destroy you and your family
i want to have a good relationship with north korea
i want to have a good relationship with many other countries
and what i've done, if you remember, if you're fair, which most of you aren't   but if you're fair, when i came in, people thought we were probably going to war with north korea
if we did
quiet
quiet
quiet
if we did, millions of people would have been killed
i don't mean like   you know, people are saying 100,000
seoul has 28 million people 30 miles off the border
you would have had 30, 40, 50 million people killed
who knows what would have happened
i came in
that was what i inherited
i should have never inherited
that should have been solved long before i got there
i did a great job this week
the fake news said, oh, you met
but the only thing they saw that i gave up   one broadcast said, he gave up so much
you know what i gave up
i met
i met
we had great chemistry
he gave us a lot
you haven't had a missile test in seven months
you haven't had a firing
you haven't had a nuclear test in eight and a half months
you haven't had missiles flying over japan
he gave us the remains of our great heroes
i have had so many people begging me   parents, and fathers, mothers, daughters, sons   wherever i went, could you please get the remains of my boy back
they're giving them back
nobody thought that was possible
wait, wait
they're doing so much
and now we're well on our way to denuclearization
and the agreement says there will be total denuclearization
nobody wants to report that
so the only thing i did was i met
i got along with him great
he is great
we have a great chemistry together
that's a good thing, not a bad thing
i can't speak to that
i can only speak to the fact that we signed an incredible agreement
it's great
and it's going to be great for them, too
because now north korea can develop and north korea can become a great country economically
it can become whatever they want
but there won't be nuclear weapons and they won't be aimed at you and your families
that was my offer
just so you understand
military
okay, you want to hear
okay
military   i call them war games
i hated them from the day i came in
i said, why aren't we being reimbursed
that's my term
they might use it
we pay for it
we pay millions and millions of dollars for planes, and all of this
it's my term
i said, i'd like to halt it because it's bad to be negotiating and doing it
it costs us a lot of money
i saved lot of money
that's a good thing for us
okay, go ahead
i'm kidding
you don't understand sarcasm
who are you with
wait, wait, who are you with
who are you with
you're with cnn
hey, you are the worst
wait, wait, we have time
well, i feel badly about a lot of them, because i think a lot of it is very unfair
i mean, i look at some of them where they go back 12 years
like manafort has nothing to do with our campaign
but i feel so   i tell you, i feel a little badly about it
they went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago
you know, paul manafort worked for me for a very short period of time
he worked for ronald reagan
he worked for bob dole
he worked for john mccain, or his firm did
he worked for many other republicans
he worked for me, what, for 49 days or something
a very short period of time
i feel badly for some people, because they've gone back 12 years to find things about somebody, and i don't think it's right
i don't think it's right that they burst into a lawyer's office on a weekend and early in the morning
i never heard of that before
i mean, could you imagine if they burst into barack obama's lawyer's office
it would not be acceptable
it would not be acceptable
i mean, that's really a terrible thing
now, i feel badly for a lot of those people
i feel badly for general flynn
he's lost his house
he's lost his life
and some people say he lied, and some people say he didn't lie
i mean, really, it turned out maybe he didn't lie
so how can you do that
how can you do that   because who has lied more than comey
i mean, comey lied a tremendous amount
i don't want to talk about that
no, i don't want to talk about that
they'll
but look, i do want to see people treated fairly
that's what it's all about
i mentioned the other day   you saw what i did with the woman   she's in jail for 23 years on charges where other people are out after three months
i thought it was a very unfair
it was brought to   and she had another 20 years left, okay
she was 63 years old
what
well, i'm looking at them too, if you don't mind
i'm looking at them too
one second
look, i did nothing wrong
you have to understand, this stuff would have come out a long time ago
i did nothing wrong
i don't do anything wrong
it's really nice
i always liked michael cohen
i haven't spoken to michael in a long time
no, he's not my lawyer anymore
but i always liked michael, and he's a good person
and i think he's been
excuse me, do you mind if i talk
you're asking me a question
i'm trying to ask it
no, i'm not worried because i did nothing wrong
nothing wrong
let's not talk about it
you know what that is
it's irrelevant
it's a statement to the new york times   the phony, failing new york times
just wait a minute
wait a minute
that's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges
that's a statement to the phony new york times
in fact, frankly, he shouldn't even speak to the new york times because they only write phony stories anyway, although yesterday they wrote a nice story about what a
look, if you read the ig report, i've been totally exonerated
as far as i'm concerned
take a little at it
take   no, take a look at the investigation
take a look at how it started
take a look at the horrible statements that peter strzok, the chief investigator, said
and take a look at what he did with hillary clinton
take a look at
i'll tell you what   you're asking me about peter strzok being fired
i am amazed that peter strzok is still at the fbi, and so is everybody else that read that report
and i'm not even talking about the report
i'm talking about long before the report
peter strzok should have been fired a long time ago, and others should have been fired
i'm looking at scott, and scott has done a fantastic job at epa, but   you know, we'll   we'll make
i'm not happy about certain things, i'll be honest
excuse me
excuse me
i'm not happy about certain things
but he's done a fantastic job running the epa, which is very overriding
but i am not happy about it
i hope not
no, i hate it
i hate the children being taken away
the democrats have to change their law
that's their law
they will force
quiet
quiet
that's the democrats' law
we can change it tonight
we can change it right now
i will leave here
i will leave here   no, no
you need their votes
you need their votes
the democrats, all they have to do
excuse me
by one vote
we don't need it
you need 60 votes
excuse me
we have the one vote   excuse me
we need a one-vote   we have a one-vote edge
we need 60
so we need 10 votes
we can't get them from the democrats
now, wait
wait
you can't do it through an executive order
can we do one question at a time
wait
one question at a time
the children can be taken care of quickly, beautifully, and immediately
the democrats forced that law upon our nation
i hate it
i hate to see separation of parents and children
the democrats can come to us as they actually are   in all fairness, we are talking to them   and they can change the whole border security
we need a wall
we need border security
we got to get rid of catch-and-release
you catch a criminal, you take his name, you release him, and he never shows up again
he goes into our society, and then we end up getting him in a different way, oftentimes after he's killed somebody
we've got to change our laws
the democrats have control because we don't have the votes
the republicans need   we need more republicans, frankly
and that's why i think we're going to do so well in the midterms
that and because
wait
that and because we have the strongest economy in the history of our nation
we have the best jobs numbers in the last 44 years
top of drudge
the best job numbers in 44 years
because he's following the law
he's following laws
he following a law that
can i answer your question, please
okay
you're just asking me the same question over and over
he's following laws, very simply, that were given to us and forced upon us by the democrats
the democrats gave us the laws
now, i want the laws to be beautiful, humane, but strong
i don't want bad people coming in
i don't want drugs coming in
and we can solve that problem in one meeting
tell the democrats, your friends, to call me
well, i'm going to speak to people in north korea, and i'm going to speak to my people who are over in north korea
a lot of things are happening
and i will tell you this
we now have a very good relationship with north korea
when i came into this job, it looked like war   not because of me, but because   if you remember the sit-down with barack obama, i think you will admit this, he said the biggest problem that the united states has, and by far the most dangerous problem   and he said to me   that we've ever had, because of nuclear, is north korea
now, that was shortly before i entered office
i have solved that problem
now, we're getting it memorialized and all, but that problem is largely solved, and part of the reason is we signed, number one, a very good document
but you know what
more importantly than the document   more importantly than the document, i have a good relationship with kim jong un
that's a very important thing
donald trump
people are shocked that this is the kind of   you know, they thought trump was going to get in and he was going to start throwing bombs all over the place
it's actually the opposite
but we're building a military so strong   $716 billion next year
$700  this year
we're building a military so strong, nobody is going to mess with us
but you know what
i never want to have to use it
quiet
well, thank you very much, everybody
we appreciate it
we're getting ready to go back
we had a tremendous 24 hours
we've had a tremendous three months, actually, because this has been going on for quite a while
that was a tape that we gave to chairman kim and his people, his representatives
and it captures a lot
it captures what could be done
and that's a great   a great place
it has the potential to be an incredible place
between south korea   if you think about it   and china, it's got tremendous potential
and i think he understands that and he wants to do what's right
it's my honor today to address the people of the world, following this very historic summit with chairman kim jong un of north korea
we spent very intensive hours together, and i think most of you have gotten the signed document, or you will very shortly
it's very comprehensive
it's going to happen
i stand before you as an emissary of the american people to deliver a message of hope and vision, and a message of peace
let me begin by thanking our incredible hosts in singapore, especially prime minister lee, a friend of mine
this is a country of profound grace and beauty, and we send our warmest wishes to every citizen of singapore, who really made this visit so important and so pleasant, despite all of the work and all of the long hours
i also want to thank president moon of south korea
he's working hard
in fact, i'll be speaking to him right after we're finished
prime minister abe of japan   a friend of mine   just left our country, and he wants what's right for japan and for the world
he's a good man
and a very special person, president xi of china, who has really closed up that border   maybe a little bit less so over the last couple of months, but that's okay
but he really has
and he's a terrific person and a friend of mine, and really a great leader of his people
i want to thank them for their efforts to help us get to this very historic day
most importantly, i want to thank chairman kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people
our unprecedented meeting   the first between an american president and a leader of north korea   proves that real change is indeed possible
my meeting with chairman kim was honest, direct, and productive
we got to know each other well in a very confined period of time, under very strong, strong circumstance
we're prepared to start a new history and we're ready to write a new chapter between our nations
nearly 70 years ago   think of that
70 years ago   an extremely bloody conflict ravaged the korean peninsula
countless people died in the conflict, including tens of thousands of brave americans
yet, while the armistice was agreed to, the war never ended
to this day, never ended
but now we can all have hope that it will soon end
and it will
it will soon end
the past does not have to define the future
yesterday's conflict does not have to be tomorrow's war
and as history has proven over and over again, adversaries can indeed become friends
we can honor the sacrifice of our forefathers by replacing the horrors of battle with the blessings of peace
and that's what we're doing and that's what we have done
there is no limit to what north korea can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce and engagement with the rest of the world   that really wants to engage
chairman kim has before him an opportunity like no other
to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people
chairman kim and i just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula
we also agreed to vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible
and he wants to do that
this isn't the past
this isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done
chairman kim has told me that north korea is already destroying a major missile engine testing site
that's not in your signed document
we agreed to that after the agreement was signed
that's a big thing   for the missiles that they were testing, the site is going to be destroyed very soon
today is the beginning of an arduous process
our eyes are wide open, but peace is always worth the effort, especially in this case
this should have been done years ago
this should have been resolved a long time ago, but we're resolving it now
chairman kim has the chance to seize an incredible future for his people
anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace
the current state of affairs cannot endure forever
the people of korea   north and south   are profoundly talented, industrious, and gifted
these are truly gifted people
they share the same heritage, language, customs, culture, and destiny
but to realize their amazing destiny, to reunite their national family, the menace of nuclear weapons will now be removed
in the meantime, the sanctions will remain in effect
we dream of a future where all koreans can live together in harmony, where families are reunited and hopes are reborn, and where the light of peace chases away the darkness of war
this bright future is within   and this is what's happening
it is right there
it's within our reach
it's going to be there
it's going to happen
people thought this could never take place
it is now taking place
it's a very great day
it's a very great moment in the history of the world
and chairman kim is on his way back to north korea
and i know for a fact, as soon as he arrives, he's going to start a process that's going to make a lot of people very happy and very safe
so it's an honor to be with everybody today
the media   this is a big gathering of media, i will say
it makes me feel very uncomfortable
but it is what it is
people understand that this is something very important to all of us, including yourselves and your families
so thank you very much for being here
we'll take some questions
wow
that's a lot of questions
go ahead
sure, go ahead
nbc
well, he is very talented
anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough   i don't say he was nice or i don't say anything about it   he ran it
very few people, at that age   you can take one out of ten thousand, probably, couldn't do it
otto warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life
his parents are good friends of mine
i think, without otto, this would not have happened
something happened, from that day
it was a terrible thing
it was brutal
but a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including north korea
i really think that otto is someone who did not die in vain
i told this to his parents
special young man
and i have to say, special parents, special people
otto did not die in vain
he had a lot to do with us being here today
okay
thank you very much
go ahead
no, we're not reducing anything
we're not reducing
at some point, i have to be honest   and i used to say this during my campaign, as you know, probably, better than most   i want to get our soldiers out
i want to bring our soldiers back home
we have, right now, 32,000 soldiers in south korea, and i'd like to be able to bring them back home
but that's not part of the equation right now
at some point, i hope it will be, but not right now
we will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should
but we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money
plus, i think it's very provocative
yes, john
yes, john, go ahead
oh, go ahead
i'm sorry, i thought you were john roberts
i looked at you, you just like
much better, right
yes
yeah
no, not at all
because if you look at it, i mean, it said we are going to   let's see here   it will be gone
i don't think you can be anymore plain than what we're asking   issues related to the establishment of the new u
dprk relations   the building
we talk about the guarantees, and we talk about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula
this is the document that we just signed
yes, we did
yes, we did
and we'll be verifying
yeah, we'll be verifying
it will be verified
well, it's going to be achieved by having a lot of people there, and as we develop a certain trust
and we think we have done that
secretary pompeo has been really doing a fantastic job   his staff, everybody
as we do that, we're going to have a lot of people there, and we're going to be working with them on a lot of other things
but this is complete denuclearization of north korea, and it will be verified
uh, combinations of both
combinations of both
and we have talked about it, yes
yeah, go ahead
be nice
be respectful
yeah, i mean, very fair question
he actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past, and, ultimately, as you know, nothing got done
in one case, they took billions of dollars   during the clinton regime   took billions of dollars and nothing happened
that was a terrible thing, and he actually brought it up to me
and he said we have never gone this far
i don't think they've ever had the confidence, frankly, in a president that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done
and he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this
i think he might want to do this as much or even more than me because they see a very bright future for north korea
so you never know
right
we never know
but i'll tell you what, we signed a very comprehensive document today, and i think most of you have been given that document
but we signed a very, very comprehensive document, and i believe he's going to live up to that document
in fact, when he lands   which is going to be shortly   i think that he will start that process right away
i do
i do
i can only say that i know him for   really well, it's been very rhetorical, as you know
i think, without the rhetoric, it wouldn't have happened
i think without other things going along   i think the establishment of a new team was very important
we have a great team
but i do, i think he wants to get it done
i really feel that very strongly
oh, there's john
i think   you know, you two guys look alike when the light is right on the   the hair is very similar
let me see, who has better hair
he's got pretty good hair, john, i hate to
yes
yes, it was discussed
it will be discussed more in the future   human rights
what was also discussed in great detail, john, was that fact that, you know, we have   and i must have had just countless calls and letters and tweets, anything you can do   they want the remains of their sons back
they want the remains of their fathers, and mothers, and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in north korea
and i asked for it today, and we got it
that was a very last minute
the remains will be coming back
they're going to start that process immediately
but so many people, even during the campaign, they'd say, is there any way you can work with north korea to get the remains of my son back or my father back
so many people asked me this question
and, you know, i said, look, we don't get along too well with that particular group of people
but now we do
and he agreed to that so quickly and so nice   it was really a very nice thing, and he understands it
he understands it
so for the thousands and thousands   i guess way over 6,000 that we know of, in terms of the remains, they'll be brought back
especially to a lot of people that are
right
it was discussed
it was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization
well, obviously, that's where we started and where we ended
but they will be doing things, and i think he wants to do things
i think he wants to   you'd be very surprised
very smart
very good negotiator
wants to do the right thing
you know, he brought up the fact that, in the past, they took dialogue far   they never went   they never were like we are
there's never been anything like what's taken place now
but they went down the line
billions of dollars were given, and you know, the following day the nuclear program continued
but this is a much different time, and this is a much different president, in all fairness
this is very important to me
this is one of the   perhaps, one of the reasons that i   one, i campaigned on this issue, as you know very well, john
okay
whoever those people are
i cannot see you with all the lights, but you don't look like either of the two
yeah, go ahead
sure
go ahead
thank you very much
appreciate it
well, at a certain time, i will
i said that will be a day that i look very much forward to, at the appropriate time
and i also will be inviting chairman kim, at the appropriate time, to the white house
i think it's really going to be something that will be very important
and he has accepted
i said, at the appropriate time
we want to go a little bit further down the road
but what we signed today was a lot of things included
and then you have things that weren't included that we got after the deal was signed
i've done that before in my life
we didn't put it in the agreement because we didn't have time
and i think most of you have been handed out the agreement or soon will
but i
oh, you have not
okay
well, if you could have those agreements passed out
we just finished them, just a little while ago
but if you could have the agreements passed out, we'll   you'll see what we're talking about
yes, sir
go ahead
thank you
yes
yes
that's true
fifty-thousand great troops
that's true
yeah, it did   abduction
absolutely
this is prime minister abe's   one of his, certainly   other than the whole denuking subject   certainly his, i would say, his main point
and i brought it up
absolutely
and they're going to be working on that
it will be   we didn't put it down in the document, but it will be worked on
christians, yes
we are   brought it up very strongly
you know, franklin graham spent   spent and spends a tremendous amount of time in north korea
he's got it very close to his heart
it did come up, and things will be happening
okay
thank you
great question
yes, jon
go ahead
thank you, jon
right
jon, i believe it's a rough situation over there
there's no question about it
and we did discuss it today pretty strongly
i mean, knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is
denuking
but discussed it at pretty good length
we'll be doing something on it
it's rough
it's rough in a lot of places, by the way
not just there
but it's rough, and we will continue that
and i think, ultimately, we'll agree to something
but it was discussed at length outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics
i think it will change
yeah
i think it probably has to, but i think it will
yeah
thank you
thank you very much
steve
that's you, steve
right there
well, you know, scientifically, i've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization
it takes a long time
scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen
but…
having sat down with kim jong un
and does he have to change that
jon, i believe it's a rough situation over there
there's no question about it
and we did discuss it today pretty strongly
i mean, knowing what   the main purpose of what we were doing is
denuking
but discussed at pretty good length
we'll be doing something on it
it's rough
it's rough in a lot of places, by the way   not just there
but it's rough
and we will continue that, and i think, ultimately, we'll agree to something
but it was discussed at length
outside of   outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics
i think it will change, yeah
i think it probably has to
but i think it will
yeah
thank you
thank you very much
steve
that's you, steve
right there
well, you know, scientifically, i've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization
it takes a long time
scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen
but despite that, once you start the process, it means it's pretty much over
you can't use them
that's the good news
and that's going to start very   very soon
i believe that's going to start very soon
we will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done, steve
the sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor
sanctions played a big role, but they'll come off at that point
i hope it's going to be soon, but they'll come off
as you know, and as i've said, the sanctions right now remain
but at a certain point, i actually look forward to taking them off
and they'll come off when we know we're down the road   where it's not going to happen, nothing is going to happen
okay
yes, go ahead
please
thank you
thank you very much
congratulations to everybody, by the way
congratulations to everybody
go ahead
well, you have a different administration
you have a different president
you have a different secretary of state
you have people that are   you know, it's very important to them
and we get it done
the other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority
i don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly
i don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority
and it would have been easier back then
it would have been   for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago
and i'm not just blaming president obama
i mean, this goes back   for 25 years, this should have happened
i was given a very tough hand
i was given this, i was given the iran deal, and plenty of other problems
but we are   we're doing really well
and the iran deal, i have to be honest, i did it because nuclear is always number one to me
nuclear is number one
but on the iran deal, i think iran is a different country now than it was three or four months ago
i don't think they're looking so much to the mediterranean
i don't think they're looking so much at syria, like they were, with total confidence
i don't think they're so confident right now
but i hope   with that being said, i hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in   and they are brutal, what we've put on iran   i hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because i'd love to be able to do that
but right now, it's too soon for that
yes, please
good question
hopefully soon
but we'll have to get things moving first
very   a little bit early for that
we have to get things moving
yes, go ahead
yeah, we've done exercises for a long period of time, working with south korea
and we call them war games, and i call them war games
and they're tremendously expensive
the amount of money that we spend on that is incredible
and south korea contributes, but not 100 percent, which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also
and that has to do with the military expense and also the trade
so we're doing that
we actually have a new deal with south korea, in terms of the trade deal, but we have to talk to them
we have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly
but the war games are very expensive
we pay for a big majority of them
we fly in bombers from guam
i said   when i first started, i said, where do the bombers come from
guam
nearby
i said, oh, great, nearby
where's nearby
six and a half hours
six and a half hours   that's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to south korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place, and then go back to guam
i know a lot about airplanes
it's very expensive
and i didn't like it
and what i did say is   and i think it's very provocative, i have to tell you, jennifer, it's a very provocative situation when i see that, and you have a country right next door
so under the circumstances that we are negotiating a very comprehensive, complete deal, i think it's inappropriate to be having war games
so, number one, we save money   a lot
and number two, it really is something that i think they very much appreciate it
well, we've gotten   you know, i've heard that
i mean, some of the people that   i don't know, maybe they really mean it
i don't always want to go against the press because i just don't   especially not today, this is too important
but i noticed that some of the people were saying that the president has agreed to meet, he has given up so much
i gave up nothing
i'm here
i haven't slept in 25 hours, but i thought it was appropriate to do   because we have been negotiating for literally around the clock with them, and with us, and with john, and with mike, and a whole team of very talented people
but we haven't given up anything, other than   you're right, i agreed to meet
and i think the meeting was every bit as good for the united states as it was for north korea
but i just wrote down some of the things we got
and they   you know, they   sure, they got a meeting
but only a person that dislikes donald trump would say that i've agreed to make a big commitment
sure, i've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet, and that's good
but i think it's great for us, as a country, and i think it's good for them
but what did they do to justify this meeting
secured commitment for complete denuclearization
that's the big thing
they secured the release of three american hostages
they already gave them to us two months ago
these people are now living happily back in their homes, with their families
and it was pretty rough for them, to put it mildly
secure the commitment to recover the remains, including   these are of fallen heroes
and they're giving a commitment, they're starting it immediately, to recover their remains
and i just went through how many people asked me about it
i was amazed, actually
so many people would ask me, is it possible
is it possible
at that time we had no relationship to chairman kim or to anybody else in north korea
you know, it was a very closed society
so we're getting the remains back
secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for   how long has it been
seven months
you haven't had a missile go up
for seven months, you haven't had a nuclear test
you haven't had a nuclear explosion
i remember a nuclear event took place   8
8 in the richter scale
and they announced   i heard it on the radio   they announced that a massive   you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in asia
and then they said it was in north korea
and then they found out it was a nuclear test
i said, i never heard of a richter scale in the high 8s
and if you look, there has been no missile launches
they've blown up their missile area
that's going to take place
that has not been written into the contract
we're going to give you the exact details on that
but they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests
they secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test site
all three of them   they're in an area that's common around each other   they secured the closure
they secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site
that was not in your agreement
i got that after we signed the agreement
i said, do me a favor
you've got this missile engine testing site
we know where it is because of the heat
it's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you
i said, can you close it up
he's going to close it up
we maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions
so we're applying sanctions
now i had 300 sanctions that i was getting ready to put on last week
and i said, you know, i can't really put on sanctions when i'm meeting with   i thought it would be very disrespectful
three hundred very big ones, powerful ones
and i said it would be disrespectful
so, jennifer, when you look at all of those things that we got   and when we got our hostages back, i didn't pay $1
8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from iran, which was a disgraceful situation, what took place
so we've gotten a lot
so when i hear somebody in the media say that president trump has agreed to meet   like, it's not a big deal to meet
i think we should meet on a lot of different topics, not just this one
and i really believe a lot of great things can happen
yes
go ahead, please
well, thank you very much
i appreciate it
we're getting ready to make a big trip
we're just leaving, but we wanted to have a little bit of a conference just to announce what's happened, how we've done
and i think it's been very, very successful
we've concluded a really tremendously successful g7 and would like to provide you with an update
and you know the gentlemen up are the legendary larry kudlow and the legendary john bolton
and we had a good meeting, both on defense and environment and, frankly, on tariffs, which are what we're here for
first, i'd like to thank prime minister trudeau for hosting this summit
it has worked out to be so wonderful
the people of canada are wonderful, and it's a great country, and a very beautiful country, i might add
we tackled a variety of issues and opportunities facing our nations
at the top of the list was the issue of trade   a very important subject   because the united states has been taken advantage of for decades and decades, and we can't do that anymore
we had extremely productive discussions on the need to have fair and reciprocal   meaning, the same
people can't charge us 270 percent and we charge them nothing
that doesn't work anymore
i made a lot of statements having to do with clarity
we want and expect other nations to provide fair market access to american exports, and that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect american industry and workers from unfair foreign trading practices, of which, really, there are many
but we're getting them straightened out, slowly but surely
we also discussed the issue of uncontrolled migration and the threat that it poses to both national security and other groups and countries, and our citizens and quality of life
we're committed to addressing the migration challenge by helping migrants to remain and prosper in their own home countries
a wide array of national security threats were addressed, including the threat of iran
the g7 nations remain committed to controlling iran's nuclear ambitions   with or without them, those ambitions are going to be controlled   along with efforts to combat terrorism and extremism and those who spread this deadly ideology
the nations of the g7 are bound together by shared values and beliefs
that came out loud and clear
each of our nations is totally unique with our people and our own sovereign obligations
but we can coordinate together and achieve a common good   a good for all   good for all of our people, all of our nations
we're linked in the great effort to create a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world
and from the standpoint of trade and jobs and being fair to companies, we are really, i think, committed
i think they are starting to be committed to a much more fair trade situation for the united states, because it has been treated very, very unfairly
and i don't blame other leaders for that
i blame our past leaders
there was no reason that this should have happened
last year, they lost eight-hundred   we as a nation, over the years   but the latest number is $817 billion on trade
that's ridiculous and it's unacceptable
and everybody was told that
so i don't blame them
i blame our leaders
in fact, i congratulate the leaders of other countries for so crazily being able to make these trade deals that were so good for their country and so bad for the united states
but those days are over
in just a few minutes, i'll be leaving for singapore
i'll be on a mission of peace, and we will carry in, really   in my heart, we're going to be carrying the hearts of millions of people, people from all over the world
we have to get denuclearization
we have to get something going
we really think that north korea will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time
and we appreciate everything that's going on
we appreciate the working together with north korea
they're really working very well with us
so i say   so far, so good
we're going to have to see what happens
and we're going to know very soon
so i'll be leaving   as soon as we're finished with this conference, i'll be leaving
and i very much look forward to it
i think it's very important for north korea and south korea and japan, and the world, and the united states
it's a great thing
and we'll see what happens
okay
any questions
yes, yes
well, there's always everything
it's really   you know, this has probably rarely been done
it's unknown territory, in the truest sense
but i really feel confident
i feel that kim jong un wants to do something great for his people, and he has that opportunity
and he won't have that opportunity again
it's never going to be there again
so i really believe that he's going to do something very positive for his people, for himself, his family
he's got an opportunity, the likes of which i think almost   if you look into history   very few people have ever had
he can take that nation, with those great people, and truly make it great
so it's a one-time   it's a one-time shot
and i think it's going to work out very well
that's why i feel positive, because it makes so much sense
and we will watch over, and we'll protect, and we'll do a lot of things
i can say that south korea, japan, china, many countries want to see it happen
and they'll help
they'll all help
so there's a great   there's really   this is a great time
this has not happened in all of the years that they've been separated by a very artificial boundary
this is a great opportunity for peace, and lasting peace, and prosperity
yes, ma'am
yeah, i have not spoken to vladimir putin in quite a while
it has been discussed
we didn't do votes or anything, but it has been discussed
some people like the idea of bringing russia back in
this used to be the g8, not the g7
and something happened a while ago, where russia is no longer in
i think it would be an asset to have russia back in
i think it would be good for the world
i think it would be good for russia
i think it would be good for the united states
i think it would be good for all of the countries of the current g7
i think the g8 would be better
i think having russia back in would be a positive thing
we're looking for peace in the world
we're not looking to play games
okay
question
yes
i did
oh, i did
that's the way it should be
no tariffs, no barriers
that's the way it should be
and no subsidies
i even said no tariffs
in other words, let's say canada   where we have tremendous tariffs   the united states pays tremendous tariffs on dairy
as an example, 270 percent
nobody knows that
we pay nothing
we don't want to pay anything
why should we pay
we have to   ultimately, that's what you want
you want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair
so you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free
that's the way you learned at the wharton school of finance
i mean, that would be the ultimate thing
now, whether or not that works   but i did suggest it, and people were   i guess, they got to go back to the drawing and check it out, right
but we can't have   an example   where we're paying   the united states is paying 270 percent
just can't have it
and when they send things into us, you don't have that
i will say, it was not contentious
what was strong was the language that this cannot go on
but the relationships are very good, whether it be president macron or with justin
we had   justin did a really good job
i think the relationships were outstanding
but because of the fact that the united states leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade   and again, i'm not blaming countries
i'm blaming our people that represented our past
it's got to change
it's going to change
i mean, it's not a question of i hope it changes
it's going to change, a hundred percent
and tariffs are going to come way down, because people cannot continue to do that
we're like the piggybank that everybody is robbing
and that ends
in fact, larry kudlow is a great expert on this, and he's a total free trader
but even larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs
would you like to say something, larry, very quickly
it might be interesting
thank you
and it's very unfair to our farmers
our farmers are, essentially   whether it's through a barrier, non-monetary barrier, or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible   and this is all over the world
this isn't just g7
i mean, we have india, where some of the tariffs are 100 percent
a hundred percent
and we charge nothing
we can't do that
and so we are talking to many countries
we're talking to all countries
and it's going to stop
or we'll stop trading with them
and that's a very profitable answer, if we have to do it
yes, sir
well, if they retaliate, they're making a mistake
because, you see, we have a tremendous trade imbalance
so when we try and bring our piece up a little bit so that it's not so bad, and then they go up   right   the difference is they do so much more business with us than we do with them that we can't lose that
you understand
we can't lose it
and as an example, with one country we have $375 billion in trade deficits
we can't lose
you could make the case that they lost years ago
but when you're down $375 billion, you can't lose
and we have to bring them up
so there's very bad spirit
when we have a big trade imbalance and we want to bring it up to balance   just balance   and they keep raising it so that you never catch, that's not a good thing to do
and we have very, very strong measures that take care of that, because we do so much
the numbers are so astronomically against them in terms of anything, as per your question
we win that war a thousand times out of a thousand
yes
yes, sir
so two things can happen on nafta
we'll either leave it the way it is, as a threesome deal with canada and with the united states and mexico, and change it very substantially   we're talking about very big changes
or we're going to make a deal directly with canada and directly with mexico
both of those things could happen
if a deal isn't made, that would be a very bad thing for canada and it would be a very bad thing for mexico
for the united states, frankly, it would be a good thing
but i'm not looking to do that
i'm not looking to play that game
so we're either going to have nafta in a better negotiated form, or we're going to have two deals
it will have a sunset
you have the two sunsets
i mean, you have an isds provision and a sunset provision
they've been very heavily negotiated
you have two sunsets, two concepts of sunset
we're pretty close on the sunset provision
okay
well, we have one that's five years
you know it very well
you've studied this very well
congratulations
that's right
you have one group that likes to have five years, and then a renegotiation at the end of five years
and you have another group that wants longer because of the investments
but we're pretty close
yes, sir
well, you know, you have to ask president obama, because he was the one that let crimea get away
that was during his administration
and he was the one that let russia go and spend a lot of money on crimea, because they've spent a lot of money on rebuilding it
i guess they have their submarine port there and such
but crimea was let go during the obama administration
and, you know, obama can say all he wants, but he allowed russia to take crimea
i may have had a much different attitude
so you'd really have to ask that question to president obama   you know, why did he do that
why did he do that
but with that being said, it's been done a long time
i would rather see russia in the g8 as opposed to the g7
i would say that the g8 is a more meaningful group than the g7, absolutely
yes
yes, ma'am
they virtually didn't even make that case
i mean, my case is the fact that it is national security
it's our balance sheet
it's our strength
it's absolutely national security
and, you know, if you look at our   just take a look at our balance sheet
we're going to have a very strong balance sheet very soon because of what we're doing
we have the strongest economy that we've ever had in the united states   in the history of the united states
we have the best unemployment numbers
black unemployment, the lowest in history
hispanic unemployment, the lowest in history
i don't mean the lowest in the last 10 years or 20 years
the lowest in the history of this country
black unemployment is doing the best it's ever done
hispanic doing the best
women are now up to 21 years
soon it's going to be the best ever in its history   in the country's history
we have to have deals that are fair, and we have to have deals that are economic
otherwise, that does, in fact, affect our military
okay
oh, it's very easy
it's economic
it's the balance sheet
to have a great military, you need a great balance sheet
yes, sir
go ahead
it's well put, i think
who are you with, out of curiosity
i figured
fake news cnn
the worst
but i could tell by the question
i had no idea you were cnn
after the question, i was just curious as to who you were with
you were cnn
i would say that the level of relationship is a 10
we have a great relationship
angela and emmanuel and justin
i would say the relationship is a 10
and i don't blame them
i blame   as i said, i blame our past leaders for allowing this to happen
there was no reason this should happen
there's no reason that we should have big trade deficits with virtually every country in the world
i'm going long beyond the g7
there's no reason for this
it's the fault of the people that preceded me
and i'm not just saying president obama
i'm going back a long way
you can go back 50 years, frankly
it just got worse and worse and worse
you know, we used to be a nation that was unbelievably cash-flow-oriented
had no debt of any consequence, and that built the highway system
we built the interstate system out of   virtually out of cash flow
and it was a lot different
no, we have a very good relationship, and i don't blame these people, but i will blame them if they don't act smart and do what they have to do   because they have no choice
i'll be honest with you, they have no choice
they're either going to make the trades fair, because our farmers have been hurt
you look at our farmers
for 15 years, the graph is going just like this   down
our farmers have been hurt, our workers have been hurt
our companies have moved out and moved to mexico and other countries, including canada
now, we are going to fix that situation
and if it's not fixed, we're not going to deal with these countries
but the relationship that i've had is great
so you can tell that to your fake friends at cnn
the relationship that i've had with the people, the leaders of these countries, has been   i would really, rate it on a scale of 0 to 10, i would rate it a 10
that doesn't mean i agree with what they're doing
and they know very well that i don't
so we're negotiating very hard, tariffs and barriers
as an example, the european union is brutal to the united states
they don't   and they understand that
they know it
when i'm telling them, they're smiling at me
you know, it's like the gig is up
it's like the gig is up
they're not trying to   there's nothing they can say
they can't believe they got away with it
canada can't believe it got away with it
mexico   we have $100 billion trade deficit with mexico and that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring in because we have no wall
but we are
we started building the wall, as you know
6 billion   and we're going to keep that going
but a lot of these countries actually smile at me when i'm talking
and the smile is   we couldn't believe we got away with it
that's the smile
so it's going to change
it's going to change
they have no choice
if it's not going to change, we're not going to trade with them
okay, how about a couple of more
go ahead in the back
yes
i have a clear objective
but i have to say, eliana, that it's going to be something that will always be spur of the moment
you don't know
you know, this has not been done before at this level
this is a leader who really is an unknown personality
people don't know much about him
i think that he's going to surprise, on the upside, very much on the upside
we'll see
but never been done
never been tested
many people   world leaders   i'm talking about world leaders that have been right next to him have never met him
so we're going in with a very positive spirit
i think very well prepared
i think   and, by the way, we have worked very well with their people
they have many people right now in shanghai
our people have been   in singapore
our people have been working very, very well with the representatives of north korea
so we're going in with a very positive attitude, and i think we're going to come out fine
but i've said it many times
who knows
who knows
may not
may not work out
it's a good chance it won't work out
there's probably an even better chance that it will take a period of time
it will be a process
well, i think the minimum would be relationship
you'd start at least a dialogue
because, you know, as a deal person, i've done very well with deals
what you want to do is start that
now, i'd like to accomplish more than that
but at a minimum, i do believe, at least we'll have met each other
we will have seen each other
hopefully we will have liked each other and we'll start that process
so i would say that would be the minimal
and the maximum, i think you know the answer to that
but i think that will take a little bit of time
okay
yeah
that's a good question
how long will it take
i think within the first minute i'll know
just my touch, my feel
that's what i do
how long will it take to figure out whether or not they're serious
i said maybe in the first minute
you know, the way   they say that you know if you're going to like somebody in the first five seconds
you ever hear that one
well, i think that very quickly i'll know whether or not something good is going to happen
i also think i'll know whether or not it will happen fast
it may not
but i think i'll know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen
and if i think it won't happen, i'm not going to waste my time
i don't want to waste his time
yes, ma'am
no, no, no, no
that's only   only the fake news says that
you know, this   look, we just three hostages back
we paid nothing
they came back
they're happily in ensconced in their homes with their families
they're the happiest people in the world right now
we have gotten   you know, we haven't done anything
everyone said   you know, the haters, they say, oh, you're giving him a meeting
give me a break, okay
there's nothing
i think if i didn't do this, it would be   and it's never been done before, you know
it's never been done before
and obviously, what has been done before hasn't worked
and this is something   i can't stress this strong enough
you know, i talked about tariffs that previous people   and i'm not looking to criticize people that were preceding me   but on tariffs, it should have never happened
well, the same thing on north korea
we shouldn't be in this position
we shouldn't be in this position on tariffs
we were hundreds of billions of dollars down to other countries that, frankly, were never even negotiated with
they never even got spoken to
i asked a top person in china, how did it get so bad
he looked at me, he said, nobody ever talked to us
they were missing in action, our leaders
well, a very similar thing, if you think about it, took place with north korea
this should not be done now
this should have been done 5 years ago, and 10 years ago, and 25 years ago
it shouldn't be done now
i can't comment on that
okay, one more question
we're going to raise every issue
every issue is going to be raised
because the u
press is very dishonest, much of it
not all of it
oh, i have some folks in your profession that are with the u
, in the u
citizens, proud citizens
they're reporters
these are some of the most outstanding people i know
but there are many people in the press that are unbelievably dishonest
they don't cover stories the way they're supposed to be
they don't even report them, in many cases, if they're positive
so there's tremendous   you know, i came up with the term, fake news
it's a lot of fake news
but at the same time, i have great respect for many people in the press
thank you all very much
i appreciate it
thank you
thank you
the meeting went very well
we'll be meeting on june 12th in singapore
it went very well
it's really a get-to-know-you kind of a situation
mike has spent two days doing this
we've gotten to know their people very well
and we will   you people are going to have to travel because you'll be in singapore on june 12th
and i think it'll be a process
it's not   i never said it goes in one meeting
i think it's going to be a process
but the relationships are building, and that's a very positive thing
well, i think they want to do that
i know they want to do that
they want other things along the line
they want to develop as a country
that's going to happen
i have no doubt
japan is involved, as you know
and south korea is very much involved
we're involved in terms of getting everything
everybody wants the united states
so we're going to help in the process very much
without us, it wouldn't happen
but i think that you see a lot of very positive things, including with china
i think you see a lot of very positive things happening with president xi, who has helped me quite a bit with this
so we'll see where it leads
but we're going to be   june 12th, we'll be in singapore
it will be a beginning
i don't say and i've never said it happens in one meeting
you're talking about years of hostility
years of problems
years of, really, hatred between so many different nations
but i think you're going to have a very positive result in the end
not from one meeting, but you're going to have a very positive
my letter was a response to their letter
the media forgot that
you know, the media said, oh, you had a meeting, then you cancelled
i didn't cancel the meeting
i cancelled it in response to a very tough statement
and i think we're over that   totally over that
and now we're going to deal, and we're going to really start a process
we're meeting with the chairman on june 12th
and i think it's probably going to be a very successful   ultimately, a successful process
we'll see
remember what i say
we will see what we will see
but i think it's going to be a process that we deserve to have
i mean, we really deserve   they want it
we think it's important
and i think we would be making a big mistake if we didn't have it
i think we're going to have a relationship, and it will start on june 12th
well, this was a very good meeting
don't forget, this was a meeting where a letter was given to me by kim jong un, and that letter was a very nice letter
oh, would you like to see what was in that letter
would you like it
how much
how much
how much
ah, it was a very interesting letter
and at some point i may be   it may be appropriate, and maybe i'll be able to give it to you
maybe you'll be able to see it, and maybe fairly soon
but really, this was a letter presentation that ended up being a two-hour conversation
because we found the whole subject matter very interesting
and because i really think they want to do something
and if it's possible, so do we
i think all we're going to do is be there on june 12th, and we're going to see what happens
mike has been dealing very well
they have a very good relationship with mike pompeo, our secretary of state
it was actually very interesting because this was literally going to be the delivery of a letter, and it ended up being a two-hour conversation with the second most powerful man in north korea
we talked about almost everything
we talked about a lot
and we talked about sanctions
i don't want to say that
we talked about about a lot of things
we really did
but the big deal will be on june 12th
and again, it's a process
it doesn't go   we're not going to sign a   we're not going to go in and sign something on june 12th and we never were
we're going to start a process
and i told them today, take your time
we can go fast
we can go slowly
but i think they'd like to see something happen
and if we can work that out, that will be good
but the process will begin on june 12th in singapore
yeah, i do think so
he'd like to see it happen
he wants to be careful
he wants to be, you know   he's not going to run and do things
but i told him, to be honest with you, look, we have sanctions on
they're very powerful sanctions
we would not take sanctions off unless they did that
but the sanctions are very powerful
you've seen how powerful in other ways
you're going to see how powerful sanctions are when it comes to iran
you see what that's doing to iran
so we have sanctions on
and at a certain point, i'll tell you what, i look forward to the day when i can take the sanctions off of north korea
we did not talk about human rights, no
could be
yeah
could be
i think we probably will, and maybe in great detail
we did not talk about human rights
yeah, we did
we talked about it
yes, they asked about sanctions
excuse me
it's going to remain what it is now
i don't even want to use the term maximum pressure anymore because i don't want to use that term because we're getting along
you see the relationship
we're getting along
so it's not a question of maximum pressure
it's staying essentially the way it is
at some point, hopefully, a deal   for the good of millions of people, a deal will be worked out
well, i think they're okay
i mean, i think they're good
is it like the relationships we have with a couple of other countries
probably not
right
but i think the relationship we have right now with north korea is as good as it's been in a long time
they had no relationship under the previous administration
there was nothing
it was nothing
they were explaining, it was just a nothing
nothing was done
hey, folks, this should not be up to me
this should have been handled a long time ago
this got to a very critical point
this should have been handled many years ago   not only by president obama, but by other presidents that preceded me
this shouldn't be done now, this should have been done years ago
well, what's going to happen is south korea will do that
no, i don't think the united states is going to have to spend
i think south korea will do it
i think china   i think, frankly, china will help out
i think that japan will help out
no, i don't see the united states spending a lot of money
you know, we have three hostages
how much money did i spend for the hostages
and, look, we're very far away
we are very far away
those places are very close
it's their neighborhood
we're thousands   we're 6,000 miles away
so i've already told south korea, i said, you know, you're going to have to get ready
and japan, also
and i think they really want to see something great happen
japan does, south korea does, and i think china does
but that's their neighborhood
it's not our neighborhood
yeah, i didn't like it
i didn't like it, but it could be very positive, too
i didn't like the russian meeting yesterday
i said, what's the purpose of that
but, it could be a positive meeting
if it's a positive meeting, i love it
if it's a negative meeting, i'm not happy
and it could very well be a positive meeting
well, we could   that could happen
that could happen
we talked about it
we talked about ending the war
and you know, this war has been going on   it's got to be the longest war   almost 70 years, right
and there is a possibility of something like that
that's more of a signing of a document that it's very important in one way
historically, it's very important
but we'll see
and we did discuss that   the ending of the korean war
can you believe that we're talking about the ending of the korean war
you're talking about 70 years
well, we're going to discuss it prior to the meeting
that's something that could come out of the meeting
i think, really, there's something that maybe could come out of the meeting
i think china would like to see a very positive result
i have a lot of good relations with, as you know, chairman xi
he's a great   he's really a very wonderful guy
he's a man that loves china
however, he wants to do what's best for china
i think china and president xi would love to see something happen here
well, we're going to make sure it's secure
we're going to make sure when this is over, it's over
it's not going to be starting up again
and they have a potential to be a great country
and i think south korea is going to help a lot
japan is going to help a lot
i think china is going to help a lot
well, that's a very complicated question, frankly, but you'll see that over a period of time
i really think you can
and i think it's going to be very successful
they're incredible people
i think it's going to be a very great success
so we'll see what happens
but we'll see you   we will see you on june 12th, but i'm sure we'll see you a little bit before that
in the meantime, how is sarah doing
okay
the   which one
i told them, i think that you're going to have, probably, others
hey, wouldn't it be wonderful if we walked out and everything was settled all of a sudden from sitting down for a couple of hours
no, i don't see that happening
but i see over a period of time
and frankly, i said, take your time
take your time
it's going to remain as is, but take your time
one thing i did do, and it was very important, we had hundreds of new sanctions ready to go on
and he did not   the director did not ask, but i said i'm not going to put them on until such time as the talks break down
we have very significant sanctions on now
but we had hundreds   we have hundreds that are ready to go
but i said, i'm not going to
but why would i do that when we're talking so nicely
i think it's a getting to know you meeting, plus
and that can be a very positive thing
no, i didn't
i haven't seen the letter yet
i purposely didn't open the letter
i haven't opened it
i didn't open it in front of the director
i said, would you want me to open it
he said, you can read it later
i may be in for a big surprise, folks
so long, everybody
well, nafta   look, it's been a terrible deal for the united states
people are starting to see it
we lose over $100 billion a year with mexico
we lose many, many, many billions of dollars with canada
canada doesn't take   i mean, they're very restrictive as to taking our agricultural product, and other things
and, you know, all of these countries, including the european union, they charge five times the tariff
we don't charge tariffs, essentially
they charge five times what we charge for tariffs
and i believe in the word reciprocal
you're going to charge five times
we're going to charge five times
that hasn't been done
no other president ever brought it up
and it's going to be done now
so we're negotiating numerous deals
we're talking about nafta
to be honest with you, i wouldn't see nafta   i wouldn't mind seeing nafta, where you'd go by a different name, where you make a separate deal with canada and a separate deal with mexico because you're talking about a very different two countries
but i wouldn't mind seeing a separate deal with canada, where you have one type of product, so to speak, and a separate deal with mexico
these are two very difficult countries
it's been a lousy deal for the united states from day one
we lose a lot of money with canada, and we lose a fortune with mexico
and it's not going to happen like that anymore
i mean, mexico has taken our car companies, a big percentage of them
and we can't do that
and, look, the american worker agrees with me
obviously, the stock market agrees because when you look at what's going on with the stocks, they're starting to see i'm right
but if you take the european union and you see the kind of tariff they charge, and then we don't, that's called, not fair trade
i want fair trade
i like free trade, but i want fair trade
at a minimum, i want fair trade
and we're going to have it for our workers and for our companies
and you know what
the other side understands it
to be honest with you, they cannot believe that they've gotten away with this for so many decades
they're our allies but they take advantage of us economically
and so i agree   i love canada
i love mexico
i love them
but mexico is making over $100 billion a year and they're not helping us with our border because they have strong laws and we have horrible laws
we have horrible border laws
they have strong   they could solve our border problem if they wanted, but they don't want to
and when they want to, then i'll be happy
but i think we have a good chance of doing some great trade deals, and we'll make america great again
right
that's what we're doing
but america has picked up   we've made about $8 trillion in value since   you know, we're double the size of the economy of china
we've picked up a lot of value, a lot of wealth, since i've been president
more than $8 trillion
and that's a very low number because we're talking stock market wealth
i'm talking about beyond that
our companies are doing great, we're doing great, our military is rebuilding
we have a lot of great things going
we're going to straighten out trade
the trade is going to be easy
and other countries understand
you know, when i talk to them, they look at me   and this is in closed doors, not for you people   and they essentially say, we can't believe we've gotten away with this for so long
it's like, you guys can't believe you've gotten away with it for so long
i want everyone to watch
because i'll tell you what, we have such a great country
right now, at this level, i don't think we've ever been, on an economic scale   you look at the numbers
8 percent
we have the lowest numbers of unemployment that we've had   is it 50 years
i think it's 50
fifty years, right
so we have the best   we have some of the best economic numbers we've ever had as a nation
and that goes a long way
and we're building something very special
just remember, we're twice the size   our economy   twice the size of china
good meeting today
i think it's a great start
just a little relaxation and a lot of work
we have a lot of calls set up
i'm calling a lot of the foreign leaders
i'm negotiating trade deals
i'm working
i'm working hard for you people
have a good time
thank you
thank you very much
thank you
melania and i are truly honored to welcome french president macron and mrs
macron to the white house
thank you very much
it's a great honor
we're thrilled that the first official state visit of my presidency is not only with a great friend, but with a leader of america's oldest ally, the republic of france
today, in our nation's capital, the stars and stripes proudly fly alongside the tricolor flag, a symbol of the world, and to the world, of unity, fraternity, and friendship that forever links our nations together
forty years after the end of our war of independence, the great general lafayette traveled to george washington's home at mount vernon to visit the grave of the father of our country
president macron, we're deeply moved that nearly two centuries later, the president of the republic of france made that same tribute last night
that was a beautiful evening
thank you
thank you very much
this past summer, melania and i had an incredible visit with you and brigitte in paris to celebrate bastille day
we were awed by the beauty of your country and the grateful hospitality of your incredible people
they are incredible people
together, we commemorated the 100th anniversary of america's entry into the first world war
we remembered the french and american patriots who shed their blood together in defense of civilization
their noble sacrifice will echo through time forever, an immortal tribute to our people and to our freedom
during the horror of the first world war, more than one million people were killed or injured from chemical warfare
in the aftermath of that horror, civilized nations came together to ban chemical weapons
two weeks ago, following syrian dictator bashar al-assad's barbaric use of chemical weapons against his own people, the united states, france, and the united kingdom joined together to strike at the heart of the syrian chemical weapons program
these actions were designed to establish a strong deterrent against the use of these heinous weapons
president macron, i thank you for your leadership in this effort
and it was a well-executed effort at that
and i thank you and the members of the french military for their courage and their great skill
the united states and france are also cooperating to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons
we are grateful for france's key partnership in our campaign of maximum pressure on the north korean regime
as you know, i will soon be meeting with kim jong-un as we seek a future of peace, harmony and security for the whole korean peninsula and, in fact, for the whole world
however, in pursuit of peace, we will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations
the campaign of maximum pressure will continue
france and the united states also agree that iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon, and that regime must end its support for terrorism all over
no matter where you go in the middle east, you see the fingerprints of iran behind problems
i also want to thank president macron for france's vital contribution to our very successful campaign against isis
as we drive these isis killers from syria, it is essential that the responsible nations of the middle east step up their own contributions to prevent iran from profiting off the success of our anti-isis effort
very rich countries are in the middle east
they have to make major contributions
they have not been doing it as they should
a major topic that we discussed a little while ago
they have to step up tremendously   not a little bit, but tremendously   their financial effort
president, on behalf of the american people, i again express our solidarity in the wake of the terrorist attack in southern france last month
i share the confidence you conveyed at the memorial service for the heroic colonel beltrame that, in time, we will achieve the ultimate triumph of right and of justice
in the fight against terrorism, we both know that we must be strong from within to defend ourselves from threats outside
we will do what we must to protect our countries
you are our oldest ally and you are truly one of our great allies, and we appreciate it
we will always be there for you
both the united states and france are dealing with a challenge that has gone on for a long, long time
it's uncontrolled migration
in the united states, we are taking strong action to regain control over our borders and over our sovereignty
it's gone on for too long
and we've slowed it down very substantially, but we're going to stop illegal immigration
i know that you face similar challenges in france
and, mr
president, i admire the leadership you have shown in addressing them in a very honest and direct fashion, and not always popular
both of our elections owe much of the success to the desire of everyday citizens to be heard, to be listened to, and to have control over their own nations and their own futures
let us demonstrate through our partnership that the voice of the people will always reign
at all times, it will reign
during our meetings today, we also discussed the robust economic relationship between our countries
the united states is setting records in business, and we will continue
and i know that france will be setting records under your leadership very soon
we look forward to exploring increased opportunities for bilateral trade and investment based on the principle of fairness and, importantly, reciprocity
president, thank you again for accepting our invitation to the white house
it's been such an honor
the foundation of our friendship draws from the deepest wells of civilization and is sustained by our people's love of their history, culture, and liberty
for two centuries, the alliance between france and the united states has been the cornerstone of freedom
now, the strength of this mighty alliance is in our hands
linked together by fate and destiny, i am confident that our future has never, ever looked brighter
thank you, mr
president
thank you very much
please
i like him a lot
first of all, i want to thank   i want to thank our vice president and karen for being here
thank you very much
appreciate it
now, we had a wonderful conference today, and i think especially the one-on-one in the oval office   we covered a lot of territory having to do with trade, having to do with iran, and various other subjects
so i think a lot of good things are going to come out of our meeting, and i appreciate you being here
i will take a couple of questions
how about jeff mason from reuters
jeff
hi, jeff
well, we will start with your second part of the question
and i hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with north korea
i started a process, and when i did, everybody thought i was doing it absolutely wrong
but in the meantime, for 25 years, people have been dealing and nothing happened
and a lot is happening right now
i can tell you that, jeff
a lot is happening
and i think it's going to be very positive
and i hope it's going to be very positive for north korea and for south korea, and japan, and the rest of the world
but i am starting at a level that, frankly, i shouldn't have had to start
this should have been worked out a long time ago
this should have been worked out many years ago
we were discussing that we shouldn't be having this situation happen to the united states and the world
this should have been resolved by other presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago
with that being said, i think we're doing very well
meetings are being set up
and i want to see denuclearization of north korea
a lot of concessions have already been made
we have made no concessions, despite some of the media saying that i've made concessions
i don't   i haven't even discussed a concession other than the fact that meeting is a great thing
and i'm sure that a lot of other people would have liked to have had the position we're having
i will say this
we put the strongest sanctions on a country that we ever have put on any country, by far
china, president xi, has been very strong in helping us to solve this problem   in his case, at the border
he's allowing very little to get through
i think he's doing that for a number of reasons
we have a very good relationship, and also it's very important in terms of trade, because i do play the trade card
if you look at what's happening with trade in china, it hasn't been fair for many, many years to the united states, and we're going to solve that problem
in fact, we're having secretary mnuchin and a couple of other folks heading over to   bob lighthizer   heading over to china, at the request of china
they came here, as you know, last week
and we're having very substantive discussions on trade
but i think it all plays to the border and the fact that they have been extremely strong on the border and very little has gotten through, much to the surprise of a lot of people
and i believe the trade will work out, but i also think that china has never treated us with more respect than they have over the last short period of time that i'm president
i have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with president xi
and i think that relationship is very important as to what's happening with north korea
so the end result is, we'll see
maybe good things will happen and maybe we're all wasting a lot of time
but hopefully it will be good for everybody concerned
as far as syria is concerned, i would love to get out
i'd love to bring our incredible warriors back home
they've done a great job
we've essentially just absolutely obliterated isis in iraq and in syria
and we've done a big favor to neighboring countries, frankly, but we've also done a favor for our country
with that being said, emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don't want to give iran open season to the mediterranean, especially since we really control it
to a large extent, we really have controlled it and we've set control on it
so we'll see what happens
but we're going to be coming home relatively soon
we finished, at least, almost our work with respect to isis in syria, isis in iraq, and we have done a job that nobody has been able to do
but with that being said, i do want to come home
but i want to come home also with having accomplished what we have to accomplish
so we are discussing syria as part of an overall deal
when they made the iran deal, what they should have done is included syria
when i say should have   before giving them, iran, $150 billion and $1
8 billion in cash   $1
8 million in cash
you think about this
before giving this kind of tremendous money, okay   $150 billion and $1
8 billion in cash   in barrels, i hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out   cash   they should have made a deal that covered yemen, that covered syria, that covered other parts of the middle east where iraq is   where iran is involved
they didn't do that
so we want to come home
we'll be coming home
but we want to have a very, very strong   we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint, and that was a very big part of our discussion
okay
thank you
it means they get rid of their nukes
very simple
they get rid of their nukes, and nobody else would say it
it would be very easy for me to make a simple deal and claim victory
i don't want to do that
i want them to get rid of their nukes
and i think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger maybe deal, maybe not deal
we're going to find out, but we'll know fairly soon
president
and if i might add, the states and, as i alluded to   and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the united states and, to a lesser extent, france
but they wouldn't be there except for the united states
they wouldn't last a week
we're protecting them
they have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because i don't think france or the united states should be liable for the tremendous cost
the united states is embarrassingly into the middle east
as of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before   and i don't take responsibility, but i would be very embarrassed if i had to   $7 trillion
and when we want to build, mr
president, our infrastructure, everybody says, oh, we want to be careful with our money
when we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things   tunnels, bridges   they say, oh, let's be careful with our money
and yet, we have spent $7 trillion in the middle east, and we've gotten nothing for it
nothing
less than nothing, as far as i'm concerned
that's over an 18-year period
the countries that are there that you all know very well are immensely wealthy
they're going to have to pay for this
and i think the president and i agree very much on that
and they will pay for it
they will pay for it
we've spoken to them
they will pay for it
the united states will not continue to pay
and they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing
and we will, in fact, bring lots of people home
we will have a strong blockage to the mediterranean, which to me is very important   because if we don't, you have iran going right to the mediterranean
not going to have that
but there is a chance   and nobody knows what i'm going to do on the 12th, although, mr
president, you have a pretty good idea   but we'll see
but we'll see also, if i do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations
because this a deal with decayed foundations
it's a bad deal
it's a bad structure
it's falling down
should have never, ever been made
i blame congress
i blame a lot of people for it
but it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th
but i will say, if iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid
okay
yes, john
please
john roberts of fox
well, i haven't heard of the particular allegations, but i will tell you he's one of the finest people that i have met, and i think speaking for melania, also
he's been the doctor for president obama, i believe for president bush, for me
i've gotten to know him pretty well
he's a great doctor
and it was a suggestion
now, i know there's an experience problem because of lack of experience
but there's an experience problem   the veterans administration is very important to me
we've done a great job with it, as you know, with the accountability act and many other things
now we're working on choice
it's going to happen
we're going to take great care of our veterans
that's a very, very important thing, and we've done a great job
but i told admiral jackson just a little while ago, i said, what do you need this for
this is a vicious group of people that malign   and they do
and i've lived through it
we all lived through it
you people are getting record ratings because of it, so congratulations
but i said, what do you need it for
he's an admiral
he's a great leader
and they questioned him about every little thing
as you know, with the success of what will hopefully soon be secretary of state pompeo, everybody was very surprised
i heard 10 minutes before the vote yesterday on committee that, he will not be approved at committee   which would be the first time in many, many decades that something like that would have happened with regard to a secretary of state   except i spoke to rand paul, and rand paul has really never let me down
rand paul is a good man
and i knew things that nobody else knew
and rand paul said, i'm going to change my vote, and he voted, and everybody was surprised
and he actually got an 11-9 vote, because as you know, johnny isakson's vote counts if it isn't the deciding vote
so it was actually a 11-9 with, i believe, an   there was one vote   what would you call that, john
not present
oh, it's called present
okay
so it was 11-9 and that was a terrific thing
but they failed to stop him
so now they say, who's next
who's next
and this person, admiral jackson   dr
jackson   is a wonderful man
i said to him, what do you need it for
and as far as experience is concerned, the veterans administration   which is approximately 13 million people   is so big, you could run the biggest hospital system in the world and it's small time compared to the veterans administration
so nobody has the experience
what he is is a leader and a good man
but i told him   i said, you know what, doc
you're too fine a person
his son is a top student at annapolis
he's a high-quality person
i said, what do you need it for
so he'll be making   it's totally his decision   but he'll be making a decision
but they failed with mike pompeo, and that was a big, big hit because they thought they could stop him and embarrass
the democrats have become obstructionists
that's all they're good at
they're not good at anything else
they have bad ideas
they have bad politics
the one thing they do is obstruct
and that's why i'm waiting for   you would never believe this   i'm waiting for very good people like the ambassador to germany
hasn't been approved yet
it's been in there for 11 or 12 months
we have angela merkel coming to the united states on friday
we still don't have our ambassador approved
and at this rate   and many of the papers checked it out yesterday, and they actually said i was right   but it would be nine years before these people are approved
we have hundreds of people in waiting to be approved, and the democrats are taking 30 hours per person
they're taking the maximum time
they are obstructions
that's very bad for our country
i said to dr
jackson, what do you need it for
so we'll see what happens
i don't want to put a man through who's not a political person
i don't want to put a man through a process like this
it's too ugly and too disgusting
so we'll see what happens
he'll make a decision
oh, i would definitely stand behind him
he's a fine man
i'll always stand behind him
i'd let it be his choice
but he is a man who has just been an extraordinary person
his family, extraordinary success
great doctor
great everything
and he has to listen to the abuse that he has to   i wouldn't if i were him
actually, in many ways, i'd love to be him
but the fact is, i wouldn't do it
i wouldn't do it
what does he need it for
to be abused by a bunch of politicians that aren't thinking nicely about our country
i really don't think, personally, he should do it
but it's totally his   i would stand behind him   totally his decision
we've pretty much finished with isis, and we're going to be making some big decisions in a very short period of time
but we're working very closely together with france and with the president
okay
thank you very much
well, i think that we have very much in common, i must say
i think many things that we   certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change and we can be flexible
you know, in life you have to be flexible
and as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility
and i think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today
and i will say, france is a great country
and i believe france will be taken to new heights under this president
he's going to be an outstanding president
one of your great presidents
and it's an honor to call you my friend
thank you
thank you very much
thank you
today, i'm honored to welcome my friend, prime minister turnbull of australia and mrs
turnbull
thank you very much
it's great honor
we're looking forward to sending our newly nominated ambassador, admiral harry harris, to very shortly
he's an outstanding man
you're going to find that he is a great man
i want to thank the prime minister for offering his condolences on the horrible tragedy in parkland, florida
americans are grateful for the prayers and support of our australian friends, and friends they are, as our entire nation grieves the senseless loss of 17 precious lives and all the horribly injured
the united states and australia are currently honoring 100 years of mateship, a term that you used very beautifully, mr
prime minister
a century has passed since brave americans and australians first fought together in world war i
over the last 100 years, our partnership has thrived as a bulwark of freedom, security and democracy
last spring, the prime minister and i celebrated the remarkable 100-year milestone during an extraordinary evening on the uss intrepid
and my friend, greg norman and anthony pratt and some of the others in the room today, they were   hello, folks
stand up, greg
stand up, anthony
where is anthony
good
it was a great evening
thank you
this afternoon, i'm pleased to announce that the united states will named the littoral combat ship 30 the uss canberra in honor of australian crews lost fighting alongside the u
navy during world war ii
our secretary of the navy has chosen australian minister of defense marise payne to be her sponsor
i know that the uss canberra will be a worthy successor to both her australian namesake and her american predecessor, the former navy baltimore class heavy cruiser, uss canberra
as she sails the open sea, the new uss canberra will symbolize to all who cross her path the enduring friendship between the united states and australia
there is no closer friendship
today, strengthened by our common values and history, we're working together to promote our mutual interests
i want to thank the prime minister for serving as a strong voice for peace and stability across the entire indo-pacific region
australia is one of our closest partners in our campaign of maximum pressure to denuclearize the korean peninsula
today, we put the strongest sanctions on korea that we have ever put on a country
we must continue to stand together to prevent the brutal dictatorship from threatening the world with nuclear devastation
our nations, likewise, share a commitment to keeping our people safe
australian troops are currently serving alongside americans and our partners in afghanistan and the coalition to defeat isis
today, we're denying terrorists' safe haven, cutting off their funding and discrediting their wicked ideology
isis land has been largely recaptured almost 100 percent
i'm very honored to say
and they are on the run
our strong partnership can also be seen in our flourishing economic relationship
australia remains the key market for u
defense products
we make the greatest products in the world, so you have very good taste in choosing our product
automobiles and aircraft and our fair and reciprocal trading relationship is a model for other countries as we seek bilateral agreements
news that america is open for business has also reached australian shores
in may, australian entrepreneur anthony pratt announced a new $2 billion investment in box making factories across the united states
but he only did that if trump won the election, i think
is that a correct statement, anthony
thank you
boy, that was a close one
i was worried
these people would have had a field day if you gave the wrong answer
thank you
no, but anthony did call and he said if he wins the election, we're going to spend billions of dollars in the united states and i appreciate your giving me a very, very correct comment
thank you, anthony
i'll never do that again
this investment will continue to build on an almost 100,000 american jobs that are taking place and already supportive by australian companies
i'm glad to share that the united states is also, by far, the largest investor in australia
in the room today are dozens of american and australian business leaders and great athletes, great athletes and business leader, by the way, greg, who are working together to identify further opportunities for bilateral investment and cooperation
prime minister, i also want to take the opportunity to congratulate you on your immigration reforms and on australia's commitment to merit-based immigration
are my friends from congress listening to that
merit based
we want to do merit-based immigration also
and we will
that really protects the interest of australia and its people
it's the way to go
you've been very successful with it
here, we're working very hard to do the same
in that sense, we're going to hopefully follow in your footprints
prime minister turnbull, it's been a pleasure to host you today
great lunch with your representatives
a lot was discussed and lot of deals were made for the purchase of additional military equipment and other things
for a century now, the people of the united states and australia have inspired the world with their determination, their bravery and their generosity
i know that our close friendship and enduring alliance and our personal friendship will grow even stronger in the century to come
our relationship with australia will always be a very powerful and very successful relationship
it's been incredible and it's only getting better
thank you very much
thank you
well, thank you very much, malcolm
that's very beautiful words and we appreciate it
on behalf of the first lady, who is right here and our great vice president, mike, thank you very much
it's an honor to have you
we'll answer a couple of questions
is that ok
how about trey from one america news
trey, where are you
go ahead
yes
how about one
go ahead, trey
well, we're going to do a lot, but we are going to be very strong on background checks
i've spoken with many of our people in congress, our senators, our congressmen and women
and there's a movement on to get something done
we want to be very powerful on background checks
when we are dealing with the mentally ill, as we were in this last case, he was a very sick person and somebody that should have been nabbed
i guess they had 39 different occasions where they were able to see him or potentially see him
we want to be very powerful, very strong on background checks and especially as it pertains to the mentally ill
we're going to get rid of the bump stocks and we're going to do certain other things
but one of the feelings that i have   and you probably heard me in a speech this morning   very, very important that we have offensive capability as well as defensive capability within the schools, because when you have a gun-free zone, you're really inviting people to come in and do whatever you have to do and often times get out
now, i was the one that brought up the fact that these shootings, on average, last three minutes and it takes anywhere from six to ten minutes for the police to get to the site
and i want to have people in the building and, in many cases you have ex-marines, ex-army, navy, air force, coast guard, you have them in the building and they can have concealed weapons and still be teachers or they could be in the building in a different capacity
but we have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage
but we'll be putting in strong language having to do with the background checks and that will take place very quickly
i spoke with paul ryan this morning, with mitch mcconnell
and people are looking to really energize
i know that you had   this has been going on for a long time, many, many years
and you've had people in my position and they would mention things, but not a lot of things got done, obviously
we take it very seriously
we want to put an end to it
and if   by the way, the bad guy thinks that somebody is in this room with a weapon that's going to be pointed at him with live bullets, he's not even going into the school
that's the one way you're going to solve it
you're not going to solve it with gun-free spaces because they'll get in there and they're going to be the only one with a gun
so, we need offensive capability and we are going to be doing something about it
we're dealing with congress right now
thank you
well, i think it's going to make it safer
and, you know, the problem that's been happening over the last 20 years is people have talked
you said it, it's all talk, it's no action
and we're going to take action
i think it's going to make it safer
i think the fact that you have some capability within a school, they're not going to go into that school
they're not going to do it
you can look at what's happened with airplanes
we put marshals on planes with guns, where pilots in many cases have guns
nothing has happened in a long period of time when it used to almost it was getting to the point of being routine
when you have somebody with a gun staring you down, it's going to be a lot different for them to walk into those schools
right now, they look at the sign outside
this is a gun-free environment
that means they're the only one with a gun
and the damage this lunatic did in that school for such a long period of time
and frankly, you had a gun and he was outside as a guard and he decided not to go in
that was not his finest moment
that, i can tell you
he waited and he didn't want to go into the school
i just heard this
and it's a terrible situation
but we need people that can take care of our children
we're not going to let this happen again
and the way it's not going to happen again   because they're basically cowards
innately, they're cowards
and if they know bad things happen to them once they get into that school, by people that love the children   see, a security guard doesn't know the children, doesn't love the children
this man standing outside of the school the other day doesn't love the children, probably doesn't know the children
the teachers love their children
they love their pupils
they love their students
they're doing it also for love
now they have to be very adept
i'm not talking about every teacher
i'm talking about a small percentage
but people that have great ability with weaponry, with guns, those are the only people i'm talking about
but they'll protect the student
for the prime minister
i will say, what russia and what iran and what syria have done recently is a humanitarian disgrace
i will tell you that
we're there for one reason
we're there to get isis and get rid of isis and go home
we're not there for any other reason
and we've largely accomplished our goal
but what those three countries have done to people over the last short period of time is a disgrace
ok, would you like to ask a question, mr
prime minister
well, i think the trans-pacific partnership was not a good deal for us
and if they made it a good deal for us, i'd go in
but honestly, it wasn't
i like bilateral deals much more than multilateral
i like to be able to negotiate with one country, and if it doesn't work out, you terminate
and during the termination notice, right after you consent, they call you and they say, please
but trans-pacific partnership   tpp was a very bad deal for the united states
it would have cost us tremendous amounts of jobs, would have been bad
but there is a possibility we would go in, but they will be offering us a much better deal
i would certainly do that
as far as your lanes are concerned, we'd love to have australia involved
and i think australia wants us to stay involved
i have to say, we've developed a great relationship with china, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time   killing us, absolutely killing the united states on trade
but we have developed a great relationship with china
probably closer than we've ever had
and my personal relationship, as malcolm can tell you, with president xi is, i think, quite extraordinary
he's somebody that i like and i think he likes me
with that being said, he likes china and i like the united states
but a lot of things are happening
it's going to be a very interesting period of time
but we do have to straighten out   and as much as i like and respect   really respect president xi, we have to straighten out the trade imbalance
so much, it's no good
malcolm turnbull
well, to the second, we'll have to see
i don't think i'm going to exactly play that card
but we'll have to see
if the sanctions don't work, we'll have to go phase two
and phase two may be a very rough thing
may be very, very unfortunate for the world
but hopefully the sanctions will work
we have tremendous support all around the world for what we're doing
it really is a rogue nation
if we can make a deal, it'll be a great thing
and if we can't, something will have to happen
so we'll see
as far as general mattis is concerned, i mean, he has that view, and a lot of people have that view
china's tough
they're getting stronger
they're getting stronger, to a large extent, with a lot of the money they've made from having poor leadership in the united states, because the united states leadership has allowed them to get away with murder
with that being said, i think we can have a truly great, even trading relationship with china
hopefully, that's going to work out
and hopefully, the relationship i have with president xi will make that happen
only time will tell
thank you
i don't think we've ever had a better relationship with china than we do right now
the only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it's so one- sided, it's so lopsided
and the people that stood here for many years, in this position, right where i am right now, should never have allowed that to happen
it's very unfair to the united states, and it's very unfair to the workers of the united states
very, very unfair
and even today, it's extremely hard on companies that want to do business in china, because the barriers are incredible, whereas the barriers coming into our country are foolishly not
foolishly
i believe in reciprocal trade
if they do something to us, we do something to them
well, that never happened, and it's gotten worse and worse over the years
but we'll correct it
that can be the only thing that can get in the way of a truly long-term great relationship
because we have all the ingredients for friendship
from the washington examiner, gabby
yep
well, jared's done an outstanding job
i think he's been treated very unfairly
he's a high-quality person
he works for nothing, just so   you know, nobody ever reports that, but he gets zero
he doesn't get a salary, nor does ivanka, who's now in south korea   long trip   representing her country
and we cannot get a better representative
in fact, the first lady, melania, was telling me what a great impression she made this morning when she landed in south korea
jared is truly outstanding
he's   he's   he was very successful when he was in the private sector
he's working on peace in the middle east and some other small and very easy deals
they've always said, peace in the middle east
we're actually making great headway
jerusalem was the right thing to do
we took that off the table
but jared kushner's right in the middle of that, and he's an extraordinary deal-maker
and if he does that, that will be an incredible accomplishment and a very important thing for our country
so general kelly, who's doing a terrific job, by the way, is right in the middle of that
we inherited a system that's broken
it's a system where many people have just   it's taken months and months and months to get many people that do not have the complex financial   you know, complicated financials   they don't have that, and it's still taken months
it's a broken system, and it shouldn't take this long
you know how   how many people are on that list   people with not a problem in the world
so that'll be up to general kelly
general kelly respects jared a lot and general kelly will make that call
i won't make that call
i will let the general, who's right here, make that call
but jared's doing some very important things for our country
he gets paid zero
ivanka, by the way, gets paid zero
she gave up a very good and very strong, solid, big business in order to come to washington, because she wanted to help families and she wanted to help women
she said, dad
and i said you know
so i will let general kelly make that decision
and he's going to do what's right for the country
and i have no doubt he'll make the right decision, ok
thank you very much
and i have to add to that
they're very different countries with very different sets of problems
but i think we're well on the way to solving that horrible problem that happens far too often in the united states
thank you very much, everybody
we appreciate it
thank you
prime minister, thank you very much
thank you very much
i just want to say that we just spent quite a bit of time inside with the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who has been a friend of mine for a long time, long before my world of politics, early into his world of politics, i think
but we've been friends for a long time
we are probably now, despite what we read, we're probably now   i think, at least as far as i'm concerned   closer than ever before
and the relationship is very good
we're fighting for the same thing
we're fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation
we're fighting for tax reform, as part of that
we are getting close to healthcare
we'll come up in the early- to mid-part of next year
we're going to have a vote
i think we already have the votes
we feel confident we have the votes
we pretty much know what the plan is
i believe republicans and democrats are, as we speak, working together very hard, right now   working together to do an intermediate plan, a short-term plan, because obamacare is a disaster
the rates have gone up
the premiums have gone up
the deductibles have gone through the roof
i mean, it's terrible
if you look at the deductibles, unless you really have a problem, you're not going to be able to use them
so we have been working together long and hard
we think we're in good shape for the budget, we hope
and we hope to be in good shape with, again, the largest tax cuts ever passed in this country
it's going to spur business
you look at other countries, what they've done   and we're competing with other countries
when china is at 15 percent, when i hear that ireland is going to be reducing their cooperate rates down to 8 percent from 12
but you have other countries also reducing
we can't be at 35 percent and think we're going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs
so we worked on that
i was very honored to see a man that i've had a lot of respect for, james lee witt, of the clinton administration   the head of fema
he gave us an a-plus
i just see   it just came out
and i've always had respect for him
he gave us   he's the fema director of the clinton administration   gave us an a-plus for how we responded to the hurricane aftermath   all of the hurricanes
and that includes puerto rico
so i just want to thank mr
witt, wherever you may be now, wherever you may be listening
i just want to say, i really much appreciate it
because that took it out of politics   out of the world of politics, in that he was with the clinton administration and i'm sure remains loyal to the clinton administration
i hope he does
so just to finish off, my relationship with this gentleman is outstanding, has been outstanding
we are working very hard to get the tax cuts
we will continue to work hard to get the healthcare completed
i'm going to be surprising some people with an economic development bill later on, but i haven't even told mitch because i want to focus on tax cuts and some other things right now
one of the unspoken elements that we discussed at lunch   and it just is not talked about   yes, we got a great justice, justice gorsuch, into the united states supreme court
he is going to be outstanding, hopefully for many, many years
but something that people aren't talking about is how many judges we've had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges
we have   tremendous   right now under review
the democrats are holding them up beyond anything   beyond comprehension, they're holding them up
i mean, frankly, they have terrible, terrible policy   terrible policy   and perhaps they're not even good politicians, but they are good at obstruction
so i looked at some of these numbers, between the judges   and i want to say that we will set records in terms of the number of judges
and if you read the wall street journal, i have to give them a little bit of a   a person, a writer, i won't mention names   but you can see who has really been a really fair person   wrote an article or wrote an editorial, in a sense, saying how well we're doing with judges and appointments
i think it's one of the big unsung things of this administration, in addition to the fact that we have had a lot of legislation passed on the va and lots of other things
but the judge story is an untold story
nobody wants to talk about it
but when you think about it, mitch and i were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out
so numerous have been approved
many, many are in the pipeline
the level of quality is extraordinary
and i just wanted to say that we're working very closely on that also, and getting really great reviews from those people and, in many cases, some scholars that have been studying it
there has never been anything like what we've been able to do together with judges
so with that, i'd like to have mitch say a few words, and if you want to do a little question-and-answer, we can do that also
thank you very much
thank you
obviously passing a budget, which enables tax reform and tax reduction comes next, then a supplemental to take adequate care of those who have been harmed by the natural disasters we've been afflicted with lately
and, of course, the senate's unique role   it seems to be a lot of people forget   we're in the personnel business
there are 1,200 of the president's nominations subject to confirmation in the senate
the house is not in the personnel business
we are
the single-most significant thing this president has done to change america is the appointment of neil gorsuch to the supreme court
but it's not just the supreme court
there are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level, as the president has indicated, of young, conservative   and when we say conservative about a judge, what we're talking about here are, the kind of the people the president is appointing to the courts believe that the role of a judge is to try to rule based upon what the law says, not what they hoped the outcome would be
justice scalia used to say, if the judge is not occasionally unhappy with the conclusion he reached, he's not a very good judge
or as justice gorsuch put it down in my state a couple of weeks ago, judges don't wear red, they don't wear blue   they wear black
and those are the kind of people the president is sending up to the senate to be confirmed
many of them, as he pointed out, are younger and will be on the bench for a long time, and have a great deal to do with what kind of country we're going to have far into the future
legislatively, obviously the top priority is tax reduction
and i think what the president and i would both like to say to you today, contrary to what some of you may have reported
we are together totally on this agenda to move america forward
john
well, i would like to see it be done this year, john
i would like very much to see it be done this year
so we won't go a step further
if we get it done, that's a great achievement
but don't forget it took years for the reagan administration to get taxes done
i've been here for nine months, a little more than nine months
i can say the same thing for healthcare
if you look at obama   first of all, if you look at clinton, they weren't able to get it done
if you look at other administrations, they weren't able to get it done
president obama, after a long period of time, was able to finally push it through, but pushed through something that's now failed   really failing badly
but again, we're meeting   democrat, republican are meeting right now, and right now they're working on something very special
but i have to tell you, i really believe that we have a very good chance, and i think mitch feels the same way, of getting the taxes done, hopefully fairly long before the end of the year
that's what we'd like to see
go ahead
and just to finish up for mitch   and we're nine months, right
so we could have a long way to go, but that's okay
yes
well, let's go to the second part of your question, with mitch
again, we've been doing healthcare for, really, seven months, and probably six months, if you think about it, because we started in probably a total of six months
others were 2
5 years, and much more than that
others were eight years, and they didn't get it passed
this man is going to get it done, and i think get it done long before anybody else, and i think it's going to be a great healthcare
as far as tom marino, so he was a very early supporter of mine   the great state of pennsylvania
he's a great guy
i did see the report
we're going to look into the report and we're going to take it very seriously
because we're going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem
and i want to get that absolutely right
this country   and, frankly, the world   has a drug problem
the world has a drug problem
but we have it, and we're going to do something about it
so i'm going to have a major announcement on that problem next week
we're going to be looking into tom
well, i have a very good relationship, as you know, with steve bannon
steve has been a friend of mine for a long time
i like steve a lot
steve is doing what steve thinks is the right thing
some of the people that he may be looking at, i'm going to see if we talk him out of that, because, frankly, they're great people
what mitch will tell you is that maybe, with the exception of a few   and that is a very small few   i have a fantastic relationship with the people in the senate, and with the people in congress
i mean, i have a   with our house of representatives
i have a great relationship with political people
if you read the papers, you think   i'm like on one island and they're like on the other
well, it's not the way it is
we have a fantastic relationship
i'm friends with most of them, i can say
and i don't think anybody could have much of a higher percentage
but i'm friends with most of them
i like and respect most of them, and i think they like and respect me
just so you understand, the republican party is very, very unified
when we get things approved, we have to go through hell because we have no democrat support, we have nobody
we don't have a vote from the democrats
as an example
massive tax cuts   we may not get any democrat votes
now, we also may get three of four, but we may get no   for massive tax cuts
we're the highest-taxed country in the world, and yet we may get no democrat support
and that's because they're obstructionists and they just basically want us to do badly, but that's not going to happen
yes, go ahead
we're going to look at that very closely
well, he's a good man
i have not spoken to him, but i will speak to him and i'll make that determination
and if i think it's one percent negative to doing what we want to do, i will make a change, yes
one second
yes
we are going to be doing that next week
by the way, you know that's a big step
by the way, people have no understanding of what you just said
that is a very, very big statement
it's a very important step
and to get to that step, a lot of work has to be done and it's time-consuming work
we're going to be doing in next week, okay
my goal as the leader of the republican party in the senate is to keep us in the majority
the way you do that is not complicated
you have to have nominate people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home
we changed the business model in 2014
we nominated people who could win everywhere
we took the majority in the senate
we had one skirmish in 2016
we kept the majority in the senate
so our operating approach will be to support our incumbents and, in open seats, to seek to help nominate people who can actually win in november
that's my approach and that's the way you keep a governing majority
yes
exactly right
so the insurance companies have made a fortune with obamacare   an absolute fortune
as you know, what i did with the cuts at the end, which were all going   you know, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a month going right into the pockets of the insurance companies
and i'm very happy with what i did
and because of that, people are talking now
democrats are talking to the republicans for a short-term taking care of, what we will call, healthcare so that people can have good healthcare without a big spike
you would have had massive spikes   you already have
i mean, every year the massive spikes to obamacare have been ridiculous
as far as   and i didn't speak to mitch about this today, but a priority of mine   and you know that this is coming up   will be the cost of prescription drugs
we are going to get the costs way down, way down, and those drugs companies   so you have the insurance companies, in the one case
in the other case   actually, with regard to both, you have the drug companies
they contribute massive amounts of money to political people   i don't know, mitch, maybe even to you
but i have to tell you, they contribute massive amounts of money
me, i'm not interested in their money
i don't need their money
i will tell you, you have prescription drugs   you go to england, you go to various places, canada   you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything, is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the united states
we are going to get drug prices   prescription drug prices way down because the world has taken advantage of us
the world has taken advantage of us when that happens, so that's going to be very important
yeah
well, that's what we're looking to do, joe
we want to get it down so that people can have affordable healthcare
look, you look at some states   116 percent up
in alaska, over 200 percent up
in other states, 50 percent, 70 percent up, and those are some of the states that are doing better
obamacare is a wreck, it's a mess, it's destroying lives
we want to get it in those states   the states that i did so well in   but also in states that i didn't win
i want to get healthcare that's much more affordable and much better healthcare, and that's what we're doing
yes
go ahead   tax reform
yeah
so we are doing minor adjustments
we want to make sure that the middle class is the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts and tax reform
and that's, i'm sure, what mitch meant also, because people get it confused
we are doing massive tax cuts
we're also doing simplification and reform
simplification, where, literally, if we can do it on page
now, in some cases, it may be two pages
but we're doing major simplification
we're bringing the categories down from   if you include zero, because there are zero   we're bringing it from eight to four
that's a big, big simplification, just that alone
but we are doing the massive cuts
and i will say this
wherever i've been, this has been so popular with the people
now we have to get a couple of additional people to raise their hands
mitch
i've written them personal letters
they've been sent, or they're going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend
i will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families   because i have done that, traditionally
i felt very, very badly about that
i always feel badly
it's the toughest   the toughest calls i have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed
it's a very difficult thing
now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day   it's a very, very tough day
for me, that's by far the toughest
so, the traditional way   if you look at president obama and other presidents, most of them didn't make calls, a lot of them didn't make calls
i like to call when it's appropriate, when i think i'm able to do it
they have made the ultimate sacrifice
so, generally, i would say that i like to call
i'm going to be calling them
i want a little time to pass
i'm going to be calling them
i have   as you know, since i've been president, i have
but in addition, i actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers we're talking about, and they're going to be going out either today or tomorrow
yes
i think cuba knew about it, sure
i do believe cuba is responsible
i do believe that
and it's a very unusual attack, as you know, but i do believe cuba is responsible, yes
well, i'm going to be meeting with roy sometime next week, and we're going to talk to him about a lot of different things
but i'll be meeting with him
he ran a very strong race
the people of alabama, who i like very much and they like me very much, but they like roy
and we'll be talking to him, and i can report to you then
okay
go ahead
my view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge is simply a notification of how you're going to vote
to conclude otherwise would have left us in the following position at the beginning of this senate
forty-eight democratic senators would have been able to blackball 62 percent of the circuit judge nominees
that's simply not a tenable place to land in a senate that now deals with judges with a simple majority
so my own personal view is that a blue slip on a circuit judge should simply be a notification of how you intend to vote
we could talk blue slips, but my attitude is i just want really capable people going to the courts
peter
well, let me just explain what's different
we have nominations pending right now, and we have 182 approved   if you look at this
the number that he had approved was 65 percent and 70 percent, and we have 39 percent
they're holding up every single nomination
schumer and the group are holding up every single nomination
they are obstructing
they're doing   i'm telling you, they're not good politicians, but they're very good at obstruction
they are holding up every single nomination, and i will tell you, peter, it's not right
it's really not right
they'll bring them right out to the end at last minute
what they're doing is unfair
so you look at even bush, you look at obama, you look at clinton, and you look at bush original, you have 389 versus 182   these are approvals
you look at clinton, 357 versus 182
you look at president obama, 364 versus 182
these are nominations approved, and what they're doing to us   we have unbelievable people, and they're waiting to be approved
they've been waiting for a long period of time
now, i do believe that mitch is going to start pushing them very hard, and he can do that, and he wants to do that
he also wants to get the judicial nominations through, and he wants to get them through fast, too
go ahead, john
go ahead, john
well, i hope to have a relationship
if we don't, we don't
i mean, we have races coming up, as you know, in a year from now
i think we're going to probably do very well
i can say this
if we get taxes approved, we're going to do unbelievably well
many of the senators are running in states that i won by massive amounts   20, over 20 percent, sometimes 30 percent
i guess in one or two cases, by over 40 percent over the democrat
well, we're going to let you know that
i would like to give you that answer in about seven years from now, is that okay
meaning, one plus seven
john, i hope to be able to because i like the concept of bipartisan
but right now, they are doing nothing but obstructing
and really, if you think about it, they're against major tax cuts that's going to make our country stronger and more competitive
that's a hard thing to win an election on, and i believe that some democrats will be voting for us when it comes to the tax cuts
i'm going to be proposing an economic development bill in the not-too-distant future
i want to get tax cuts, obviously, done first
maybe even healthcare
but i think somewhere in between or shortly thereafter i'm going to be developing an economic development bill that will put us so far ahead of other countries you will not even believe it
that will be very important
and a lot of praise
well, we're very opposite in terms of incentives and incentives for jobs and other things
and if you look at what's happened, we just hit a new high today again in the stock market
we've picked up, mitch, as of this moment, $5
2 trillion in stock market value
we have the lowest unemployment rate in   i believe it's almost 17 years
we're doing well
we're going to be doing immigration work that's going to be outstanding, and we're going to have people coming into our country based hopefully on a merit system, not just coming in randomly
but they're going to be coming in based on a merit system where they can help us
because i have companies moving into this country   you saw what happened with the automobile industry last week with five major plants
we have companies pouring back into this country for the first time in anybody's memory
we are actually going to be, fairly soon, at a point where we're going to need workers
our country is going to do so well
but the tax cuts are going to be a major, major part of it
well, not too many, i must say
it's the opposite side of the spectrum
peter
go ahead, peter
i don't know if he did
no, no, no, i was told that he didn't often
and a lot of presidents don't
they write letters
i do
excuse me, peter
i do a combination of both
sometimes   it's a very difficult thing to do, but i do a combination of both
president obama i think probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn't
i don't know
that's what i was told
all i can do   all i can do is ask my generals
other presidents did not call
they'd write letters
and some presidents didn't do anything
but i like the combination of   i like, when i can, the combination of a call and also a letter
one at a time
go ahead
well, i'd like to see it end
look, the whole russian thing was an excuse
excuse me
excuse me
the whole russia thing was an excuse for the democrats losing the election, and it turns out to be just one excuse
i mean, today hillary blamed nigel farage
that one came out of nowhere
so that was just an excuse for the democrats losing an election that, frankly, they have a big advantage in the electoral college
they should always be able to win in the electoral college, but they were unable to do it
so there has been absolutely no collusion
it's been stated that they have no collusion
they ought to get to the end of it because i think the american public is sick of it
go ahead
go ahead
yes
well, i can't comment on bowe bergdahl because he's   as you know, they're   i guess he's doing something today, as we know
and he's also   they're setting up sentencing, so i'm not going to comment on him
but i think people have heard my comments in the past
go ahead
go ahead
well, they should be able to do something
but we need very stronger border security, and we do want the wall
go ahead
no, they haven't
in fact, i spoke to governor brown
we had a great conversation
we have fema there
and as you know, james lee witt gave us an a-plus, and i think if he didn't include the fires, he would include the fires also
we have fema there
we have military there
we have first responders there
it's a tragic situation
but we're working very closely with the representatives from california, and we're doing a good job
go ahead, back
yes, go ahead, back
all i can say is it's totally fake news
it's just fake
it's fake
it's made-up stuff, and it's disgraceful what happens
but that's happens in the world of politics
jon
our country needs a wall
mexico, you see what's happening there
you see what just happened yesterday with one of their big political leaders
mexico is not doing particularly well when it comes to the kind of thing that we have great interest in
drugs are pouring across our border
we're stopping it, but we need a wall to really stop it
we need a wall in this country
you know it
i know it
everybody knows it
we have to have a wall, so that's going to be part of it
the puerto rico situation is so   because as you know
oh, i think   well, that's according to the clinton administration's head of fema, it's been outstanding
puerto rico is very tough because of the fact it's an island
but it's also tough because, as you know, it was in very poor shape before the hurricanes ever hit
their electrical grid was destroyed before the hurricanes got there
it was in very bad shape, was not working, was in bankruptcy, owed $9 billion
and then on top of that, the hurricane came
now, you're going to have to build a whole new electrical plant system
we're not talking about generators
we moved   puerto rico now has more generators, i believe, than any place in the world
there are generators all over the place
the fact is, their electrical system was in horrible shape before and even worse shape after
so we are working right now   as you know, relief funds were just approved and are in the process of being approved by congress
and that includes texas, by the way
that includes florida
and it also includes puerto rico, the u
virgin islands, et cetera
but it was in really bad shape before
we have done   i will say this, we have done
well, we've delivered tremendous amounts of water
then what you have to do is you have to have distribution of the water by the people on the island
so we have massive amounts of water
we have massive amounts of food
but they have to distribute the food, and they have to do this
they have to distribute the food to the people on the island
so what we've done is we now actually having military distributing food   something that really they shouldn't have to be doing
but if you look at the governor, who is a good man, by the way, but if you look at the governor of puerto rico, he himself has said we've done an outstanding job
and most people have said we've done an outstanding job
but puerto rico is a very tough one
yes, go ahead
well, i'll let mitch
you want to talk about that, mitch
go ahead
well, i'll be going, as you know, to south korea, to china, to japan, to vietnam for the summit
we have a big economic summit there
i may be going to the philippines also
we've been invited to the philippines, so i may be going to the philippines
and i look forward to all of them
we haven't set the details as of this moment
we'll take a look at that
i didn't hear in terms of provoking, but we will certainly take a look at that
no, not at all
we don't like the fact that they're clashing
we're not taking sides, but we don't like the fact that they're clashing
let me tell you, we've had for many years a very good relationship with the kurds, as you know
and we've also been on the side of iraq, even though we should have never been in there in the first place
we should never have been there
but we're not taking sides in that battle
john
oh, i hope hillary runs
is she going to run
i hope
hillary, please run again
go ahead
i think she's wrong
look, when they take a knee   there's plenty of time to do knees and there's plenty of time to do lots of other things
but when you take a knee
but when you take a knee   well, that's why she lost the election
honestly, it's that thinking   that is the reason she lost the election
when you go down and take a knee or any other way, you're sitting essentially for our great national anthem, you're disrespecting our flag and you're disrespecting our country
and the nfl should have suspended some of these players for one game
not fire them   suspended them for one game
and then if they did it again, it could have been two games and three games and then for the season
you wouldn't have people disrespecting our country right now
and if hillary clinton actually made the statement that, in a form, sitting down during the playing of our great national anthem is not disrespectful, then i fully understand why she didn't win
i mean look, there are a lot of reasons that she didn't win, including the fact that she was not good at what she did
but i will tell you that is something that i had just heard about, and i think that her statement in itself is very disrespectful to our country
thank you very much
it is very disrespectful to our country when they take a knee during our national anthem
it is very
just hear it
hear it
it is very disrespectful to our country when they take a knee during the national anthem, number one
number two, the people of our country are very angry at the nfl
all you have to do is look at their ratings and look at their stadiums
you see empty seats where you never saw them before
a lot of people are very angry at it
it is highly disrespectful
they shouldn't do it
thank you very much, everybody
thank you
i don't think so
good afternoon
i'm greatly honored to welcome president mariano rajoy of spain, and it's a great honor to have you at the white house
thank you very much
we've just concluded a very productive conversation on a crucial range of economic and security issues
before we begin, i'd like to take a moment to send america's hearts and prayers to the people of puerto rico and the u
virgin islands
both have been devastated   and i mean absolutely devastated   by hurricane maria, and we're doing everything in our power to help the hard-hit people of both places, puerto rico and the virgin islands
and a massive effort is underway, and we have been really treated very, very nicely by the governor and by everybody else
they know how hard we're working and what a good job we're doing
as we speak, fema, our great first responders, and all available federal resources, including the military, are being marshaled to save lives, protect families, and begin a long and very, very difficult restoration process
i have directed all relevant departments and agencies to assist in the response and recovery effort
as governor rosselló just told me this morning, the entire federal workforce is doing great work in puerto rico, and i appreciated his saying it
and he's saying it to anybody that will listen
our team has been incredible after having gone through texas and then florida, with other stops along the way
and he further went on and he said, and through the trump administration's leadership
over the last several weeks our nation has been tested by the destructive force of mother nature, but we will respond to it with an even mightier force
the resolve of the american spirit
texas, louisiana, and florida are in really good shape and moving along well
we thank all of the first responders and volunteers who have risked their lives
and that's what they did   they risked their lives
to all of those impacted by the trouble and these horrible hurricanes and storms that have affected and impacted our country, i thank you
the recovery process will be a very, very difficult one
we will get through this, and we will get through it together
we will be stronger
we will be bigger
we will be better
thank you very much
the united states and spain are great friends and close allies
our bonds, culture, and commerce go back many centuries
our schools teach american children about spain's history of exploration
our museums treasure beautiful spanish works of art
and your country's contributions to architecture, music, and film are admired all over the world
it's a greatly admired country
the deep relationship between our two people is a strong foundation for lasting cooperation
on behalf of the american people, i want to express our support and extend our prayers to all of those affected by the vile terror attack in spain last month
i want to assure the people of spain that america stands with you in confronting this evil that threatens all of humanity
we will continue to deny the terrorists their funding, their territory, and any form of support for their wicked ideology
in this common fight, america greatly appreciates spain's contribution to the coalition to defeat isis
spanish troops and police have trained more than 30,000 members of the iraqi security forces
we also thank the spanish people for being such gracious hosts to the american servicemembers stationed at spanish bases
the united states and spain together face many critical dangers and challenges, from north korea, to iran, to venezuela
we thank spain for its recent decision to expel its north korean ambassador and for standing with us in our efforts to isolate the brutal north korean regime
it is time for all responsible nations to join forces to isolate the north korean menace
north korean nuclear weapons and missile development threaten the entire world with unthinkable loss of life
all nations must act now to ensure the regime's complete denuclearization
i appreciate the united nations security council voting twice, unanimously   15 to nothing, twice   to adopt hard-hitting resolutions against north korea
i have recently issued tough new sanctions against those who do business with this outlaw regime, and i applaud china's latest action to restrict its trade with north korea
and, in particular, i applaud china for breaking off all banking relationships with north korea   something that people would have thought unthinkable even two months ago
i want to thank president xi
here, in the western hemisphere, we have seen the heartbreaking tragedy of maduro's socialist rule in venezuela
spain has been especially helpful in promoting the interests and wellbeing of the venezuelan people, and we thank you for your efforts
we hope our friends in the eu will soon follow the united states, canada, and many latin american nations in sanctioning the maduro regime
we need everybody involved
the citizens of venezuela have endured immense suffering, poverty, starvation, and dangerous political unrest under maduro's oppressive socialist regime
together, spain and the united states hope for peace, for the restoration of democracy, and for the release of all political prisoners
wherever socialism spreads, misery follows
the people of venezuela deserve a future of freedom
these are great people
in the economic arena, we support trade that benefits both spain and the united states, which means it must be fair and it must be reciprocal   such an important word
it hasn't been used very much in the united states   reciprocal
spain is the 10th largest investor in the united states, and i commend spanish business leaders for their confidence in america and the american worker
and considering the fact that our stock market has just hit all-time highs, i think they probably like the united states very much right now
this is a time for both tremendous opportunity for our world, but also serious dangers
as i said at the united nations, which future really is up to us
if we empower our citizens, serve their needs, and appeal to all that is best in the human spirit, then i have no doubt we will succeed like never, ever before
president, i look forward to working with you to build this future of prosperity and peace for both spain and for the united states of america
thank you very much
thank you
thank you very much
steve holland, please
reuters
don't get nervous, steve
well, i wasn't preoccupied with the nfl
i was ashamed of what was taking place, because to me that was a very important moment
i don't think you can disrespect our country, our flag, our national anthem
to me, the nfl situation is a very important situation
i've heard that before about was i preoccupied
not at all
not at all
i have plenty of time on my hands
all i do is work
and to be honest with you, that's an important function of working
it's called respect for our country
many people have died   many, many people
many people are so horribly injured
i was at walter reed hospital recently, and i saw so many great young people, and they're missing legs and they're missing arms
and they've been so badly injured
and they were fighting for our country
they were fighting for our flag
they were fighting for our national anthem
and for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem i think is disgraceful
so i will also say that   again, i read you part of his quote   but the governor of puerto rico is so thankful for the great job that we're doing
we did a great job in texas, a great job in florida, a great job in louisiana
we hit little pieces of georgia and alabama
and frankly, we're doing   and it's the most difficult job because it's on the island
it's on an island in the middle of the ocean
it's out in the ocean
you can't just drive your trucks there from other states
and the governor said we are doing a great job
in fact, he thanked me specifically for fema and all of the first responders in puerto rico
and we're also mentioning with that the u
virgin islands
it was devastated
so we are totally focused on that
but at the same time, it doesn't take me long to put out a wrong, and maybe we'll get it right
i think it's a very important thing for the nfl to not allow people to kneel during the playing of our national anthem, to respect our country and to respect our flag
okay
thank you
well, i think that spain is a great country and it should remain united
we're dealing with a great, great country, and it should remain united
i've been watching that unfold, but it's actually been unfolding for centuries
and i think that nobody knows if they're going to have a vote
i think the president would say they're not going to have a vote
but i think that the people would be very much opposed to that
i can say only speaking for myself, i would like to see spain continue to be united
thank you
major garrett
yes, cbs
yes, hi
okay, well, i'll answer the second one first
we're totally prepared for the second option
not a preferred option
but if we take that option, it will be devastating   i can tell you that   devastating for north korea
that's called the military option
if we have to take it, we will
he's acting very badly
he's saying things that should never, ever be said
and we're replying to those things, but it's a reply
it's not an original statement
it's a reply
but the things that he said over the last year   and if you look back, the things that he said to past administrations   north korea is a situation that should have been handled 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, and five years ago, and it could have been handled much more easily
you had various administrations   many administrations which left me a mess
but i'll fix the mess
so we'll see what happens with north korea
as far as puerto rico is concerned, i think just the opposite
we have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in texas and louisiana, and as we have in florida, as you know, from governor scott and greg abbott
great governors
and this morning, the governor made incredible statements about how well we're doing
we understand it's a disaster
it's a disaster that just happened
the grid was in bad shape before the storm
and puerto rico didn't get hit by one hurricane, it got hit by two hurricanes, and they were among the biggest we've ever seen   with the second one being even worse
i mean, the second one hit puerto rico as a category 5
i don't believe anybody has ever seen that happen before   hit land with that kind of velocity
the governor has been extremely generous and i appreciated it
we right now have our top people from fema, and they have been there
we're are unloading, on an hourly basis, massive loads of water and food and supplies for puerto rico
and this isn't like florida where we can go right up the spine, or like texas where we go right down the middle and we distribute
this is a thing called the atlantic ocean
this is tough stuff
the governor has been so incredible in his statements about the job we're doing
we're doing a great job
don't forget, their police force has been decimated because many of the police in puerto rico have lost their homes
so, sure, they want to be police but they also want to be able to watch their families and find their families, and they have to live
so we're also very much involved in security in puerto rico
so everybody has said it's amazing the job that we've done in puerto rico
we're very proud of it
and i'm going there on tuesday
now, with all of that being said, record   if you look at the amount of water dropped on that island, between the two hurricanes   and the first they just barely got by with, but they were devastated
and the second was a complete wipeout
i mean, this was a place that was destroyed
so i think we've done a really good job
we're continuing to   we are literally unloading, on an hourly basis, water, food, supplies
we have our top people from fema and our first responders and everybody else
we're going to be deploying navy ships   they've already been deployed
and we are going to do far more than anybody else would ever be able to do
and it's being recognized as such, but it is a tough situation
would you have a question or the president
well, i think the people of catalonia have been talking about this for a long time
but i bet you if you had accurate numbers and accurate polling, you'd find that they love their country, they love spain, and they wouldn't leave
so i'm just for united spain
i speak as the president of the united states, as somebody that has great respect for your president, and also has really great respect for your country
i really think the people of catalonia would stay with spain
i think it would be foolish not to
because you're talking about staying with a truly great, beautiful, and very historic country
president, thank you very much
thank you
thank you
thank you very much
it is my great honor to welcome president niinistö to the white house
we've just concluded a very positive meeting and i want to begin today by extending my thoughts and prayers for those affected by hurricane harvey, and the catastrophe of flooding and all of the other difficulties that they're currently going through in houston and southeast texas
and now it's looking more and more like the state of louisiana will be also affected
my administration is coordinating closely with state and local authorities, in texas and louisiana, to save lives, and we thank our first responders, and all of those involved in their efforts
we're working directly with texas governor greg abbott, who by the way is doing a fantastic job, and his entire staff likewise, as well as with governor john bell edwards, who is very much involved in starting the process of louisiana
we've pledged our full support as texas and louisiana battle and recover from this very devastating and historic storm
there's probably never been anything like this
under the supervision of fema administrator brock long, there has been a tremendous amount of work done
he has
he has been so outstanding in so many ways
more than 8,500 federal workers are involved in the texas effort alone
i've also today declared emergencies in louisiana at the request of governor edwards
recovery will be a long and difficult road
and the federal government stands ready willing and able to support that effort
right now the single most important thing is the safety and security of those still in harm's way, including the first responders who have been so terrific and brave
protecting the lives of our people is my highest priority
every asset at my command is at the disposal of local officials
tragic times such as these bring out the best in america's character
strength, charity and resilience are those characters
we see neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping a stranger
and you see that, all of you watch on television
you just see such incredible work and love and teamwork
we are one american family
we heard together we struggled together
and believe me we endure together
we are one family
to the people of texas and louisiana, we are 100 percent with you
we're praying for you
we're working closely with your leaders and officials
and i will be visiting the impact zone tomorrow to ensure that you're receiving full support and cooperation from the federal government
and on saturday we think we're going back to texas
and also we will be going to louisiana
nothing can defeat the unbreakable spirit of the people of texas and louisiana right now
every american heart sends its love and support to those whose lives have been upended, totally up
and totally, by this very horrible storm
we ask god for his wisdom and strength
we will get through this
we will come out stronger
and believe me we will be bigger better stronger than ever before
the rebuilding will begin, and in the end it will be something very special
i just want to thank everybody in the affected area because it has been absolutely incredible to watch the spirit, the cooperation and the love
i would also like to share a message to the people of finland who have recently suffered a terrorist attack in turku
we stand in solidarity with you against the terrorist threat
we must all work together to deny terrorists safe havens cut off their finances and defeat their very wicked ideology
president, americans are grateful for your steadfast support as an ally in the fight against terrorism
we appreciate it, including your membership in the coalition to defeat isis
finland makes important contributions to the coalition in its effort in afghanistan and has troops on the ground in iraq, training iraqi soldiers
in afghanistan, finland provides troops and financial contributions to support the afghan national defense and security forces on a modern day frontier between barbarism and civilization
that's what you have
it's barbarism versus civilization
we are particularly grateful to the finnish citizens who have sacrificed for our mutual security
finland is a leading expert in cybersecurity
in fact we should be calling you pretty soon
you do do a fantastic job with cybersecurity and i congratulate you
and i think in a very short period of time, we're going to be right there with you
believe me
the united states is very proud partner of finland's european center of excellence to counter modern threats, including cyber attacks
in addition we look forward to your leadership as chair of the arctic council
the arctic region has strategic and economic importance for both of our nations
very much so
the foundation of our friendship is our shared love of freedom
on behalf of all americans, i congratulate you and the finnish people on the 100th anniversary of finland's independence
100 years
fantastic
in honor of finland's centennial, the united states is contributing an additional half million dollars to the fulbright finland foundation
through the fulbright program we are sending more of our best and brightest to finland
forging lasting connections between americans and finns on the economic front
we seek fair and reciprocal trade to benefit both of our countries
i applaud finnish companies for their commitment to increase investment in the united states adding new technologies and adding good jobs for hardworking americans
thank you
the u
-finnish partnership is rooted in our shared interests and common values
as president, and i must say and i want to thank you, mr
president, we've discussed and we look forward to further strengthening these bonds of culture, commerce, and cooperation between our two countries, so that our citizens and our nations can thrive and prosper together
president i like to thank you very much for being at the white house, and had a great meeting in the oval office
it's my honor to have you here
thank you
thank you
so  we'll take a couple of questions
how about we go to texas
todd gillman
no, i think that you're going to see very rapid action from congress, certainly from the president
and you're going to get your funding
it's a terrible tragedy
your governor has been absolutely outstanding in the job he's done and his entire staff
and i will say that i just spoke with greg and he is working 24/7
we expect to have requests on our desk fairly soon and we think that congress will feel very much the way i feel
very ,in a very bipartisan way
that will be nice but we think we're going to have what you need and it's going to go fast
texas is a unique place
it's a great, great state great people
and i think you'll be up and running very very quickly
really very quickly
so yeah i think you're going to be in fantastic shape
i've already spoken to congress and everybody feels for you and feels for what you're going through
but at the same time they have great respect, even additional respect for the state because you've handled it so well, so brilliantly
but it's a long road
still pouring
still a lot of rain nobody's ever seen anything like it
i've heard the words epic
i've heard historic
that's what it is
but you'll have what you want
i think very very quickly
and todd you can ask a question to the president
i think it has nothing to do with it really
i think this is separate
this has got to go really very very quickly
again i've spoken to many of the people we're talking about and everybody feels the same way i do
well i consider many countries as a security threat, unfortunately when you look at what's going on in the world today
as you know few weeks ago our great vice president mike pence who's right here was in the region and spent quite a bit of time there
we consider that a very very important part of the world
we have great relationships there
we have a great relationship with finland
and so i would consider many countries threats but these are all threats that we'll be able to handle if we have to
hopefully we won't have to handle them
but if we do we will handle them
we are very protective of that region
that's all i can say
we are very very protective
we have great friends there great relationships that we are extremely protective of
a question for the president
yes
you know sometimes
you have a question for the president
do you have a question for the president
or somebody else can
you don't have to
we had a very good discussion in particular on the arctic and black carbon
and i think we have much in agreement
one of the things we also agree on we want crystal clean water and we want to clean air the cleanest ever
very important
so we have a lot of agreement
john roberts, yes
well, a lot of people think it was the right thing to do john
and actually in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a friday evening i assume the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally
you know the hurricane was just starting
and i pointed out that i had pardoned as we call as we say sheriff joe
he's done a great job for the people of arizona
he's very strong on borders very strong on illegal immigration
he is loved in arizona
i thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started
as you know he lost in a fairly close election
he would have won the election but they just hammered him just before the election
i thought that was a very very unfair thing to do
when i mentioned him the other night you saw the massive crowd we had the people went crazy when i said what do you think of sheriff joe or something to that effect the place went absolutely crazy when i was in arizona last week
and as far as pardons are concerned, i actually did this just before the meeting because i assume that somebody would ask me that question
i didn't know it would be you, as you can attest
you didn't even know you're going to be called
but i thought i would
and you know sheriff joe is a great veteran of the military
great law enforcement person
somebody that's won many many elections in the state of arizona
but i wanted to look at some of the other people that were pardoned over the years
and if you look at as an example, president clinton pardoned marc rich, who is charged with crimes going back decades, including illegally buying oil from iran while it held 53 american hostages
wasn't allowed to do that selling to the enemies of the united states
he was pardoned after his wife donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the clintons
then you have dangerous criminals
president clinton pardoned susan rosenberg a member of the weather underground
charged as part of a bank robbery that led to a guard and two police officers being killed
drug dealers
president clinton commuted the sentence of carlos vignali, a central player in a cocaine ring that stretched from california to minnesota
criminal leaker
you've heard the word leaker
president obama commuted the sentence of chelsea manning, who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to wikileaks
perhaps others
but a horrible horrible thing that he did
commuted the sentence, and perhaps pardoned/ president obama commuted the sentence of oscar lopez rivera who is charged as part of a violent independent group from puerto rico
responsible for 28 chicago area bombings and many deaths in the 1970s and 1980s
sheriff joe is a patriot
sheriff joe loves our country
sheriff joe protected our borders
and sheriff joe was very unfairly treated by the obama administration, especially right before the election, an election that he would have won
and he was elected many times so i stand by my pardon of sheriff joe
and i think the people of arizona who really know him best would agree with me
thank you very much
i know there might be a couple of more questions, but you want to take one more
would you want to take one more
go ahead pick
go ahead
again
you're going to give her the same one
go ahead
go ahead
please
again i'm going to give her the same way
no she's not
go ahead
they are
well i hope that we do have good relations with russia
i say it loud and clear
i've been saying it for years
i think it's a good thing if we have great relationships or at least good relationships with russia
that's very important, and i believe someday that will happen
it's a big country
it's a nuclear country
i's a country that we should get along with
and i think we will eventually get along with russia
finland is respected by russia
finland has been free of russia, really just about one of the few countries in the region that has been for 100 years
and russia has a lot of respect for finland, so that's always good
but i think finland is doing fine with russia and i hope that the united states will someday be able to have a very good relationship with russia also
i think that's very good for world peace and for other things
well, as i said before that you know our relationship with finland is a very close one and we're always ready to help finland
and one of the things that is happening is you're purchasing large amounts of our great f-18 aircraft from boeing, and it's one of the great planes, one of the great fighter jets, and you're purchasing lots of other military equipment
and i think purchasing very wisely
i know all of the military equipment and i actually agree with everything you purchased
we talked about it before
i think finland's really a respected country militarily
it's got large armed forces for its size as a country
really proportionally probably one of the biggest in the world if you think of it
but they're very respected militarily and they're respected beyond militarily
so hopefully it'll never come to that
thank you
go ahead
no i think what's going to happen is the fema money is relatively small compared to the rebuilding money
so fema right now we have the money necessary for texas and louisiana if we need
but the all you know the real number which will be many billions of dollars will go through congress
i think it'll happen very quickly it'll go very fast
and i want to congratulate you on the network
it's a great network
yes it will
one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall
it may be through reimbursement but one way or the other mexico will pay for the
we're right now negotiating nafta
in my opinion mexico has been very difficult, as they should be
why wouldn't they be
they had a sweetheart deal for so many years
it's one of the great deals of all time for them
one of the worst trade deals ever signed
i guarantee you mr
president, finland would never have signed nafta with russia or whoever you wanted
this is not a deal that you would want to sign
this is not a deal that finland would know about
nafta is one of the worst trade deals ever signed at any time anywhere in the world
and i can understand why mexico is being difficult because why wouldn't they be
they've had it their way
but mexico will pay for the wall
it may be through a reimbursement
we need the wall very badly as you know mexico has a tremendous crime problem tremendous
one of the number two or three in the world, and that's another reason we need it
just to add on tremendous drugs pouring into the united states at levels that nobody has ever seen before
this happened over the last three to four years in particular
the wall will stop much of the drugs from pouring into this country and poisoning our youth
so we need the wall
it's imperative
we may fund it through the united states, but ultimately mexico will pay for wall
well, i hope that's not necessary
yeah
i hope that's not necessary
if it's necessary, we'll have to see
but i hope it's not necessary
the wall is needed from the standpoint of security
the wall is needed from the standpoint of drug
tremendous drug scourge
what's coming through and that through that area, through the areas that we're talking about as you know i have general kelly here
we stopped traffic coming through 78 percent
it's going to be i think 81 percent this quarter which is a record
in other administrations if they stopped it just a little bit like one or two or three percent they consider that a great thing we're up to almost 80 percent
we'll soon be over 80 percent
but you need the wall to do the rest
and you need the wall for the drugs the drugs are a tremendous problem
the wall will greatly help with the drug problem
and ultimately that's a good thing for mexico also
we have a very good relationship with mexico
but i will say that dealing with them
i've always said, i've talked about after, you've heard me many times and i've said that we will either terminate it or renegotiate it
we're in the process of renegotiating right now
renegotiating the deal
i believe that you will probably have to at least start the termination process before a fair deal can be arrived at, because it's been a one-sided deal, and this includes canada by the way   great respect for canada, great love for canada   but it's been a one-sided deal for canada and from mexico and the united states workers all of these incredible people who have lost their jobs because of nafta
they're not going to be suffering any longer
it's been unfair for too long
so we will build the wall, and we will stop a lot of things including the drug
the drugs are pouring in at levels like nobody has ever seen will be able to stop them once the wall is up
thank you very much
thank you
thank you everybody
thank you very much
i just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the department of labor will be mr
alex acosta
he has a law degree from harvard law school, was a great student
former clerk for justice samuel alito
and he has had a tremendous career
he's a member and has been a member of the national labor relations board, and has been through senate confirmation three times, confirmed
did very, very well
and so alex, i've wished him the best
we just spoke
and he's going to be   i think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor
and also as you probably heard just a little while ago, mick mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, i have to say that, weeks, weeks late, office of management and budget
and he will be i think a fantastic addition
paul singer just left
as you know, paul was very much involved with the anti-trump or as they say, never trump
and paul just left and he's given us his total support
and it's all about unification
we're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country
it's very important to me
i've been talking about that for a long time
it's very, very important to me
so i want to thank paul singer for being here and for coming up to the office
he was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally
and i appreciate that
i think i'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions
and i had this time
we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible
just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening
and we've done some really good work
we're very proud of that
and then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions
that's always a possibility
i'm here today to update the american people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration
we have made incredible progress
i don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done
a new rasmussen poll, in fact   because the people get it   much of the media doesn't get it
they actually get it, but they don't write it
let's put it that way
but a new rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up
the stock market has hit record numbers, as you know
and there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is   to me means something much different than it used to
it used to mean, oh, that's good
now it means, that's good for jobs
very different
plants and factories are already starting to move back into the united states, and big league   ford, general motors, so many of them
i'm making this presentation directly to the american people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you
this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve
and i hope going forward we can be a little bit   a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible
maybe it's not, and that's ok, too
unfortunately, much of the media in washington, d
, along with new york, los angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system
the press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the american people
tremendous disservice
we have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control
the level of dishonesty is out of control
i ran for president to present the citizens of our country
i am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well
i am talking   and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure
we're talking about its entrenchment
as a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort   not all the time   and some of the media is fantastic, i have to say   they're honest and fantastic
but much of it is not a   the distortion   and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it
but we're not going to let it happen, because i'm here again, to take my message straight to the people
as you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy
to be honest, i inherited a mess
it's a mess
at home and abroad, a mess
jobs are pouring out of the country
you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look
the middle east is a disaster
north korea   we'll take care of it folks
we're going to take care of it all
i just want to let you know, i inherited a mess
beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges
on foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many
we have had great conversations with the united kingdom, and meetings
israel, mexico, japan, china and canada, really, really productive conversations
i would say far more productive than you would understand
we've even developed a new council with canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs
it's very important to me, very important to my daughter ivanka
i have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now secretary mattis
he's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of isis, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world
it used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world
they've spread like cancer
isis has spread like cancer   another mess i inherited
and we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved
and it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements i've ever seen drawn by anybody
i've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the united states military
had great support from the senate, i've had great from congress, generally
we've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and i will tell you that is my   i would be so happy if we never had to use it
but our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild
we have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old
i used it
i talked about it at every stop
depleted, it's depleted   it won't be depleted for long
and i think one of the reason i'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, i talked about we have to have a strong military
we have to have a strong law enforcement also
so we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength
at home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years
in each of these actions, i'm keeping my promises to the american people
these are campaign promises
some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders
well, that's what i've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders
they're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what i've been talking about to the press and to everybody else
one promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected
they lied to the american people in order to get elected
some of the things i'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons
and then coming to washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians
i'm here following through on what i pledged to do
that's all i'm doing
i put it out before the american people, got 306 electoral college votes
i wasn't supposed to get 222
they said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible
270 which you need, that was laughable
we got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes
i guess it was the biggest electoral college win since ronald reagan
in other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason
and   but a lot of people are happy about it
in fact, i'll be in melbourne, florida five o'clock on saturday and i heard   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there
i turn on the t
, open the newspapers and i see stories of chaos
chaos
yet it is the exact opposite
this administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that i can't get my cabinet approved
and they're outstanding people like senator dan coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the senate
he can't get approved
how do you not approve him
he's been a colleague   highly respected
brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it
we're waiting for approval
so we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen
so, if the democrats who have   all you have to do is look at where they are right now
the only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me
let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time
i just got here
and i got here with no cabinet
again, each of these actions is a promise i made to the american people
i'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks   in the weeks coming
we've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as trans pacific partnership
we're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral
we're going to have one on one deals
we've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for america and american infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories
people take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory
they go in for a permit, it's many, many years
and then at the end of the process   they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected
now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection
not going to take years
but mostly it's going to be an acceptance
we want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs
we don't want the jobs going to other countries
we've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers
we've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations
we've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated
makes sense
nobody's ever seen regulations like we have
you go to other countries and you look at indexes they have and you say let me see your regulations and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have
and i want regulations because i want safety, i want environmental   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of
it's very important to me
but you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing
we've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence
we've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in america, including the horrendous situation   take a look at chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities
horrible
we've ordered the department of homeland security and justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the united states with drugs
we're becoming a drug infested nation
drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars
we are not going to let it happen any longer
we've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe
and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general   now secretary kelly yesterday and we're starting that process
and the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me
the price is going to come down just like it has on everything else i've negotiated for the government
and we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke
we've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border
no more release
no matter who you are, release
we have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety
we are saving american lives every single day
the court system has not made it easy for us
and are even creating a new office in homeland security dedicated to the forgotten american victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many
we have taken decisive action to keep radical islamic terrorists out of our country
no parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling
our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe
and is vigorously defending this lawful order
i will not back down from defending our country
i got elected on defense of our country
i keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result
they already are, i can tell you that
extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places
in fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number
i have heard 80 percent, i find that hard to believe, that is just a number i heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time
i think that circuit is   that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil
but we are appealing that, and we are going further
we're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country
so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people
that will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part
we have also taken steps to begin construction of the keystone pipeline and dakota access pipelines
thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy american measures in place to require american steel for american pipelines
in other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use american steel
and they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before i came along
even this order was drawn and they didn't say that
and i'm reading the order, i'm saying, why aren't we using american steel
and they said, that's a good idea, we put it in
to drain the swamp of corruption in washington, d
, i've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on white house officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government
we've begun preparing to repeal and replace obamacare
obamacare is a disaster, folks
it is's disaster
i know you can say, oh, obamacare
i mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the republican people our that representatives are representing
so we've begun preparing to repeal and replace obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country
big league
it's already happening
but big league
i've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of senate democrats
you've seen what they've done over the last long number of years
that will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in american history
you look at rex tillerson
he's out there negotiating right now
general mattis i mentioned before, general kelly
we have great, great people
mick is with us now
we have great people
among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens
now look, fair trade
not free, fair
if a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore
every country takes advantage of us almost
i may be able to find a couple that don't
but for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do
jobs have already started to surge
since my election, ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in michigan, creating many, many jobs
fiat chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in ohio and michigan, creating 2,000 new american jobs
they were with me a week ago
you know you were here
general motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its american manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave
and if i didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left
and these jobs and these things that i'm announcing would never have come here
intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with
and that will result in at least 10,000 american jobs
walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the united states just this year because of our various plans and initiatives
there will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming
other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades   decades, and decades, and decades, folks
and we're not going to let that happen anymore
not going to let it happen
and one more thing, i have kept my promise to the american people by nominating a justice of the united states supreme court, judge neil gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the democrats
you may not see that
but he'll get there one way or the other
but he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes
this last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country
again, i say it
there has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time
and we have not even started the big work yet
that starts early next week
some very big things are going to be announced next week
so we are just getting started
we will be giving a speech, as i said, in melbourne, florida, at 5
00 p
i hope to see you there
and with that, i just say, god bless america, and let's take some questions
mara, mara, go ahead
you were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference
mike flynn is a fine person, and i asked for his resignation
he respectfully gave it
he is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to vice president pence, who is with us today
and i was not happy with the way that information was given
he didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong   what he did in terms of the information he saw
what was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally
that's the real problem
and, you know, you can talk all you want about russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the democrats and the press plays right into it
in fact, i saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this   that they know nothing about it
they weren't in russia
they never made a phone call to russia
they never received a phone call
it's all fake news
it's all fake news
the nice thing is, i see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal   i think it's very important   the illegal, giving out classified information
it was   and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much
i'll give you an example
i called, as you know, mexico
it was a very, very confidential, classified call
but i called mexico
and in calling mexico, i figured, oh, well that's   i spoke to the president of mexico
i had a good call
all of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see
it's supposed to be secret
it's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case
same thing with australia
all of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place
the same thing happened with respect to general flynn
everybody saw this
and i'm saying   the first thing i thought of when i heard about it is
how does the press get this information that's classified
how do they do it
you know why
because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves
but more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed
yes, go ahead
because when i looked at the information, i said, i don't think he did anything wrong
if anything, he did something right
he was coming into office
he looked at the information
he said, huh, that's fine
that's what they're supposed to do
they're supposed to   he didn't just call russia
he called and spoke to both ways, i think there were 30-some-odd countries
he's doing the job
you know, he was doing his job
the thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember
so either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me
and i have somebody that i think will be outstanding for the position
and that also helps, i think, in the making of my decision
but he didn't tell the vice president of the united states the facts
and then he didn't remember
and that just wasn't acceptable to me
yes
the failing new york times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday
and it was very much discredited, as you know
it was   it's a joke
and the people mentioned in the story, i notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to russia
they weren't even a part, really   i mean, they were such a minor part
they   i hadn't spoken to them
i think the one person   i don't think i've ever spoken to him
i don't think i've ever met him
and he actually said he was a very low-level member of i think a committee for a short period of time
i don't think i ever met him
now, it's possible that i walked into a room and he was sitting there, but i don't think i ever met him
i didn't talk to him ever
and he thought it was a joke
the other person said he never spoke to russia
never received a call
look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera
and the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but i don't think he represented russia, but knew that he represented various countries
that's what he does
i mean, people know that
that's mr
manafort, who's   by the way, who's by the way a respected man
he's a respected man
but i think he represented the ukraine or ukraine government or somebody, but everybody   people knew that
everybody knew that
so, these people   and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with russia
and he said that very forcefully
i saw his statement
he said it very forcefully
most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories
so the three people that they talked about all totally deny it
and i can tell you, speaking for myself, i own nothing in russia
i have no loans in russia
i don't have any deals in russia
president putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election
he then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific
but so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country
so that's the extent
russia is fake news
russia   this is fake news put out by the media
the real news is the fact that people, probably from the obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now
as you know, mike pompeo has   has now taken control of the cia, james comey at fbi, dan coats is waiting to be approved, i mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved
but our new people are going in
and just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, wall street journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing new york time's story, yesterday
and it talked about   these are front page
so director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the united states intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true
so they took this front page story out of the wall street journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true
and i'll tell you something, i'll be honest, because i sort of enjoy this back and forth that i guess i have all my life but i've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media
i thought the financial media was much better, much more honest
but i will say that, i never get phone calls from the media
how did they write a story like that in the wall street journal without asking me or how did they write a story in the new york times, put it on front page
that was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story
and it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like mr
trump
they called up my office, we like mr
trump, we never said that
and it was totally   they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, i have to tell you, totally misrepresented
i said give us the retraction
they never gave us a retraction and frankly, i then went on to other things
ok, go ahead
yeah
i'm skipping that information, i don't know, i was just given we had a very, very big margin
well, i don't know, i was given that information
i was given   i actually, i've seen that information around
but it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that
ok thank you, that's
go ahead sir, yes
we are
well, first of all about that, we now have dan coats, hopefully soon, mike pompeo and james comey and they're in position so i hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else
the gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of
but i don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, i think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own
as far as the general's concerned, when i first heard about it, i said huh, that doesn't sound wrong
my counsel came, don mcgahn, white house counsel, and he told me and i asked him, he can speak very well for himself
he said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think
it was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong
i didn't either because i waited a period of time and i started to think about it, i said well i don't see   to me, he was doing the job
the information was provided by   who i don't know, sally yates
and i was a little surprised because i said doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there
but he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and i thought that was not acceptable
as far as   as far as the actual making the call, fact i've watched various programs and i've read various articles where he was just doing his job
that was very normal
you know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong
after they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job
so   and i do
and by the way, with all of that being said, i do think he's a fine man
go ahead
finish off then i'll get you
yes, we're looking at them very   very, very serious
i've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're   i've actually called the justice department to look into the leaks
those are criminal leaks
they're put out by people either in agencies   i think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in
you know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the senate
we just had jeff sessions approved
injustice, as an example
so, we are looking into that very seriously
it's a criminal act
you know what i say, when i   when i was called out on mexico, i was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment   when i was called out on mexico, i was   honestly, i was really, really surprised
but i said you know, it doesn't make sense
that won't happen but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, i could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way
same thing with australia
i said that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important
but then i said to myself what happens when i'm dealing with the problem of north korea
what happens when i'm dealing with the problems in the middle east
are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very   you know, i mean at the highest level
are you going to be reporting about that too
so, i don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test
so i'm dealing with mexico, i'm dealing with argentina, we were dealing on this case with mike flynn
all this information gets put into the washington post and gets put into the new york times and i'm saying what's going to happen when i'm dealing on the middle east
what's going to happen when i'm dealing with really, really important subjects like north korea
we got to stop it
that's why it's a criminal penalty
well the leaks are real
you're the one that wrote about them and reported them, i mean the leaks are real
you know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real
the news is fake because so much of the news is fake
so one thing that i felt it was very important to do   and i hope we can correct it
because there's nobody i have more respect for   well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters
it's very important to me and especially in this position
it's very important
i don't mind bad stories
i can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, i'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and i'm ok with that
but i'm not ok when it is fake
i mean, i watch cnn, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred
i don't watch it any more because it's very good   he's saying no
it's ok, jim
it's ok, jim, you'll have your chance
but i watch others too
you're not the only one so don't feel badly
but i think it should be straight
i think it should be   i think it would be frankly more interesting
i know how good everybody's ratings are right now but i think that actually   i think that'd actually be better
people   i mean, you have a lower approval rate than congress
i think that's right
i don't know, peter, is that one right
because you know i think they have lower   i heard lower than congress
but honestly, the public would appreciate it, i'd appreciate it   again, i don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the democrats are making it very difficult
i think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet
i mean, the numbers are crazy
when i'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately
i'm going forever and i still have a lot of people that we're waiting for
and that's all they're doing, is delaying
and you look at schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going
the only thing they can do is delay
and, you know, i think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good
and sometimes   i mean, i know president obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's ok
that's fine
but i think it would   i think they would be much better served, john, if they just went through the process quickly
this is pure delay tactics
and they say it, and everybody understands it
yeah, go ahead, jimmy
well, i had nothing to do with it
i have nothing to do with russia
i told you, i have no deals there, i have no anything
now, when wikileaks, which i had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information
they're giving stuff   what was said at an office about hillary cheating on the debates
which, by the way, nobody mentions
nobody mentions that hillary received the questions to the debates
can you imagine   seriously   can you imagine if i received the questions
it would be the electric chair
ok, he should be put in the electric   you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, ok
maybe not you john
yes
we'll do you next jim, i do you next
yes, yes, sure
no, i didn't
no, i didn't
no, i didn't
excuse me
no, i fired him because of what he said to mike pence
very simple
mike was doing his job
he was calling countries and his counterparts
so, it certainly would have been ok with me if he did it
i would have directed him to do it if i thought he wasn't doing it
i didn't direct him, but i would have directed him because that's his job
and it came out that way   and in all fairness, i watched dr
charles krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and i agreed with him
and since then, i've watched many other people say that
no, i didn't direct him, but i would have directed him if he didn't do it
jim
ask   ask jeff zucker how he got his job
well, that's   well, you know, we do have other people
you do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting
ok, go ahead, john
i was ok with it
well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that
no   no, but i did say 30
but it was actually higher than that
ok, fair question
ready
no   no, but let me do one at a time
do you mind
all right
so, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information
in the other case, you're talking about john podesta saying bad things about the boss
i will say this, if john podesta said that about me and he was working for me, i would have fired him so fast your head would have spun
he said terrible things about her
but it wasn't classified information
but in one case, you're talking about classified   regardless, if you look at the rnc, we had a very strong   at my suggestion   and i give reince great credit for this   at my suggestion, because i know something about this world, i said i want a very strong defensive mechanism
i don't want to be hacked
and we did that
and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed
the dnc did not do that
and if they did it, they could not have been hacked
but they were hacked and terrible things came in
and, you know, the only thing that i do think is unfair is some of the things were so   they were   when i heard some of those things i picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers
again, if i had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers
i would have been headline in every newspaper
i mean, think of it
they gave her the questions to a debate and she   and she should have reported herself
why did hillary clinton announce that, i'm sorry, but i have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and i feel that it's inappropriate, and i want to turn in cnn for not doing a good job
the reporting is fake
look, look
you know what it is
here's the thing
the public isn't   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch
they don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved
i'm involved
i've been involved with this stuff all my life
but i'm involved
so i know when you're telling the truth or when you're not
i just see many, many untruthful things
and i'll tell you what else i see
i see tone
you know the word tone
the tone is such hatred
i'm really not a bad person, by the way
no, but the tone is such   i do get good ratings, you have to admit that   the tone is such hatred
i watched this morning a couple of the networks
and i have to say, fox & friends in the morning, they're very honorable people
they're very   not because they're good, because they hit me also when i do something wrong
but they have the most honest morning show
that's all i can say
it's the most honest
but the tone, jim
if you look   the hatred
the, i mean, sometimes   sometimes somebody gets
well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening
you just take a look at that show
that is a constant hit
the panel is almost always exclusive anti-trump
the good news is he doesn't have good ratings
but the panel is almost exclusive anti-trump
and the hatred and venom coming from his mouth
the hatred coming from other people on your network
now, i will say this
i watch it
i see it
i'm amazed by it
and i just think you'd be a lot better off, i honestly do
the public gets it, you know
look, when i go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at cnn
they want to throw their placards at cnn
you know
i   i think you would do much better by being different
but you just take a look
take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening
if a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's   it's brutal
now, they'll take this news conference   i'm actually having a very good time, ok
but they'll take this news conference   don't forget, that's the way i won
remember, i used to give you a news conference every time i made a speech, which was like every day
no, that's how i won
i won with news conferences and probably speeches
i certainly didn't win by people listening to you people
that's for sure
but i'm having a good time
tomorrow, they will say, donald trump rants and raves at the press
i'm not ranting and raving
i'm just telling you
you know, you're dishonest people
but   but i'm not ranting and raving
i love this
i'm having a good time doing it
but tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, donald trump rants and raves
i'm not ranting and raving
go ahead
should i let him have a little bit more
what do you think, peter
peter, should i have   let him have a little bit more
sit down
sit down
we'll
i'm changing it from fake news, though
very fake news
go ahead
and you're not related to our new
i looked   you know, i looked at that name
i said, wait a minute, is there any relation there
alex acosta
now i checked it   i said   they said, no, sir
i said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree
i do that
no, no
i do that
here's the thing
i understand what you're   and you're right about that, except this
see, i know when i should get good and when i should get bad
and sometimes i'll say, wow, that's going to be a great story
and i'll get killed
i know what's good and bad
i'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you
but i know what's good
i know what's bad
and when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive   sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make ok
they'll even make it negative
so i understand it
so, because i'm there
i know what was said
i know who's saying it
i'm there
so it's very important to me
look, i want to see an honest press
when i started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press
the press   the public doesn't believe you people anymore
now, maybe i had something to do with that
i don't know
but they don't believe you
if you were straight and really told it like it is, as howard cosell used to say, right
of course, he had some questions also
but if you were straight, i would be your biggest booster
i would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me
but if you go   as an example, you're cnn, i mean it's story after story after story is bad
i won
i won
and the other thing, chaos because zero chaos
we are running   this is a fine-tuned machine and reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press
you know, i said to him yesterday this whole russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but i watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper
and i'm saying here's my chief of staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at rnc
i mean, he won the election, right
we won the presidency
we got some senators, we got some   all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job
and i said to myself, you know   and i said to somebody that was in the room, i said you take a look at reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires
i mean, they're fake
they're not true
and isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, jim
i mean that
i would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right
i sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by jeff or somebody, you know   you know, whatever reason
but   and i understand that
but you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it
they see it
they see it's not fair
you take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred
and the public is smart, they understand it
go ahead
i think they don't believe it
i don't think the public   that's why the rasmussen poll just has me through the roof
i don't think they believe it
well, i guess one of the reasons i'm here today is to tell you the whole russian thing, that's a ruse
that's a ruse
and by the way, it would be great if we could get along with russia, just so you understand that
now tomorrow, you'll say donald trump wants to get along with russia, this is terrible
it's not terrible
it's good
we had hillary clinton try and do a reset
we had hillary clinton give russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country
you know what uranium is, right
this thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things
nobody talks about that
i didn't do anything for russia
i've done nothing for russia
hillary clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium
hillary clinton did a reset, remember
with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks
here, take a look
he looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button
hillary clinton   that was the reset, remember it said reset
now if i do that, oh, i'm a bad guy
if we could get along with russia, that's a positive thing
we have a very talented man, rex tillerson, who's going to be meeting with them shortly and i told him
i said i know politically it's probably not good for me
the greatest thing i could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water
everyone in this country's going to say oh, it's so great
that's not great
that's not great
i would love to be able to get along with russia
now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack
look where we are now
look where we are now
so, if i can   now, i love to negotiate things, i do it really well, and all that stuff
but   but it's possible i won't be able to get along with putin
maybe it is
but i want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with russia
and probably putin said you know
he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying you know, i see what's going on in the united states, i follow it closely
it's going to be impossible for president trump to ever get along with russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story
and that's a shame because if we could get along with russia   and by the way, china and japan and everyone
if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing
tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly
we're doing obamacare
we're in final stages
we should be submitting the initial plan in march, early march, i would say
and we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first
it's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner
so we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early march, mid-march
and after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform
yes
not good
not good
excuse me, excuse me
when did it happen
it happened when, if you were putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the united states
there's no way trump can ever do a deal with us
because the   you have to understand
if i was just brutal on russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful
but i know you well enough
then you would say, oh, he was too tough
he shouldn't have done that
look, all of the
wait a minute
wait, wait
excuse me just one second
all of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal
so hillary clinton tries a re-set
it failed
they all tried
but i'm different than those people
go ahead
i have
i have
and i'm so beautifully represented
i'm so honored that the senate approved him
he's going to be fantastic
yes, i think that i've already
no, i don't think so
i think putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal
i can't believe i'm saying i'm a politician, but i guess that's what i am now
because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on russia, but then we're not going to make a deal
now, i don't know that we're going to make a deal
i don't know
we might
we might not
but it would be much easier for me to be so tough   the tougher i am on russia, the better
but you know what
i want to do the right thing for the american people
and to be honest, secondarily, i want to do the right thing for the world
if russia and the united states actually got together and got along   and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they
there's no up-side
we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they
i have been briefed
and i can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other
they're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we
if we have a good relationship with russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing
who did i say is not good
no, it's not good, but they happened
they all happened recently
they all happened recently
and i understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing
now, again, maybe i'm not going to be able to do a deal with russia, but at least i will have tried
and if i don't, does anybody really think that hillary clinton would be tougher on russia than donald trump
does anybody in this room really believe that
but i tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal
she had the re-set
she gave all that valuable uranium away
she did other things
you know, they say i'm close to russia
hillary clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the united states
she's close to russia
i gave   you know what i gave to russia
you know what i gave
nothing
